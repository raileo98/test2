 SAR sailor Nicholas Halliday on Saturday improved his overall ranking in the men's dinghy, going up by three places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old completed two more races – coming in 6th place in the second one – on the third day of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday has four more races to go over the next two days in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is now ranked 25th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 89 net points, compared with 63 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China, women's swimmers on Saturday finished their 4x100 metres medley relay ranked 13th out of 14 teams, saying they all very much enjoyed their last race at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephanie Au, Siobhan Haughey, Natalie Kan and Karen Tam clocked a time of four minutes and 3.56 seconds, nearly two seconds short of the Hong Kong record the four hold, and more than a second slower than their Paris entry time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au, competing in her fifth Olympics, had a strong start, as she helped the team stay in the middle of the pack in the backstroke leg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when Haughey finished off her breaststroke leg, the SAR squad was among the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kan and Tam tried to catch up in butterfly and freestyle, but to no avail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They ended up being seventh in their heat, with Denmark being disqualified. Team Australia won the heat and were the fastest entering the finals, with Team China second in the heat and third overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au described their finishing time as less than ideal, but the swimmer said she was thankful for the experience because she had many family and friends in the stands cheering for her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said she was pleased with her overall performance in Paris, saying she very much enjoyed being with her fellow relay swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think when you evaluate a competition, you don't just look at the results because there are a lot of details behind it. You don't just determine [a competition] with the time and rank," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kan, making her Olympic debut, said while their time fell short of expectations, she had no regrets because she knew the whole team already did the best they could.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam said everyone enjoyed the experience and thanked the Hongkongers in the stands who travelled all the way to Paris to support them.

  <br/>
  <br/>

    HK sprinter Felix Diu unable to advance in 100m

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Felix Diu (C) was very close to advancing to the next round. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764597_2_20240803222636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu was on Saturday eliminated in the preliminary round of the men’s 100m race, finishing fourth in his heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He was unable to establish a new SAR record with a time of 10.62 seconds, just 0.02 seconds short of coming in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Noa Jerrel Bibi of Mauritius came first in the heat with a time of 10.27 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu's time was 0.34 seconds short of the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top two in each heat and the four fastest runners from the rest of the pack can advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100-metre specialist entered the Olympics through a wild card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic qualification for the 100m dash is 10 seconds and Diu’s personal best, which is also his best time this year, is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the race, Diu expressed disappointment with his performance, saying he had been dealing with a leg injury, and that has affected his training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, my condition wasn't as good as it was when I clocked a 10.33, so perhaps I will just work harder next time, and in competitions next year," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While being the third Hong Kong sprinter in history to make it to the 100m race at the Games, the sprinter, 24, said he learnt quite a lot from his "unforgettable" Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a rather shocking and exciting experience. There are so many spectators in the stadium cheering for athletes, it's really something different."

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764594_2_20240803172132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Saturday announced it will offer daily flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh from October 27, up from the current five trips per week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came after the CEO of the SAR's flag carrier, Ronald Lam, signed an agreement to boost its partnership with Cambodia Airports during Chief Executive John Lee's recent six-day Asean trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision is also part of Cathay's plan to prepare for the completion of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group emphasised that it will continue to strengthen its existing routes, as well as expand its network and collaboration with Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, this year marks the 75th anniversary since Cathay operated its inaugural flight to Vietnam. The airline announced that it will kick off another round of recruitment in the country this month, after welcoming more than 170 Vietnamese flight attendants earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And low-cost airline Hong Kong Express, which is owned by Cathay, is planning to start flights between Hong Kong and Phu Quoc – a Vietnamese island – in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay currently flies to 17 Asean destinations, with over 360 flights per week.

 Customs on Saturday said they arrested three men after finding nearly HK$6 million worth of suspected heroin inside a shipment of durians and mochi at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said the air consignment containing 8.4 kilogrammes of the drug came from Malaysia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers on Friday found 24 packs of heroin in the shipment, which was declared as carrying the pungent fruit and mochi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then arrested three men aged 25 to 53 in Mong Kok on the same day during a "controlled delivery operation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added an investigation is ongoing.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Speaking on a radio programme, Rosanna Law pointed out that the figure is equivalent to a medium-sized public housing estate. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764573_1_20240803120315.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority has taken back 5,000 public rental housing units from tenants over the past two years, after they were found to have been abusing public housing resources, the Director of Housing Rosanna Law said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Law pointed out that the figure is equivalent to a medium-sized public housing estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chun Yeung Estate in Fo Tan provides around 4,800 units. Therefore, by recovering 5,000 units due to tenancy abuse is equivalent to a medium-sized estate," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the recovered flats are located in developed or urban areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said renovation for the retrieved flats would only take a few months, and they then could be allocated to people on the waiting list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department has been working with property management companies to combat tenancy abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far, 38 flats have been taken back after companies filed reports of suspected system abuse, and Law said the results are "very encouraging".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had required 250,000 public housing tenants residing for over 10 years to submit an income and assets declaration form by the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the programme, Law revealed that it has already received 254,000 forms, which is more than 99 per cent of all the households.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are 70 units from which we have not received declaration forms, despite repeated chasing and reminders. For these, we have already started our process of taking back their housing units."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official also added that the Housing Authority hadn't set any target on how many public rental housing units it would take back this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the beginning of this financial year 2024-25, we have already up to date resumed 700 flats, under the anti-abuse campaign. So we are expecting similar numbers in the coming seasons, and the overall full year figures should be similar to previous years," she said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Security Bureau Chief Chris Tang said the proposed cybersecurity bill will only focus on protecting computer systems from hackers. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764572_1_20240803115813.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security Bureau Chief Chris Tang said on Saturday the proposed legislation to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity will not undermine privacy protection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment after the bureau submitted a paper to the Legislative Council, that would require the reporting of cybersecurity incidents by operators crucial to the normal functioning of society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the bureau would only focus on protecting computer systems from hackers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly the legislation targets critical infrastructure, there will be no effect on small- and medium-sized enterprises and individuals. Secondly, we have no interest in the personal information and the operational information included in the critical infrastructure. Our goal is to protect the system so it will not be attacked and therefore affect members of the public when services are disrupted," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang highlighted that the government will only view company's information after obtaining a warrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed legislative framework, operators are required to set up a computer system security management unit, conduct a security risk assessment at least once every year, and an independent security audit at least once every two years, and report serious security incidents within two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penalties ranging from HK$500,000 to HK$5 million will apply to organisations that fail to comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the bureau received 53 submissions throughout the bill's consultation period, which came to an end on Thursday. Among all submissions, 47 of them were from industry sectors. 52 supported the proposed law and one from a United Kingdom human rights organisation opposed it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such legislation is not unique to Hong Kong. Similar regulations are also implemented in Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that radio stations and television broadcasters are critical infrastructures, and the government will not intervene in day-to-day operations of newsrooms and news content.

 A 52-year-old Hong Kong man has drowned on the Thai resort island of Phuket while swimming with his teenage son, it emerged on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department confirmed receiving a request for help from the man's family, and pledged to render all necessary assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Thai media, the duo decided to take a dip at the famous Patong beach on Wednesday when the father began drifting away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His son notified lifesavers, who pulled the man ashore on a jet ski. He was already unconscious and was eventually pronounced dead in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said it had contacted the Chinese consulate in the southern Thai province of Songkhla, with the help of the Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said the department will remain in close contact with all relevant parties and provide assistance according to the family's wishes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR residents needing help overseas are urged to call its 24-hour hotline, (852)1868, or send a message through WhatsApp using the same number.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday maintained a steady position in the pack after two more races in the men's dinghy event, with six still to come over the next three days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ranked 28th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 65 net points, compared with 32 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said there were about 160,000 technology crime cases in the first half of the year, a 3.5 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said the total loss incurred in the cases amounted to HK$2.66 billion, and that they noted a surge in the use of blackmail apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Superintendent Raymond Lam of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said tech crime in Hong Kong is on the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said though hacker groups are operating in the city, most cases involved overseas groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested that companies should be proactive when it comes to updating their devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of systems which the users do not update on time. If software and hardware are not updated on time, it will have a lot of loopholes. Therefore systems should be updated on time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Policy Office, meanwhile, said it checks government systems regularly, and it has not discovered loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Assistant Commissioner Daniel Cheung said they conduct spot checks, and any loopholes will be plugged immediately if any are found.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Friday fought hard for the best rank he could get in the men’s single sculls at the Paris Olympic Games, despite dropping out of contention for a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu began in the second lane of the final group D race, where he was competing for the 19th to 24th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started off second in the first 500 metres, before pulling himself to the front of the pack in the next 1,000 metres. But Quentin Antognelli of Monaco came from behind to overtake Chiu in the end with a time of 6 minutes and 54.93 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we were unable to get a medal, I hope this serves as motivation and inspiration for younger rowers," Chiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want them to fight hard for their dreams and dream big, and we can have higher and faster results in future international events,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who finished second out of six in his race with a time of 6 minutes and 56.65 seconds, ranked 20th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He previously competed in the Rio Olympic Games, where he finished 19th in the lightweight double sculls.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed his six-day trip to Southeast Asia for allowing him to "meet new friends and strength past relationships", with a total of 55 non-binding deals signed with three countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "[We signed] twelve with Laos, 13 with Cambodia and 30 with Vietnam, covering a wide range of cooperative areas, such as trade and economic partnership, investment, customs collaboration, education, cultural exchanges and tourism promotion," he told reporters in Ho Chi Minh City on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have confirmed the support from the three countries' governments for Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an earlier luncheon with business leaders, Lee pledged to strengthen ties with Asean countries and reiterated his wish for Hong Kong to join the free trade pact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is making good use of the free trade agreement and investment agreement between Asean and Hong Kong to deepen our collaboration with Vietnam and other Asean countries. And we are eager to go beyond those free trade agreements," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope, too, to join RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Through RCEP, I'm confident Hong Kong can make an even bigger contribution to the overall economic growth of Vietnam, Asean and the larger Asian region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also met Vietnamese politicians on his last day, including the chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, Phan Van Mai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other visits included a trip to a Hong Kong-owned garment manufacturing factory, where the firm's chief executive officer was quoted as saying the company will continue to keep its headquarters in the SAR and attract talent from Asean countries to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR delegation was returning to Hong Kong on Friday evening.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Brands and Products Shopping Festival features more than 250 stalls and is expected to attract 60,000 visitors. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764428_1_20240802161229.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day annual shopping festival kicked off on Friday at AsiaWorld-Expo, with organisers offering free admission to bargain hunters on opening day in celebration of Hong Kong's success at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, visitors and exhibitors at the Brands and Products Shopping Festival, organised by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, pointed to smaller crowds than usual at the fair that runs until August 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event, featuring over 250 stalls, was expected to attract 60,000 visitors and generate some HK$60 million in sales revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ivan Sze, the association's vice-president, said he's not worried that sales would be affected by Hongkongers heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists being raised, we hope more mainland visitors will come to the festival to spend," Sze said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For Hongkongers heading north, dining accounts for a large proportion of their spending. But they may not buy too much across the border, because such consumption depends on the products themselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vendor surnamed Ng was selling sparkling wine at the fair and said there were several mainland tour groups visiting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were around 20 to 30 percent of visitors from the mainland. And with organisers offering free admissions, the number of people coming on the first day was about 20 to 30 percent more than last year's opening day," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It would already be great for sales this year to match the previous year's levels... I hope the government can introduce more new promotional deals, or stimulate the retail sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor from the Netherlands, who gave his name as Hugo, said he did not see a lot of overseas visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy with the people who are there, but I hope there are more people in the weekend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Macau resident surnamed Lau came to Hong Kong just for the festival and spent around HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere was quite nice, and people were very friendly. The vendors were fair when doing business, and they were courteous," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tseung Kwan O resident surnamed Cheung said it took her two hours to travel from home to the event venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I did not have a voucher [for the festival], I might not have come... It seemed to have few people here. It's only the first day and there were only a handful of people," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An advocacy group on Friday called for more government support for people raising children with special educational needs (SEN).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People Service Centre said a survey it carried out involving the caregivers of 175 children with special educational needs found almost 65 percent would like to be able to work, while 80 percent said existing employment support on offer was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social worker Zoe Lam said mothers caring for such children can find their responsibilities overwhelming, while a lack of flexibility in the workplace prevents them from getting a job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “One of our SEN caregivers, she tried to find [childcare] services but she experienced being rejected a number of times because her son was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia,” said Lam
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to 10 percent of the survey respondents said they had been denied childcare services because of their child's emotional or behavioural condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advocacy group called for more family-friendly employment policies, employment subsidies, employer incentives and the improvement of SEN childcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want these four recommendations to be put in the 2024 Policy Address, because now caregivers do not have the choice to choose between personal development and taking care of their families," Lam said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers should avoid sharing photos or videos of themselves too widely to reduce the risk of scammers hijacking their images, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Chung said fraudsters are using technology to create deepfake images and videos to trick people into handing over money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong employees of two multinational companies have fallen victim to such scams this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If people really like sharing photos and videos of themselves, they should only share it with a specific audience group or privately. This will already make it much safer. They do not have to share it publicly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said her office received around 600 enquiries relating to fraud in the first six months of the year, up nearly 90 percent on the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said most involved phone scams, including cases where callers impersonated employees of various organisations to try to get people to give away personal information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencer Edgar Cheung returned to a hero's welcome from the Paris Games on Friday saying he still can't believe he managed to become the first athlete in decades to defend a men's foil title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who's also the first-ever SAR competitor to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals, was greeted by a crowd of fans as he arrived at the airport
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Never give up trying our best to give everything... because for me, it's what I train for, for the Olympics and every day I train hard to be in a good condition to fence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said his only regret from the Games was that the men’s foil team didn't qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said every SAR athlete gives their very best and they deserve respect regardless of whether they win a medal or not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he's going to have a big holiday before getting back to training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We prepared for the Olympics for the past three years. It was hard, it was tough and physically, mentally, I'm quite tired. So for me now, I just want to have a good rest and to prepare for the next season,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having spent a lot of time in France, Cheung said he was craving Hong Kong cuisine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he had no plans yet on what to do with his HK$6 million prize money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on Italy's complaint and suggestions of bias over his victory against Filippo Macchi, Cheung said referees always follow fencing rules, even if they sometimes have different interpretations. He added that the referees in Paris were all professional and experienced.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say a 59-year-old man has died after reportedly collapsing while driving a medium goods vehicle near Hong Kong International Airport and crashing into a kerb.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The incident happened on Friday morning as the driver was entering a car park at 9 Chun Wan Road.
  <br/>

  The man was rushed to North Lantau Hospital where he was certified dead.
  <br/>

 The Fire Services Department on Thursday said it conducted around 6,900 checks at about 700 old residential and commercial buildings as of the end of last month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said inspections were stepped up after a fatal fire in a Jordan residential block in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Fire Officer Michael Yung said the common hazards identified during the inspections included defective smoke-stop doors and obstructed escape routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the department will take legal action against those who ignore warning notices and fail to carry out improvement works.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For these inspections, we have issued about [5,000] fire hazard abatement notices, and we will likely take legal action against 264 offences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung added the department aims to inspect 1,000 high-risk old buildings by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the department prosecuted over 1,000 cases for non-compliance to fire safety directions in the first half of the year, a threefold increase compared to the previous year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Hong Kong swimmers on Thursday failed to make it out of the heats at Paris La Defense Arena, bringing their Olympic journeys to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cindy Cheung, the youngest member to represent the SAR in swimming, competed in the women’s 200m backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old maintained a steady pace in her heat against two others, finishing in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She clocked 2 minutes 17.32 seconds, more than 4 seconds behind the winner Tatiana Salcutan of Moldova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who came 26th overall among 27 swimmers, said she was not happy with her performance but that her experience in Paris had been invaluable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the end, this was a very good learning experience. I got to see how the Olympic Village was like, and experienced what it was like to compete at such a high level – the feeling is very different," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though my finishing time was not up to my expectations, this was an experience that's hard to come by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men’s side, Ian Ho also concluded his second Olympics in the pool after he failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the men’s 50m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old came last in his heat with a time of 22.12 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished in joint 24th place out of 73 swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really can’t complain. It’s been a good Olympics for me, and to have such a different experience from last time...Really, I’m grateful for what I’ve been able to do," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and Ho were eliminated from the women’s 100m backstroke and the men’s 100m freestyle earlier.

    Fraud alert system to cover bank transactions

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An alert that warns people using the Faster Payment System (FPS) they could be about to lose money to fraudsters is being extended to transactions made in banks or via online banking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From August 4, bank customers will receive an alert if they are on the verge of making a transfer to a recipient flagged as high-risk by the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Chu, executive director in banking supervision at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said the extended alert system will offer people more protection from scammers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After this expansion, the coverage of bank transfer transactions will increase from 35 percent to 84 percent. It basically has a wide coverage of the fund transfer transactions, and it will enhance the protection to customers to send the high-risk alerts to them to warn them before they execute a transaction," Chu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Lam from the police's Cyber Security and Technology Bureau said the fraud alert system has been effective since its launch in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of the end of June this year, our system has issued more than 650,000 high-risk alerts. That is an average of one warning for every 30 seconds, which is effectively reminding people of the risk of a scam," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Projected from the average loss of about HK$1,500 per each scam case, and we anticipate the high-risk alert has so far issued a warning of scams [involving] nearly HK$1 billion."

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has encouraged Hong Kong entrepreneurs to better integrate into national reform and development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also called on them to contribute further to Chinese modernisation by giving full play to their strengths, in a letter to representatives of Hong Kong entrepreneurs with roots in Ningbo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, descendants of Ningbo-born Hong Kong entrepreneurs wrote to Xi to report on their efforts to support national development and express their commitment to the country's modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the reply letter, the president spoke highly of their tradition of patriotism and contributions to the development of their hometown and the country through active engagement in innovation and entrepreneurship and donations to education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Efforts to build a great country and move towards national rejuvenation on all fronts through Chinese modernisation requires the concerted efforts of all Chinese people, Xi added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee thanked President Xi for his response to the entrepreneurs, saying that Xi's letter encourages them to contribute to national development. (Reporting by Xinhua)

    Early screening urged to reduce pre-eclampsia risk

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers from Chinese University on Thursday called for the implementation of a proactive screening and prevention strategy to tackle the serious pregnancy complication pre-eclampsia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pre-eclampsia, a condition that typically manifests after 20 weeks of pregnancy, is characterised by high blood pressure, elevated urine protein levels indicating kidney damage, and other signs of organ dysfunction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said pregnant women should be screened for pre-eclampsia, with those at risk given low-doses of aspirin as a preventative measure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said their recommendation follows a study conducted with partners across Asia which showed the effectiveness of such a preventative approach, with the practice already established in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study showed that the strategy can significantly cut the incidence of pre-eclampsia by between 41 and 54 percent, as well as reducing premature births and perinatal deaths by more than 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liona Poon, professor of obstetrics at the university, highlighted the critical nature of the condition, saying it poses a serious threat to both mother and baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the worst case scenario, the woman can present with seizures and this is what we are very worried about... It's a life-threatening condition for herself as well as her unborn child," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So why do we recommend early screening? It's because there is strong evidence suggesting that there is a way of preventing pre-eclampsia and that is giving high-risk women aspirin. Aspirin should be started before 16 weeks of gestation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university's study involved nearly 43,000 pregnant women in Hong Kong and nine other places in Asia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said Vietnam's rapid economic growth offers lucrative business opportunities for Hong Kong enterprises.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee's comment came as Hong Kong signed eight memoranda of understanding with Vietnam, covering areas such as aviation development, investment and commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the day, the CE met Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Luu Quang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During their discussions, Lee said that Hong Kong serves as an ideal hub for Vietnam to expand its presence in overseas markets, being as it offers exceptional financial, legal and professional services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Tran said the talks focused on strengthening trade and cooperation between the two places, noting Hong Kong's substantial investments in Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the afternoon, Lee met Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam Xiong Bo at the embassy in Hanoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xiong said the SAR has transitioned from stability to prosperity, under Lee's leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ambassador also affirmed the central government's support for Hong Kong's Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) bid, as well as its participation in Sino-Asean cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE's visit to Vietnam is the final leg of a six-day trip in Southeast Asia.

    HK green group urges action on coral bleaching

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 WWF-Hong Kong on Thursday urged the government to designate 30 percent of the SAR's waters as marine protected areas by 2030.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call comes after the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department received reports of coral bleaching in Hong Kong waters last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bleaching strips coral of its main source of energy, and the coral's demise weakens the overall ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelvin So, WWF-Hong Kong's Oceans Conservation Manager, said the main cause of bleaching is a rise in water temperature. It can also be caused by heavy rainfall, which carries sediments from land that can degrade water quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So urged the government to collaborate with universities to study coral bleaching in Hong Kong's waters and to take step to better protect them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to identify and designate ecologically sensitive area for corals such as Sharp Island and Shelter Island in Sai Kung, and establish legally binding regulations to protect these critical areas from human activities," he said.

    New rules on feeding wild animals take effect

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ban on feeding wild animals now also covers feral pigeons. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764231_1_20240801132929.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An amendment to Hong Kong's wildlife protection law took effect on Thursday, with lawmakers urging the authorities to make sure tourists are aware of rules banning the feeding of wild animals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the changes approved by Legco in May, the maximum penalty for feeding wild animals has been raised to a one-year prison term and a fine of HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Offenders may be hit with a fixed penalty of HK$5,000, with the ban now also covering the feeding of feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers, district councillors and officials, including Undersecretary for Environment and Ecology Diane Wong and Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Mickey Lai, went to Tseung Kwan O on Thursday to publicise the new rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters afterwards, DAB lawmaker Stanley Li said he is concerned that tourists will not be aware of the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because they may be permitted to feed feral pigeons in the countries or places they come from. But this is banned in Hong Kong. As I mentioned in the bills committee, the government needs to enhance promotion and place clear signs at border points,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also noted that appointed officers from certain government departments, and not just the police and Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), can now enforce the law even in private venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the authorities to provide training to these departments to avoid disputes or confusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sai Kung district councillor Angel Chong said she believes the new measures have a deterrent effect and will effectively reduce the number of pigeons in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The feeding of pigeons caused a lot of environmental issues back here and a lot of people actually fed them back then, but then we couldn't prosecute them,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But now feeding wild animals and especially pigeons is illegal. I think that actually reduces the incentive of feeding pigeons a lot because now they'd be afraid of being fined. So I think the environmental and health issues caused by feeding pigeons will improve.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AFCD said that for a month, verbal warnings will be given before enforcement action, to allow people to adapt to the new rules.

  Kong said she was moved by the show of support from the many fans who gathered for her arrival at Hong Kong airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong's home. It's so good to be home. And being in Paris, I love the French people, with my French friend in the finals. But they had a huge crowd supporting her, and coming back it feels like I have my crowd too,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she had missed her father and wanted to meet up with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about her future plans, she said she was still savouring her victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It still feels unreal. It still feels like I have to go train, but I don't have to today, so I think I'm going to try and let this sink in and then decide what's next.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong also paid tribute to SAR athletes of previous generations, saying they achieved remarkable results with far fewer resources, paving the way for the current crop to pursue their dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she plans to use some of her HK$6 million prize money to buy gifts for her team and coach, adding that she would like to set up a fund to help provide fencing equipment for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said her aim is not only to promote fencing, but also to inspire others to discover and pursue their own passions in athletics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) called for community support for breastfeeding mothers as World Breastfeeding Awareness Week began on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leung Wing-cheong, a consultant obstetrician at Kwong Wah Hospital, said the authority has introduced various initiatives to promote breastfeeding, including lactation consultant clinics to address the concerns of mothers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said additional support includes antenatal education programmes and a dedicated helpline to assist women with breastfeeding challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that an important step forward will be the establishment of a breast milk bank, which is expected to be operational in the first quarter of next year. The bank is expected to collect 1,000 litres of breast milk per year, benefiting up to 600 premature babies, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said that breast milk is the most natural food for babies, highlighting the long-term benefits of breastfeeding in reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems in babies, as well as promoting neurological development in infants. He added that it also helps recovery after pregnancy and reduces the risk of breast cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that successful breastfeeding is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will be ideal if they have enough support from their partner, husband, in-laws, parents etc. I think successful breastfeeding is indeed teamwork, not just the mother on her own," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday rejected accusations in a Forbes Magazine article that suggested that Hong Kong was being used as a hub by "rogue regimes" to conduct "illicit financial transactions and evade international sanctions."
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government hit out at the Forbes commentary, claiming it cited "false and unfounded narratives" from an anti-China group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the SAR is part of China and that UN Security Council sanctions had always been imposed in full.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without naming names, it said certain countries might impose unilateral sanctions against some places on the basis of their own considerations but that the SAR government did not have the legal authority to implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said thanks to local law enforcement agencies, a number of suspected Hong Kong-registered companies had been struck off, and suspicious vessels had been denied entry into Hong Kong waters as part of its robust system to implement sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council.

    SAR fencers aim even higher after Paris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cedric Ho recalls having doubts about his career. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764124_2_20240731231321.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencers Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho said they're aiming higher after making their Olympic debuts in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both hope to continue to shine in the sport thanks to the spirit of never giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan bowed out of the women’s foil individual event after she was beaten by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16. Still, it's the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old recalled enjoying every moment on the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I was just focusing on the skills or tactics, what I want to do and just try my very best to score. And even though I know at the very end the gap was quite big, I didn't give up. Actually in my mind, I just want to try all my stuff and I just want to do my best," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said fellow fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung’s triumphs motivated her and other young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was amazing because my competition day was in the middle. So like before my competition day I saw Vivian got the gold medal… They brought home two gold medals which is never easy, and I think a lot of citizens will know fencing this sport and I think more and more kids will be joining this sport as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a part-time fencer who’s studying in the United States, Chan said it was difficult to juggle between fencing and her studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she made it clear she didn’t want to give up the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho, meanwhile, recalled being at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The idea of giving up came up most when I was at my lowest point, which was about two or three years after the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers. I was a bit down and confused and kind of wanted to give up, but luckily I got through in the end,” the 28-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho is the first male épéeist from the SAR to qualify for the Olympics in 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to Japan's Masaru Yamada in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This proves that we have worked very hard in the men's épée category for the past 12 years. The success of our men's épée is due to the whole team and the coaches working together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said he's proud of Ho’s performance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel that he has a lot of takeaways. He's seen his potential, his strengths, and he also has seen his room for improvement. And I hope that we can keep on growing together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu added he's confident that fencing will continue to develop in Hong Kong because of government support and infrastructure being put in place.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet were the last shuttlers from Hong Kong to bow out of the Paris Olympics, as they shared an emotional moment following defeat in the mixed doubles quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The long-time partners on the court were brushed aside in straight games by the third-seeded pair of Chae Yu-jung and Seo Seung-jae.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans needed just 39 minutes to finish off the SAR duo, winning 21-15, 21-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang and Tse went down by as much as 9-16 in the opening game, before taking five of the next seven points to go within 14-18. They never got closer than that, however, and the Koreans hung on to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chae and Seo then asserted control of game two with an 8-1 run, and never relinquished the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Tang and Tse had trouble holding back tears while meeting the press afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse, who said she's grateful just to compete in Paris, revealed for the first time that she was in a hospital emergency ward two or three weeks ago but did not specify the reason.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Perhaps in the past month, I've cried every single day while on the court. Jordan withstood a lot from me," Tse said as she briefly lost her composure in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I couldn't even squeeze a toothpaste... or comb my hair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also heaped praise on Tang, saying without him she might have retired a long time ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, for his part, thanked Tse for not giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also picked up bumps and bruises here and there so I understand how difficult it is... Returning to a high level after injury is never easy, yet she's done it many times."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added they've been under immense pressure in the past year or so punching their Paris tickets, as they had trailed so much in the rankings.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey snagged another bronze medal on Thursday in the women’s 100 metres freestyle event in Paris, making her the first Hongkonger to clinch four Olympic medals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey stayed around the front of the pack throughout the first 50 metres, and was able to pull herself into second place behind the fast-starting American Torri Huske at the turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pushed through the last 50 metres and was in contention thoughout to grab a spot on the podium with a time of 52.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s world record holder Sarah Sjoestroem surged through to claim the gold with a time of 52.16 seconds, while Huske was 0.13 seconds back to pip Haughey for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters that she knew it would be a highly competitive race, so she just wanted to focus on enjoying the whole process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that my training for this race in the past few years was more intense compared to the Tokyo Olympics. I practised a lot more in terms of training time, number of minutes, and distance. Especially as you get older, your body recovery is getting worse," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Children watching TV, everyone needs to add oil (keep going). The whole journey may not be easy, but if you have a dream, just keep chasing it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey earlier won the bronze in the 200 metres freestyle event, as well as two silver medals at the Tokyo Olympics in the same respective events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sjoestroem, who set the world record back in 2017, had only committed to join the 100 metres at the last minute having previously indicated she'd focus on her favoured 50m free.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu concluded his maiden Olympic campaign on Wednesday after losing to old rival Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei in their group stage finale.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was sent packing after 12th-seeded Chou wrapped up a 21-18, 21-13 victory in 44 minutes to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 17 Lee, who was beaten by Chou in eight of their 12 previous matchups, mostly played catch-up in their latest encounter. The SAR shuttler came back from six points down in the opening game to make it 18-19, before his opponent delivered perfect smashes to take the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chou once again moved in front in the ensuing game with a 12-6 lead, and Lee failed to erase the deficit the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the press after the match, Lee said he felt he could have done better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather up and down emotionally... I give myself too much pressure, I wanted to prove myself to others," he conceded, holding back tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before arriving [in Paris], I told my coaches, this is my only chance to prove to the world who Lee Cheuk-yiu is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to address his weaknesses and consistency issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the La Chapelle Arena in Paris, Chinese Taipei veteran Tai Tzu-ying suffered a shock group stage exit in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three, who bagged silver in Tokyo, was stunned by Ratchanok Intanon from Thailand in straight games, 19-21, 15-21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai, who was battling multiple injuries, burst into tears after the match and shared a warm embrace with her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did my best, based on my condition at this year's Games," a tearful Tai told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I can say that I have tried my best. But of course, speed-wise I was unable to catch up to my opponent."

    Warnings before enforcement over illegal feeding

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ban on illegal feeding will be extended to cover feral pigeons. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764115_1_20240731223353.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said verbal warnings will be given before enforcement action for a month after an amendment to the city’s wildlife protection law takes effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Legislative Council passed the Wild Animals Protection (Amendment) Bill in May, raising the maximum penalty of feeding wild animals to HK$100,000 and a one-year jail term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be a fixed penalty of HK$5,000 for illegal feeding, and the ban will be extended to cover feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new law takes effect on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Wednesday that officers will issue verbal warnings before taking enforcement actions when they find any illegal feeding activity from August 1 to 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Starting from September 1, enforcement officers will take enforcement action immediately without prior verbal warning if any person is found to be illegally feeding feral pigeons or wild animals,” it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the police and AFCD officers, appointed officers from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and Housing Department can also take enforcement action against illegal feeding, the AFCD noted.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group on Wednesday urged the Labour Department to beef up its guidelines on working under hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department issued the "Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work” more than a year ago, outlining the criteria for outdoor workers to take hourly breaks during extreme conditions to prevent heatstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An updated version was issued earlier this year, aligning the department’s warning system to the Hong Kong Observatory's "extremely hot special weather tips".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the document also states that employers or contractors could abolish breaks for workers if certain measures are implemented to prevent heatstroke, such as providing drinking water, cooling vests and portable fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Concern for Grassroots' Livelihood Alliance said 90 percent of 100 cleaners responding to their recent survey said they felt unwell even when preventive measures were in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to social worker Au Yee-wing from the alliance, many cleaners said the guidelines failed to address their needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said, for example, that employees working in extreme hot weather wearing protective suits are granted extra rest time, but those wearing only masks are not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Street cleaners wear masks while working in the hot environment. We suggest the Labour Department review the guidelines, allowing cleaners to increase their rest time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au added that cleaners often have heavy workloads, making it even more difficult for them to take breaks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Jason Ng did not finish the triathlon race which took place under the blazing Paris heat, ending his maiden Olympic journey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng completed the 1,500-metre swim in 24 minutes and 6 seconds, with a transition time of 51 seconds before starting the 40-kilometre bike ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not finish the course and was eliminated before putting on his running shoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Ng said his performance suit's zipper was pulled off during the triathlon competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the midst of the competition, my trisuit was grabbed by someone and the zipper in the back was pulled off," Ng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water kept going into my suit, and it became like a parachute. The entire suit kept pulling me backwards, and it didn't help with the water resistance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Alex Yee pipped New Zealand's Hayden Wilde for an amazing victory in the event. The Tokyo silver medallist showed his pacing mastery of the 10-km run, passing a flagging Wilde with less than 400 metres to go in blazing sunshine and 30 degree Celsius heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been postponed for a day due to the poor water quality of the Seine River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel, a Mexican living in Paris who watched the race along Avenue des Champs-Élysées, said it was worth the wait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m assuming that the people were testing the levels of bacteria. I had heard all of the things they needed to do properly so I’m glad that they did wait and it was well worth the wait. Honestly it was a great race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kristen, a spectator from New Jersey, said she enjoyed watching the race but not the idea of swimming in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I'm glad that the sun was better for them today. I still think it's gross that they had to swim in that [river],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, France's Cassandre Beaugrand won a historic gold in a thrilling women's individual triathlon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland's Julie Derron dug deep to win silver, while Great Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wong Chun-ting of Hong Kong put up a good fight in his round-of-32 men's table tennis singles match at the Paris Olympics, but he was no match for second-seeded Fan Zhendong of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan was off to a fast start, racing to a 2-0 lead by taking the first two games 11-5, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong came to life in the third game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He jumped out to leads of 4-0 and 5-1 before holding on for an 11-9 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fan simply proved too strong for his SAR opponent. He went on to capture the next two games 11-6, 11-3 to complete a 4-1 win in 36 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said after the match that this could well be his last Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Olympics this year is special. For one, I am already 33 years old, so I am considering this Olympics to be my last. Because for the next one, four years later, whether or not I can get the chance to compete is unknown, too much uncertainty," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Zhu Chengzhu on Wednesday bowed out of the women's singles event at the Paris Olympics, losing 0-4 in her round of 32 match against Japan's Miu Hirano.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old kept it close in the first game, losing 13-11, but then lost the next three games, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9, in the match that lasted 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhu is choosing to look ahead, instead focusing on the positives despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy this time, and I enjoyed every game," she said after the match. "I think it’s normal whether I win or lose – there will be a women’s team battle next, so I will prepare well for every game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anything is possible because of this venue. Although I was not feeling as confident today, if I am confident, anything is possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Zhu is next set to compete in the women's team round of 16 next Tuesday, when the Hong Kong, China team take on Sweden at South Paris Arena 4.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official advance estimates released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compares with a revised 2.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed the second quarter growth to an increase in exports and investment spending, saying it expects the economy to continue to expand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year, but performance of the different economic segments may vary amid uncertainties on various fronts," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions, escalating trade conflicts, and US interest rate trajectory remaining not entirely clear may add uncertainties to economic sentiment and activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Natixis Asia Pacific economist Gary Ng said the figure for the second quarter was slightly higher than he expected, but pressures still remain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the other components, such as the contraction in the household spending and also the greater growth in the import of services, which is basically reflecting the outbound tourism and also the rebound in investment, which basically just get back to the pre-Covid level and is still 16 percent lower than 2018 for the same period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think these are all the sorts of pressures that I would see within the economy that can actually drag the growth rate further in the future."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific and HK Express passengers can now use their mobiles to check in baggage at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using the airlines' apps, passengers can get a printed tag at special channels and drop off their luggage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The function is only available to people with electronic travel documents who are flying to places where they don't require a visa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris Au Young, the general manager of data analytics at the Airport Authority, said the new bag drop service will save passengers time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So if we compare that method with the old method, the old method takes two minutes more. If we don't count any time used for lining up, the entire process is shortened from three minutes to only one," he told the media on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au Young said the authority hopes to expand the function so it can be used by 80 percent of passengers leaving Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong University's Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it has developed a medical-grade smartphone stethoscope for early detection of valvular heart disease.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The faculty said the AI-powered software Vitogram has an estimated accuracy of 81 percent for detecting significant valvular disease, a level comparable to a doctor's assessment using a traditional stethoscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it does not replace the function of a doctor, you still need a doctor to perform comprehensive assessment on a patient for proper diagnosis, but our invention provides a very powerful disease screening tool," said Associate Professor Joshua Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vitogram uses AI to measure heart sounds from four parts of the chest, with each measurement taking approximately 10 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho described the tool as an "AI doctor in your pocket" that allows anyone to conveniently assess their own health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university's Dr. Wong Chun-Ka said Vitogram is among the first software able to record and analyse heart sounds, as opposed to just a person's heart rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are able to detect structural diseases like valve disease, which is not possible using previous commercially available devices," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university is hoping that Vitogram will be available on the market in the next six months to a year and is looking to partner with healthcare organisations in places including Singapore and Malaysia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said Hong Kong will sign 13 agreements with Cambodia to boost trade and investment between the two places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Deputy Prime Minister Sar Sokha, Lee said Hong Kong will enhance collaboration with Cambodia across various sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The collaboration between Cambodia and Hong Kong will be closer than ever before. I'm confident we will work to further strengthen cooperation between the two governments, promote commerce, tourism, and cultural exchanges, strengthen people-to-people ties and jointly contribute to the development of the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said that the Trade Development Council will set up an office in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to promote business ties between the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that he and Cambodian officials have discussed easing visa and travel rules to promote tourism in both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Cambodia for supporting Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

    New taxi fleets to hit the streets within a year

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The firms have a year to complete their preparations and will operate a total of 3,500 cabs. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764032_1_20240731131941.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five new taxi fleets are expected to hit the streets within a year after beating several other applicants to win licences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities on Wednesday said they received 15 applications in total, but three did not meet the requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the chosen fleets, three will operate only urban taxis, while the other two will cover urban areas as well as the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms have a year to complete their preparations and will operate a total of 3,500 cabs, accounting for a fifth of the taxis in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said fleet operators will provide training for drivers and monitor their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said they have to offer a number of electronic payment methods as well as online car-hailing services with no cap on booking fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Individual applicants may engage different partners for developing the online platform for them. There will be quite a room for development, taking into account their own market strategies and the clientele they are targeting. We do not stipulate the hard-and-fast rule on how the online services will have to be done," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For trips booked in advance, we will allow the flexibility for the taxi drivers to charge at a pre-agreed rate, or to charge according to the meter, plus an additional amount as the pre-booking fees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers will be able to rate their taxi drivers with a complaint mechanism in place, the transport official said, adding that serious breaches could result in the termination of licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said car parks in Tsing Yi and Tai Po are in the pipeline for the taxis, and the authorities will look into whether to expand the scheme to grant more licences in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the fleet operators, Sino Development, said it will operate taxis across the city, including on Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to make good use of our resources and operate all 1,000 taxis to provide quality services to citizens," said fleet operations manager Wong Tai-hoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For full-time cabbies, we will need 2,000 of them, on top of 1,000 part-time, substitute drivers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung from another operator, Big Boss Taxi Company, said the group already has a number of taxis in line with the requirement that vehicles in the fleets must not be more than three years old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Coming from the taxi industry, we already have on hand almost 200 taxis. They are ready to be deployed anytime. But we do want to have a more diverse fleet, which includes the premium taxis as well as the ones for wheelchairs," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Likely we will do a soft launch at the end of this year, maybe perhaps early next year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fleet operator SynCab Service, for its part, said it will bring in over 120 new cabs before the end of the year, including six-seater, electric taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said reserving a journey in a six-seater is expected to cost 10 to 25 percent more than a taxi meter charge.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign business leaders on Wednesday said a new permit is providing easier access to the mainland, as the first batch of non-Chinese permanent residents in Hong Kong received their travel cards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Permit holders can travel to the mainland within the five-year validity period, with each stay not exceeding 90 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce, Dato' Gan Khai Choon, was among those collecting their permits at a China Travel Service centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we wanted to go to mainland China, in the early days, we had to apply for a visa like everybody else. But for Malaysians ourselves, we also needed to apply for permission from our Malaysian government to have a permit to go into China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When China and Malaysia had a better relationship, we could apply independently without the Malaysian approval. But even at that time, to apply for a visa, it was quite difficult because the process and passport requirements were quite cumbersome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the application process for the new permit was smooth with the application centre offering him a "first-class service", and that he's planning to travel to the mainland in the coming few weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former committee member of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, Alfred Buchner, received his permit after filing an application around three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hasn't travelled to the mainland for seven years, because he wanted to avoid the hassle of going through the visa application process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are a lot of suppliers which I see in China, where I have contact in China, so far only by email... With this travel permit, it's a big encouragement to visit China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buchner, who picked up his permit along with his family, said he would first travel to Shenzhen for a weekend trip.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), Vincent Cheng, on Wednesday called on the government to provide more details about proposed new sports facilities, saying Hong Kong currently needs more venues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Cheng noted that proposals for new sports facilities, such as a fencing area and swimming pools, were put forward in the past two chief executive policy addresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't see the government earmarking any land or a firm timetable for when construction will be completed. It takes time to build such facilities and I hope the authorities will announce a timetable as soon as possible," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said new HKSI facilities will be completed by the end of the year, but they will not provide a significant increase in space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China Table Tennis Association coach Yeung Ping-chiu echoed Cheng's remarks, saying a lack of facilities poses a major challenge for various sports.

    Wong Ka-lee tells judokas Olympics not a pipe dream

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wong Ka-lee says she wants to show young judokas that it's possible to reach the Olympics. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763678_1_20240731090156.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Olympian Wong Ka-lee said she hopes her journey to Paris will inspire other young judokas to pursue their dreams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was the third judoka ever from Hong Kong to qualify for the Olympics, marking the return of a local judoka to the Games after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was eliminated in the women’s under 48kg competition by Austrian Katharina Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Wong believes her presence in the Olympics would show others that they too can make it to the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Younger [athletes] may think the Olympics are out of reach. But going to the Olympics this time can show them that it’s not. They can all do it,” she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete said her judo journey is far from over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics are a good experience. I see that I have obviously improved this year in terms of throwing techniques. I hope I can perform better in the next competition,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-time Olympian said she will stay in Paris to watch the matches of top judokas and visit wineries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said she will continue to sharpen her skills, and her next goal is the Asian Judo Open Hong Kong which starts in November.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu made a winning start in his maiden Olympic appearance, beating Mexico's Luis Ramon Garrido in the group stage of the men's singles tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee, the world number 17 who missed out on a spot for the Tokyo Games in 2021, overpowered his opponent 21-5 in the first game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 66th-ranked Garrido, who was also making his Olympic debut in Paris, took the ensuing game 21-15 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair exchanged leads in a nail-biting finale, but Lee eventually came out on top after pulling away late on to win 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top men's shuttler from the SAR next faces Chou Tien-chien of Chinese Taipei Wednesday evening, Hong Kong time. The winner of that match will advance to the round of 16, as Chou had already beaten Garrido earlier in their group tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a different story for another local badminton player, Happy Lo, who ended her Olympic journey after losing her second straight group match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supanida Katethong of Thailand beat Lo 21-14, 21-9.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Edgar Cheung's win over Fillippo Macchi has sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian fans. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763930_1_20240730221521.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China said it respects the decision of the referees in a controversy involving fencer Edgar Cheung's win over his Italian opponent in the individual foil final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The Olympic Games are the highest-level events in the world. As always, the SF&OC and athletes adhere to and firmly believe in the Olympic spirit, respecting all game results and referee decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian Fencing Federation earlier lodged a complaint against what it called “unacceptable refereeing decisions” in Cheung's 15-14 win over Fillippo Macchi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President of the federation, Paolo Azzi, said he was disappointed with the conclusion the match, adding that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been robbed of the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were two occasions where both fencers landed their touches, but the referees from Chinese Taipei and South Korea ruled that no point should be awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macchi wrote in his Instagram post that he didn’t want to blame the referees for his defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that for sure the refereeing could have been better. It's impossible to not call three touches but at the end of the day that's the nature of the competition," Nicola Lu, epee coach of SAR fencer Cedric Ho, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have external factors that we cannot control and we can only focus on doing our best and focusing on our own actions,” Lu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case also sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian netizens on the social media platforms of the two fencers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, felt it was unlikely that Cheung will be stripped of his gold due to Italy's appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don’t think it will affect [the result] because the referees were very careful. They made the judgement after watching video replays many times. Even when you ask [other] people to review the play, it will still be the same result," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that the referees must decide responsibly when it’s hard to tell who wins or loses, adding that it’s normal for people to have different interpretations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting fought hard in the bronze-medal match of the mixed doubles table tennis event at the Paris Olympics, but they weren’t able to make it to the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team on Tuesday lost 0-4 to South Korea’s Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon in a match lasting 39 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean pair were off to a quick start, winning the first game 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then raced to a 3-0 lead, taking the second and third games 11-7, 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong pushed hard to catch up in a nail-biting fourth game, but it eventually went to Shin and Lim, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although we missed the medal by a small margin, the fact that we got into the top four this time is already a big breakthrough," Doo said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because actually there were a lot of teams before whose ability were better or similar to ours. Including the semi-finals, we really did keep trying to become better. Even though the ending was not the best, we did try our best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the defeat, it's the best finish for Hong Kong in mixed doubles table tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it's a bit of a pity, especially since we had a chance to get a medal both today and yesterday," Wong said. "Although we are not very satisfied with our performance today, we were already thinking hard and communicating with each other about any strategy we can have before the match."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimmer Ian Ho has been eliminated from the men’s 100m freestyle event on Tuesday at the Olympic Games, finishing 55th overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is competing for the second time at the Games, finished sixth in his heat with a time of 51.46 seconds, 2.62 seconds behind the heat 5 winner Lamar Taylor of the Bahamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's definitely a different experience, but it's a little more familiar, so I'm glad I can be here again,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself. Swimming is a sport where you can focus on yourself and do the best race that you can, and that's what I've tried to do over the past couple of days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Alexy of the United States led all 79 swimmers with a time of 47.57 seconds.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have failed to advance in the women's doubles in badminton at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their final group match on Tuesday, the SAR duo lost to Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first game was a closely fought affair before the No 4 seed from China prevailed, 21-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second game was also close with the score tied several times early on, before Liu and Tan put on a late charge to come away 21-15 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did well because we didn't fear them for their ranking. Even when we were trailing by many points during the match, we absolutely didn't give up and we tried to fight point by point," Lianne Yeung said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair finished in third place in Group B with one win and two losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the group and Bulgaria came second, both advancing to the next round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun's hopes of capturing a medal at the Paris Olympics came to an end on Tuesday, after he finished last among six competitors in the first quarter-final of the men's rowing single sculls event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clocked in a time of seven minutes 13.7 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew I was competing against seeded players in the quarter-finals, so I tried to catch up with them in the first 500 metres," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it would be challenging, but I didn't want to give up. The process was difficult and I had only myself, from preparing for the match to drawing up a race plan."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will row again in the C and D semi-finals on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese diplomat in Cambodia has hailed a visit by a Hong Kong delegation to the Southeast Asian country as a boost to bilateral cooperation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Wenbin, the Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, on Tuesday met Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived in the capital Phnom Penh as part of a six-day visit to three nations that also includes Laos and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the meeting, Wang noted that he had earlier sent off another delegation led by former chief executive and vice-chairman of the nation's top political advisory body, CY Leung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With Lee and Leung visiting at the same time, this shows that Hong Kong attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperation with Cambodia and promoting China-Cambodia relations," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The chief executive's visit will certainly promote mutually beneficial cooperation between Cambodia and Hong Kong, and play a role in further boosting China-Cambodia relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE, for his part, stressed the importance of fostering ties between governments, and allowing companies to do business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of his departure to Cambodia from Laos, Lee congratulated and praised fencer Edgar Cheung and swimmer Siobhan Haughey for their outstanding performances at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said their performances showed the excellence of Hong Kong's athletes, while reiterating the government's commitment to sports development.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Foreign Ministry's Office in Hong Kong said respect is key to developing sound relationships between the SAR and foreign governments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Commissioner Cui Jianchun on Tuesday said sanctions imposed by the West on the territory disrespect the city's authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to build a good, sound relationship, we have to respect each other. That means every country has to respect the Hong Kong SAR government. And whatever things happen, you cannot use your national law to become a long-arm jurisdiction to impose sanctions to other nations, to other individual companies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui said none of the consuls-general he's met in Hong Kong were against the city having its national security laws, and that a majority of them supported the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commissioner also urged foreign governments to support Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui said he hopes he could work with the SAR administration during his tenure on the accession bid, as the move would be conducive to the city's development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the recent visit to China by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, where he discussed the war with Russia with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and met Chief Executive John Lee in Hong Kong, the commissioner said the SAR government is sticking to international law and international norms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong SAR government, Hong Kong people love to support the peaceful dialogue, peaceful communication as quickly as possible... and to relieve, also to alleviate, to reduce the suffering of the people and to try to do good things for the international community," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui, a former ambassador, was appointed to the office in April this year, filling the post after his predecessor Liu Guangyuan was named a deputy director of the liaison office.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Tramways is celebrating its 120th anniversary, saying it aims to continue to contribute to the public transport system, attract more tourists and remain meaningful to locals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trams transport around 150,000 passengers daily, representing over 10 percent of the Hong Kong Island population and making it one of the busiest tram networks in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Managing Director of Hong Kong Tramways Paul Tirvaudey on Tuesday said the company seeks to balance modernisation of the system with preserving its identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our point is not to insert a modern tram... it is to insert modern components into the tram to keep the appearance while making a more modern system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said passenger numbers are gradually recovering post-Covid, but they are still down 10-15 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a celebration ceremony, Tirvaudey emphasised the firm's commitment to sustainability, saying it is building trams that are 30 percent more energy efficient, reusing old parts for new trams to create a circular economy, and conducting carbon footprint assessments to identify areas for improvement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are green. We are among the best in the class, but we work to be even better in the future," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey's success in the water has inspired many of the SAR's young people to take up the sport, but there simply aren't enough public pools to go around, according to one expert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Swimming Teachers' Association, Li Chi-leung, told an RTHK programme on Tuesday that a lack of swimming pools means many grassroots children are unable to participate in the sport because it's out of their families' financial reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Parents want their children to learn look for swimming classes in the community, most of which are set up by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. But the department doesn't offer many classes, and during the winter there are very few classes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they sign up for private classes, it's very expensive to book a pool and private classes do have to make a profit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the government should build more indoor pools and keep them open all year round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey won bronze in the women's 200m freestyle final in Paris, becoming the first Hong Kong athlete to win three Olympic medals following her two at the Tokyo Games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king Edgar Cheung defended his Olympic gold medal in men's foil in dramatic fashion after making a brilliant comeback in the final match against Italian Filippo Macchi in the early hours of Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian pulled ahead 14-12, but Cheung immediately gained two points to bring the game into a tie-breaker for the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the score tied at 14-14, the fencing got even more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On two occasions, both fencers thought they had won the last point, but the judges said it was too close to rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After three attempts to break the tie, Cheung took home the win for Hong Kong, China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he couldn't believe he's the first athlete to repeat in men's foil in 68 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe [that I've won]...and being the first man to repeat in so long, actually, I really rather can't believe it," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of the best moments in my life. To have a gold medal in France, with a French coach, for me it's a wonderful day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he woke up not feeling too good, but when he fenced, it was different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said coach Greg Koenig told him not to focus on the judges' decisions late in the game, and focus on the next move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach, for his part, said he never doubted that Cheung could overcome his deficit at 12-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three last points, to be honest, I know he can do it. I will stay positive. I will send him my maximum positive energy because I know, three points in a row for him is absolutely nothing," Koenig said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory helped him claim his second gold in as many Games and becomes the first athlete from the SAR to grab consecutive Olympic titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong now has two gold medals in Paris, both in fencing, the most ever won at a single Games so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, the Italian Fencing Federation has lodged an official complaint with the International Fencing Federation and the International Olympic Committee over what it considers to be unacceptable refereeing decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation President Paolo Azzi expressed his disappointment at the conclusion of the competition, claiming that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been unfairly denied the gold medal he deserved.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey won a consecutive medal in the women's 200m freestyle, earning bronze on top of the silver she won in Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong star was among the first to turn at the half-way point before her Australian rivals Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus turned up the heat in the second 100 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Callaghan pulled away from Titmus and Haughey in the last lap to win in an Olympic record time of 1 minute, 53.27 seconds, 0.54 seconds ahead of defending champion Titmus who settled for silver while Haughey picked up the bronze in a time of 1 minute, 54.55.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said after the race that her time wasn't as good as she thought it would be, but she's still satisfied with the result, saying the Australian swimmers were really strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said it was a special moment for her because when she won silvers in Tokyo, there were no spectators because of Covid, and she's glad that her parents were among many in the crowd cheering her on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star swimmer also thanked Hongkongers for staying up to support her and other SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you so much for everyone who's been waking up really early to watch our races, our matches and competitions," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really been on social media a lot these past few days, but I've received everyone's messages and all the love and support, so, thank you so much and please keep supporting us because it means the world to us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Haughey's third Olympic medal following the two silvers she won in the 100m and 200m freestyle events at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is due to compete in the women's 100m free on Tuesday.
