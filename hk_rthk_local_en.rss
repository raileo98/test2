 Local airline Hong Kong Express has issued a statement saying that due to the global Microsoft system outage, the system services of Navitaire, their service provider, have yet to be restored.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It goes on to say that HK Express regrets to announce the cancellation of some 24 of its flights originally scheduled for 20 July. Passengers can check which flights are affected via a link on the special announcement on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline is urging passengers whose flights have been cancelled not to go to the airport, but to make sure their contact information on the "Manage My Booking" app is up to date and to check their email regularly for the latest flight arrangements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it is highly concerned about a large-scale IT outage involving Microsoft systems, saying officials will keep a close watch on developments and prepare to react accordingly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the Deputy Chief Secretary will be responsible for monitoring the situation, adding that the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has been in touch with Microsoft, urging it to assist affected companies, and come up with remedial measures as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said government systems are running normally for the time being, and that the Airport Authority has triggered an emergency response mechanism to minimise disruptions to passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Productivity Council’s Computer Emergency Response Team (HKCERT), meanwhile, called on people to back up their important data to prevent information loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It advised organisations to enable offline access for applications and documents as well to minimise interruptions to everyday operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The response team also reminded firms to come up with contingency plans in case similar incidents happen again.

    HK airport hit by global IT outage

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) on Friday said contingency measures are in place after a number of airlines were affected by a global outage involving Microsoft systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the disruption affected five airlines, including Hong Kong Express, adding that these carriers had to switch to manual check-in, which was more time consuming and resulted in the delay of around a dozen flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dicky, a tourist from Thailand, said he had arrived at the airport hours before his flight but couldn't check into his HK Express flight to Bangkok
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I am not in a hurry today, so I still can wait, but I am not sure for some people... If someone is in a hurry, then there definitely will be a delay. I mean, if I cannot check in now, it means maybe the flight will be delayed because they just say, please wait a moment, and then when the time has come, they will call us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another traveller, surnamed Li, said his flight to the Thai capital was postponed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our travel plans will be slightly affected, for example the hotel arrangements, transportation and other issues. They might affect our itinerary. My kid may fall asleep very late tonight after arriving there. In such situations, we can only wait. There are no alternatives apart from waiting. I hope that the system will recover soon," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA said it has deployed additional staff to assist affected passengers, and that it is in close communication with airline operators to address the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said its computer system has been functioning normally despite the global outage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said it will ensure that the operations of public hospitals will continue as normal, and that it will closely monitor the situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has partnered with its third tech company, Galbot, to further develop the city's AI sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company makes a humanoid robot, also named Galbot, which can complete basic household chores, such as hanging clothes, opening and closing drawers and pouring drinks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He Wang, director of the PKU-Galbot Lab of Embodied AI, explained what the partnership with HKIC means for the development of AI in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Leveraging Hong Kong’s strong market resources, abundant talent pool, and broad international insights, we look forward to curating attention and building credibility in domestic and international markets. Concurrently, we will bring Hong Kong the most cutting-edge embodied AI technology and cultivate top-tier talent with multi-disciplinary capabilities,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The partnership is also aimed at opening up more avenues for discussion surrounding AI for the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 30 secondary school students were invited to a launch ceremony on Friday, to engage in dialogue with forum guests and interact with Galbot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We look forward to doing more with Galbot in terms of cultivating our young talent,” said Clara Chan, CEO of HKIC.

    'Whale likely died of propeller-induced injuries'

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762308_1_20240719163947.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A baleen whale found dead off Sai Kung last year was killed by back and spine injuries that were likely caused by propellers of a “fast-moving vessel”, authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said they could not determine what type of vessel had hit the mammal, but ruled out the possibility it was a whale-watching or fishing boat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sightings of the juvenile Bryde’s whale had led to people going out in boats to try to get a glimpse of it, and officials urged against any chases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An expert from Spain consulted on the matter narrowed down the time of the whale's death to between the evening of July 30 and the early hours of the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A necropsy also found two fresher wounds on the whale, including one near its blowhole and the other near the dorsal fin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It can be concluded that the cause of death of this Bryde’s whale was a fatal boat strike,” the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The individual may have become separated from its mother or lost her, depriving it of maternal care and guidance. As a result, it was exposed to an unfavourable environment and local dangers.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Leung, who chairs an expert group on the conservation of marine mammals, said the boat involved was likely a dual propeller vessel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But officials said no whale-watching activity was detected during the four days prior to the mammal’s death, and that fishing vessels generally do not travel at such high speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We cannot tell what kind of vessel it was, and also we cannot tell the size of the vessel,” said AFCD director Mickey Lai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But the only thing we know…the vessel striking the whale should be travelling at a very high speed. We are talking about over 10 knots or even faster. But for the exact speed, we can’t tell.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten knots is roughly equivalent to 18.5 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said officials will look into amending laws to designate temporary restriction areas more quickly, and banning whale-watching activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If the legislation can give us more power in imposing more control within the restriction area, and give us more flexibility, and also give us more power to designate this area in a shorter period of time, it can really help us to protect the whale within a really short period of time,” Lai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are talking about emergency situations, and everything has to be done within a very short period of time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration aims to put forward concrete proposals to the expert group in the third quarter of this year the earliest.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority (HA) on Friday announced new rules that punish public housing tenants for feeding feral pigeons or hanging objects from their windows.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HA, tenants will receive seven penalty points for "feeding feral pigeons or other wild animals".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tenants will also be slapped with seven penalty points for "hanging or placing objects with potential risk of falling from height outside the window, balcony or façade".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, residents are restricted from placing objects in corridors or staircases only.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, tenants will receive 15 penalty points if they resist or obstruct the HA or its authorised personnel in carrying out their duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any household that accumulates 16 points within a two-year period faces eviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new measures will take effect in the fourth quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enhanced measures aim to provide a clean, hygienic and safe living environment for public rental housing (PRH) residents and strengthen the effectiveness of enforcement," an HA spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that the HA will step up promotion before the new regulations come into force.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Cruise & Yacht Industry Association announced on Friday that it has relocated to Singapore, saying it's following the lead of international cruise ships.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association said it made the move this month after taking into account operating costs and that a lot of international operators have switched their focus to the city state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's chief executive, Kara Yeung, said other cities did more than Hong Kong to support the sector's recovery after the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong was relatively lacking behind," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only a few cruises came to the region this summer, and none of them call the SAR as their home port."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said Hong Kong has been promoting the recovery of the cruise industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said cruise ship arrivals this year have returned to pre-Covid levels, and it is working hard to increase the number of ship calls.

    Govt urged to offer shopkeepers rent cuts

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New People's Party on Friday called for a reduction in rents for retailers operating from government premises, to help them cope with a citywide slump in sales.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party said it recently sent questionnaires to more than 400 stores across the city, with shopkeepers reporting a drop in customer numbers and an increase in store vacancies, particularly in Northern District and Tai Po.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five percent of the shops said their rent had gone up after the pandemic, while almost 60 percent said they had seen a fall in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent official figures showed retail spending in May was down 11 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party noted that many people are heading to Shenzhen at the weekend to make cheaper purchases, urging the government to help alleviate the pressure on local retailers with rent cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also suggested the government should come up with area-specific promotions to help all 18 districts in the city attract visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't believe that [Hong Kong] has lost the market competition. We can have different promotion techniques for the government to promote together with the districts other than doing the same thing in all 18 districts," said the party's vice-chairwoman Eunice Yung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that rather than focusing on special days, tourism promotions should be expanded to ensure a constant stream of visitors.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public housing tenants will soon see rents increase by 10 percent, after a committee under the Housing Authority backed the move.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The higher rents will take effect in October, but the authority has agreed to a three-month exemption period for most tenants, meaning they will not have to pay any extra before January 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairperson of the authority's subsidised housing committee, Cleresa Wong, on Friday said the waiver takes into account factors such as the impact on tenants and the authority's finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although there is a waiver, the Housing Authority will have a huge burden in the coming years. We have a massive housing development plan and the economy is also not very good, so we need to be prudent in our financial management," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regarding this exemption, the authority has tried its best and gritted our teeth to offer this waiver. We hope that members of the public and tenants will understand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rent adjustment will see an average increase of HK$230. Wong said none of the committee members had an issue with the 10 percent increase, and that she believed it is an amount that residents can afford.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent. Between 2012 and 2018, there was a 10 percent increase following every rental review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said the mechanism, which takes into account tenants' income, has been effective, and that now is not a suitable time to review the system given the current economic situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also dismissed suggestions that rents should be reviewed annually or that the rate of inflation should be taken into account.

 Several people were injured when a taxi hit a road barrier and flipped over on Kwai Chung Road on Friday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The driver and his passenger were taken to hospital for treatment, as were two passengers on a passing KMB bus that was struck by debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online photos showed two windows on the lower deck of the route 290 bus were damaged.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said it strongly condemns and opposes US politicians' remarks criticising the SAR's homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after a congressional committee and commission both wrote to the US government, demanding it impose sanctions on SAR officials, judges, prosecutors and police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the letter made slandering remarks and despicable threats against relevant personnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR government said the so-called sanctions mentioned in the letter were a "despicable political manipulation to intimidate officials", and amounted to gross interference in the affairs of Hong Kong and the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement said safeguarding national security was an inherent right of all sovereign states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the US had at least 21 pieces of legislation safeguarding national security and was in no position to point its finger at Hong Kong for doing the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also defended a recent national security trial against 47 people, saying the conviction of 45 of them over a conspiracy offence showed the scale and the seriousness of the criminal scheme.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they seized 31 kilos of suspected methamphetamine and five kilos of suspected cocaine in seven drug trafficking cases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The haul had a market value of about HK$20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said for six of the cases, drug traffickers were trying to hide the suspected narcotics in co-working spaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said drug traffickers would ship packages declared as chairs and children's toys from the United States and send them to different shared office spaces in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man, aged 38, suspected of receiving the shipment was arrested in Wong Chuk Hang on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, officers arrested a 23-year-old passenger from Kuala Lumpur at the airport on Wednesday. He was found carrying suspected methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two arrested men have both been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's representatives to the country's political bodies submitted their suggestions for the Policy Address to Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday, focusing on patriotic education and economic development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the submission, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), Starry Lee, said it is the right time to put forward patriotic education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is the right time to do so. First of all, our country [has] our own policy and legislation to govern that. Hong Kong, as part of the country, [we are obligated] to do that. We understand...it will further make 'One Country, Two Systems' a more effective system for our own country," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dennis Lam, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), urged the government to use Hong Kong's private healthcare services to attract mainlanders to the city, as more Hongkongers are seeking medical care on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bank of East Asia's Co-CEO Brian Li, who is a local delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the government should bolster the SAR's status as an offshore renminbi hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can strengthen our role as an offshore renminbi centre by gradually expanding the pool of offshore RMB funds and the scope of their applicability. We can also promote trading and fundraising in the stock market and the over-the-counter market, enhancing the international role of the RMB,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE is set to deliver his third Policy Address in October.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said it called the police over an incident that led to disruption to Light Rail services in Yuen Long, saying it suspected a truck had hit and damaged overhead cables.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 47-year-old truck driver on suspicion of dangerous driving. He was held for investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said no injury was reported from the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rail company said the incident happened at around 2pm, and the affected section was near the Shui Pin Wai Stop, next to Yuen Long Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm said services gradually returned to normal after around three hours, following emergency repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Light Rail routes, including 610, 614, 615, 671P and 751, had to be diverted. Free shuttle buses  were laid on for passengers.

    Survey shows more HKers participate in volunteer work

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local NGO, Agency for Volunteer Service, on Thursday said more than 54 percent of those it surveyed had taken part in organised volunteer service over the last three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its survey of more than 770 people, conducted last month, showed about 40 percent of participants volunteered through a charity or NGO. Melissa Pang, chairwoman of the agency, said reaching out to organisations to indicate a willingness to volunteer was an important first step for those looking to do volunteer work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it is very important for them to get attached to an NGO or a school or other organisations who can provide more attractive scheme of volunteering. Sometimes they [the people looking to volunteer] might have the wish, 'oh I can spare an hour now to volunteer.' However, they might not find the appropriate work to do," Pang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey also found that the economic value of volunteer service in 2023 was the equivalent to almost HK$11 billion, double the amount in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Kwong, assistant professor at Heng Seng University, said that on a scale of five, with five being the happiest, people who volunteered were happier than those who didn't.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added a new research indicator had been created that would analyse participants' interest and input in volunteering, as well as the impact it creates. The data collected would help reflect a realistic picture of Hong Kong's organised volunteering efforts.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year's Hong Kong Streetathon say participants will get a unique experience that engages all their senses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The day will include a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, as well as a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon", local delicacies will be dished out to runners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This, organisers say, will satisfy the gustatory sense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There'll be music and fragrance diffusers in parts of the route for the auditory and olfactory senses, while the scenes of Victoria Harbour, various performances, and high fives from the sidelines will satisfy the visual and tactile senses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we aim to create the most meaningful marathon by bringing the first ever 'Five-senses Marathon' into the event to enhance the overall running experience," said Andes Leung, CEO and co-founder of organiser RunOurCity Foundation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said this year's marathon not only promises a fun running experience, but is also partnered with 25 charities and NGOs to advocate for the seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Streetathon will include a family event, the Asian YOUTHRUN 10K race, designed to encourage students to participate in long-distance running activities to promote physical fitness and a healthy lifestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Streetathon will be held on December 8, with registration for the full and half marathon, and the 10K race beginning on July 25.

    Legco lowers compulsory land sales threshold

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Developers hoping to knock down old residential blocks might not have to work as hard to get flat owners to agree in future, under changes to the law approved by Legco on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At present, developers need the backing of at least 80 percent of owners to trigger a compulsory land sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new law, thresholds as low as 65 percent will apply, depending on the age of a building and its location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lowest percentage will apply to buildings across the city that are at least 70 years old, as well as any block older than 60 years in the designated areas of Wan Chai, Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei, Cheung Sha Wan, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, To Kwa Wan and Tsuen Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current 80 percent threshold will remain in place for buildings outside the designated areas that are between 50 and 60 years old, while developers will need to get the blessing of 70 percent of owners of blocks aged between 60 and 70 outside the designated areas, as well as those in buildings aged between 50 and 60 in the designated areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Development minister Bernadette Linn brushed off calls by some lawmakers for the pace of redevelopments to be slowed down because of the sluggish economy and housing market, saying addressing the issue of ageing buildings is an urgent matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while sceptics may think the changes are to benefit developers, they are actually aimed at helping society at large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most important objective is to expedite redevelopment of old and debilitated buildings, to assist building owners in addressing the building hazards and improving the living environment for all," Linn said in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every now and then, we learn from the media criticisms about our approach, and that only private developers benefit from this policy [amendment], but this is not true."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said her bureau and the Urban Renewal Authority will both set up dedicated offices to offer more support for homeowners affected by redevelopment plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said that if all goes smoothly, the new thresholds could come into effect by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most councillors spoke in support of the law changes. An amendment motion moved by Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen to keep the threshold at 80 percent in the designated areas was voted down.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday apologised to mainland bottled water and beverages company Nongfu Spring after the firm threatened legal action over a report it condemned as erroneous and "massively damaging" to its reputation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an article in the watchdog's latest CHOICE magazine – which suggested people should stop buying bottled water altogether and make do with tap water – the council noted that every litre of Nongfu Spring's bottled water contains three microgrammes of the potential carcinogen bromate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that three microgrammes is the maximum amount permitted in mineral water under European Union regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, which also covered a number of other bottled water brands, prompted an angry response from Nongfu Spring, which complained that its product should not be categorised as mineral water but "natural drinking water".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's limit for bromate in drinking water is 10 microgrammes per litre, more than three times higher than the level permitted in mineral water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the council said it has reclassified the product in question as "natural drinking water" after holding a meeting with Nongfu Spring representatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also adjusted its rating of the product, from 4.5 stars to the maximum five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council reiterated that all 30 water products it tested in the study were found to be safe to drink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring also issued a statement noting that the council has found its product to be fully compliant with the relevant standards.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Betty Fung, on Thursday said land for residential developments at the arts hub site will be sold in two or three batches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fung said the authorities will work with private developers on land sales for homes, but not for hotels and offices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because as a blueprint for diversified property development, we think it is best to keep some properties to ourselves for rental income."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank, Ryan Ip, said private residential developments at the cultural district should incorporate art elements and have areas that are open to the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Development Bureau has to act as a gatekeeper to make sure the whole project will not become a pure luxury residential project just like you can find anywhere in the city," Ip said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A project that can be seamlessly integrated within the West Kowloon Cultural District by, for example, adding in arts and culture elements in its design and also allowing the public to use some of the public open space within the residential projects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip said the land parcels are in a prime location and could bring in HK$15 billion for the authority, which is currently losing around HK$700 million a year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man from Hong Kong has been arrested in Singapore on suspicion of drug trafficking, SAR police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said it had contacted counterparts in Singapore over suspicions that gangs in Hong Kong were sending people there to smuggle drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Singaporean officers arrested a 25-year-old man as he was allegedly handing over a box to a logistics company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR police said four kilogrammes of methamphetamine worth around HK$3 million was found inside two statues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man was detained pending further investigation, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau said anyone found guilty of trafficking more than 250 grammes of methamphetamine can face the death penalty.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lands Department on Wednesday announced the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Hung Kai Properties beat 10 other bidders and won the tender for a site in Siu Lek Yuen, Sha Tin, for HK$619 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site is expected to generate around 280 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the only residential plot on offer in the April-June quarter under the government land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Victor Lui, said the company will build small and medium-sized units there, with a total investment of around HK$2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kathy Lee, head of research at Colliers, said the government's first successful sale of residential land after scrapping property-cooling measures in February sent a positive message to the market, amid concerns that developers were reluctant to bid for land.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All qualified swimmers will be allowed to participate in the long course championships held by the Hong Kong China Swimming Association in November, regardless of their affiliated club's membership status.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This emerged from a meeting on Wednesday held by the association, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, as well as former SAR team swimmer Alex Fong and other representatives, after a nine-year-old swimmer from Fong's club was barred from competing due to its low ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the meeting, president of the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, Ronnie Wong, said the body is looking to reform their membership and appeal mechanisms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The swimming association will use a scoring system to determine club membership, regularly assessing how well the club is doing in different areas such as organising events, promoting swimming in district level, training swimmers and top athletes, and the number of top athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They will also set up a system for moving up or down in rank. Clubs that perform well can be upgraded and those that fail to meet standards may be downgraded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that suggestions put forth by Fong and New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho, which include increasing transparency in the three-tier membership system and revision of the composition of the swimming association's executive committee, will be discussed in a later executive committee meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Fok, sports sector lawmaker and vice president of the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, described the meeting as positive, adding that all parties reached a consensus to improve the sport of swimming in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that he hopes the controversy could come to an end and people can focus on supporting the SAR team in the upcoming Olympic Games.

    Non-HK trained nurses to work here after law changes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says the legal changes are needed as Hong Kong faces an acute shortage of nurses. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761985_1_20240717171322.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong, with the government hoping it could help resolve an acute shortage of nurses in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials project that in 2030, Hong Kong will see a general nurse shortage of 8,700, with the number falling to 6,000 in 2040.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legal amendment introduces a new pathway allowing non-locally trained nurses to work in the SAR through special registration, without the need to pass local licensing exams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is subject to them having worked full-time for five years at specified institutions, and that their employers confirm they were satisfied with their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another pathway, there will also be limited registration or enrolment for the admission of non-locally trained nurses to serve in premises such as care homes, social welfare service units and nurse training schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current amendments to the Nurses Registration Ordinance do not seek to change the role of locally-trained healthcare professionals as the backbone of our healthcare system," health minister Lo Chung-mau told lawmakers before the passage of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Admitting non-locally trained nurses is an effective measure to address the local nurse shortage in the short term, so that Hong Kong's shortfall of healthcare professionals does not undermine the quality of healthcare and care home services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many lawmakers spoke in support of the bill, but they also expressed concern the new arrivals would need training and would need to overcome language barriers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said while bringing in non-locally trained nurses could ease the pressure of overburdened staff, he said he thinks it's not just a matter of "adding up the numbers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government needs to ensure service quality and that there would be sufficient supervision, especially at care homes.

    Exco conditionally approves arts hub funding plan
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kevin Yeung (right) says the funding plan will help the hub stay afloat for at least 10 years. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761981_1_20240717170517.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council has conditionally agreed to a funding proposal to allow the cash-strapped West Kowloon arts hub to sell some of its land parcels to ease a financial shortfall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority will be allowed to sell residential developments within Zone 2 of the site and keep all proceeds received from tenders to private developers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This means the development of residential blocks in the zone will no longer be restricted by the “Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) only" model adopted since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Culture minister Kevin Yeung on Wednesday said the plan will help the hub stay afloat for at least a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past few years, with very great effort of the authority, the BOT tender did not seem to meet with the appetites of the contractors or developers in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Instead of having a constant stream of income in the many years in future, we are now cashing in for a lump sum upfront, which could help release the financial challenges or the requirement at present."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority will have to meet certain requirements, including a triennial cap on operating deficits and a cap on the percentage of staff costs in relation to the total annual operating expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body's chairman, Henry Tang, said they can now avoid "drastic" cost-cutting measures such as reducing the number of days each week that the M+ museum is open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added that the authority will come up with ways to boost income without adding to the strain on the public coffers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to operate as we have always done under a discipline that we only spend what we need to spend and we will control our costs diligently and very seriously," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are ways that I can make more revenue without disrupting the operations of the museums and I will look for ways to do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the funding arrangement and its financial woes, DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng said the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority should explore more sources of income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority or the CSTB (Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) has to do more to make this hub an international culture arts hub," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this moment, we don't see they have a lot of different kinds of income, no matter the ticketing, renting the places... We do think there're a lot of different opportunities. So we hope that the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority do explore more different kinds of income strategies."

    Take advantage of 'panda economy': DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB urged the government to make good use of the two incoming pandas as a means to promote the local economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as the party submitted its Policy Address recommendations to Chief Executive John Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Council on Wednesday, DAB lawmaker Holden Chow said the “panda economy” could benefit the tourism, catering, and cultural sectors in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We very much look forward to these pandas coming to Hong Kong, and that would definitely boost our tourism," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the chief executive [in his Policy Address] would very much focus on the economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the New People's Party (NPP) said the government should set up a joint-immigration checkpoint at Hong Kong International Airport, to strengthen the SAR's status as an aviation hub by improving connectivity with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after submitting the NPP's Policy Address recommendations, the party’s chairwoman Regina Ip said co-location checkpoints are popular as they make travel to the mainland easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Co-location is nothing new. We already have co-location at the Shenzhen Bay control point and there will be more co-location facilities in the Greater Bay Area, and it's very popular with the visitors and with the travellers. So I don't think it will raise any legal problems. Of course, suitable legal amendments will need to be made,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the government should look at ways to attract locals and mainlanders to stay in Hong Kong over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Council, Tien said many Hongkongers are travelling north because the cost of living in the city is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whatever you buy in Hong Kong is more expensive than you can get for the same thing in Shenzhen. That's why a lot of Hong Kong people no longer spend their weekends in Hong Kong. So how do we tackle that? We suggest that we need to go high-end, to move up the market," he said.

    Govt asks CLP to speed up lightning rod installation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tse Chin-wan said he hopes CLP can install 500 lightning rods at power supply facilities in two years." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761957_1_20240717150415.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he has urged power company CLP to speed up the installation of more lightning rods, as part of efforts to avoid power outages caused by extreme weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In response to a question in the legislature, the minister said the company reported 26 "significant" outages in the past three years, 10 of which were caused by external factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said he met CLP's senior management on Tuesday to discuss recent blackouts and stopping bad weather affecting the power supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He cited the power company as saying it plans to install another 100 rods in two years at facilities such as transmission towers, but said he asked them to do 500 instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The plans are not taken forward fast enough. They're expecting in two years' time they can install 100 more such [devices], but I think this is a bit too slow," Tse told lawmakers at a council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker William Wong asked officials to lay more underground cables, so there would be less external disruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said in response that this has been the practice in new towns, but CLP still has lots of outdoor facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that the power company has told him that in the event of outages, it would deploy more manpower to help residents, as well as using mobile power supply vehicles.

 The Hong Kong Book Fair opened on Wednesday, attracting scores of visitors and book lovers to the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Abby Johnson, who teaches at TWGHs Tsoi Wing Sing Primary School, said she was hoping to buy authentic literature books for her students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secretly, I'm hoping to find some books for myself too as well later on," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student Jaccari said the fair offers better prices than book stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Book Fair usually secures a better deal, compared to maybe walking around in book stores, especially the chained ones which are more expensive," Jaccari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raistlin Lau, under secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, emphasised the importance of the fair in an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The publishing and printing industry is one of Hong Kong's important creative industries, and the Book Fair is an essential part of promoting industrial development," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as single-entry tickets which cost HK$30 for adults and HK$10 for children, visitors to the fair can also buy a super pass for HK$88 to enjoy unlimited entry to the week-long event, which ends on Tuesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Wednesday said Hong Kong should make good use of its common law jurisdiction, particularly when it comes to taking advantage of the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam participated in the 16th antechamber meeting, which focused on the Belt and Road Initiative. This monthly informal gathering brings together government officials and lawmakers from the Legislative Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Lam said Hong Kong needs to leverage its strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The central people's government takes the view that Hong Kong in future should focus on firstly enhancing Hong Kong's role as a platform for providing professional services, including, for example, to serve as an international legal service centre,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And secondly, to promote financial services and to enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre in particular in the area of green finance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same occasion, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said authorities were actively working towards strengthening cooperation with Belt and Road countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the Belt and Road Office is organising all these activities in coordination with the central government for organising visits to the Belt and Road countries, checking the enterprises and the professional services, going abroad and meeting different sectors so as to promote Hong Kong and our advantages,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau noted the government was also working towards joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a wide-ranging free trade agreement.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC announced that Georges Elhedery will become the new group CEO. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761942_1_20240717132925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC on Wednesday named chief financial officer Georges Elhedery as the bank's next chief executive to drive "the next phase of development and growth".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to confirm Georges as the next HSBC Group Chief Executive," group chairman Mark Tucker said in a filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board concluded that Georges was the outstanding candidate and we look forward to working together as he leads HSBC through the next phase of development and growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery will take over on September 2 from current CEO Noel Quinn, who announced his retirement in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery joined HSBC in 2005 and previously held the role of Co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets before being appointed chief financial officer in January 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanon-born, French-educated banker also led the bank's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkey region from July 2016 to February 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before assuming the role of CFO in 2023, Elhedery had a six-month sabbatical that included spending time learning Mandarin, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery has a "track record of leading through change, driving growth, delivering simplification, containing costs and brings a strong focus on execution," Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery said he was "deeply honoured" by HSBC's trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory," he said in the filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC said it would announce the next chief financial officer in due course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn would work with Elhedery to ensure a "smooth and orderly" handover before stepping down, the bank added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn, 62, oversaw a transformation of the London-headquartered lender and saw record profits during almost five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under him, the bank accelerated a years-long pivot to Asia -- where it generates most of its revenue -- vowing to develop its wealth business and target fast-growing markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank concluded the sales of its Canadian operations and its retail bank operations in France. It will also sell its Argentina division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn last year led the effort to repel a bid by major shareholder Ping An to spin off its Asia assets, with the proposal eventually voted down by shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The break-up bid highlighted HSBC's precarious position amid US-China tensions, with some observers questioning whether Europe's largest lender can continue to straddle East and West. (AFP)

    'Good exam results down to hard work of students'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi on Wednesday said the new citizenship and social development (C&S) subject that replaced liberal studies in this year's Diploma of Secondary Education exams didn't make it any easier for students to achieve better scores overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some 94 percent of all candidates passed the new subject, which has either a pass or fail result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the C&S subject, I think we have a standard criteria and reference for assessment. So the result doesn't mean it's easier than before and it is not comparable because it is a newly adapted curriculum,” she told reporters after giving a speech to students at a school in Fo Tan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So I think we appreciate very much the effort from teachers and also from the students that they achieved their good scores.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she is pleased to see that students’ performance across all core and elective subjects improved overall, compared to last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 17,600, or 43 percent of daytime secondary school pupils got the grades needed for a publicly-funded university place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Ariel Lau, from Jockey Club Ti-I College, said she wants to study English at either Chinese University or City University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was out of my expectations to pass all my core subjects. I had so much anxiety. I couldn't sleep last night and it was very troubling for me. I'm very conflicted right now on what to choose because before I thought I might have to take the associate degree. But now that I've got 5** in English, I think I might have the upper hand in choosing between the two programmes,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students with physical disabilities also accomplished great results. One pupil with cerebral palsy at Hong Kong Red Cross Princess Alexandra School got a 5** in business, accounting and financial studies. He said his biggest obstacle to studying was not being able to move around easily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I can't sit for a long period of time, or else my legs will feel tense. My writing speed is also a bit slower than a normal person. I need to stretch and relax my muscles frequently during my studies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, 10 students from eight schools achieved top marks across six subjects, up from four last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the top scorers came from La Salle College. One said he is going to Imperial College London to study economics, finance and data science, while another said he plans to stay in Hong Kong and study at Chinese University's medical school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe it's because a family member of mine became sick when I was young. I think a doctor doesn't just provide good treatment for patients but also provides mental support. Now that I have this chance, I would also like to provide mental support for my future patients," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the top scorers came from St. Paul's Co-educational College. One plans to study medicine in the SAR and the other economics in the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It means a lot to me because I grew up in a grassroot family. I know the struggles, I know what it feels like to struggle about your daily necessities… and by studying economics, I learn about government policies, social welfare and I can utilise my knowledge to say, not necessarily assisting the government, but maybe reflecting the needs of minorities to the government,” the second student said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong Chinese Women's Club College produced a top scorer for the first time ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very excited! Looking at the past records, more top scorers came from elite schools. I never expected myself to be one of them. I am really thankful to every teacher in the school. I hope I can encourage other students to fight hard for their dreams," the student said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other top students came from St. Joseph's College, King's College, Ying Wa Girls' School, Diocesan Boys' School and Pui Ching Middle School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, around 49,000 students received their DSE results on Wednesday.

 Hong Kong passport holders can now stay in Thailand visa-free for a maximum of 60 days, up from 30, the Immigration Department announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A department spokesperson said in a statement that the two places have a close relationship in people-to-people and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the Belt and Road Initiative, this extension of the period of visa-free entry will bring greater travel convenience to holders of HKSAR passports and strengthen the tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, 172 countries and territories have granted visa-free access, or provide visa-on-arrival services, to Hong Kong passport holders.

    Fish-allergic children may eat some fish: CUHK study

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Agnes Leung, right, says her research team has developed a ladder system to help children with allergies eat certain kinds of fish. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761827_2_20240716183654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Chinese University on Tuesday said they have developed a ladder system to help children with fish allergies reintroduce the food into their diet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The researchers said that between 2016 and 2021, they studied 249 children with fish allergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were found to be allergic to the protein β-parvalbumin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said some types of dark fish, such as salmon and tuna, have lower levels of the protein in them compared to fresh fish, such as tilapia and catfish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the researchers, Agnes Leung, said she hopes the ladder system can help children with allergies eat some kinds of fish, because the food has nutrients that can't be found elsewhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fish has very unique nutritional properties, for example, Omega 3 fatty acids are unique to fish, they help a growing child's brain development," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said they found that around 30 percent of the children in the study were not allergic to shellfish, such as shrimp and crab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major allergen in fish is parvalbumin, but the major allergen in shellfish is tropomyosin, so they are fundamentally different," Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For a lot of fish-allergic patients, they could in fact tolerate shellfish without developing allergic reactions."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty Hong Kong secondary school students will attend a young astronaut training camp on the mainland later this month, to get a taste of the country's space programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their nine-day trip includes stops in Beijing, as well as space facilities in Jiuquan, Gansu province, and Wenchang in Hainan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Space Museum said it's the first time the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre will open to a Hong Kong delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students will get to put on spacesuits, make and fly rocket models and may get to meet real-life astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the students were picked from a pool of 200 applicants, who were nominated by their schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Form two student Law Shun-yan is among those heading to the mainland and said he's very interested in the country's space development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud of China's space development. I want to become a space scientist or even an astronaut," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope to share what I experience in Jiuquan and Wenchang with others in Hong Kong, so that they get to know more about space, so we can study in this field together in future and contribute to our motherland's aerospace industry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony before the students headed off, Chief Secretary Eric Chan described the students as new blood for the SAR's integration into the country's development plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an international innovation and technological centre, Hong Kong surely has its responsibility to contribute what we can to the country's space missions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan thanked mainland authorities and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the camp, for their support.

 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) says companies in the SAR should look for investment opportunities in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edmund Lo, an economist at HKTDC, on Tuesday said investors should look out for green investments in Vietnam as this aligns with national policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another economist at the council, Henry Cheung, said Laos is looking for infrastructure investments to develop logistics, while Cambodia has several focuses ranging from digital infrastructure to being a logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irina Fan, director of research at HKTDC, said investors should look at both demand and national policies when determining business trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most important thing is to look for trade activities because when the trade activity moves up to a certain level, it will trigger investment activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) would also like to diversify from what they are doing, so this is a time where they would need investment support, they would need solution support."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nongfu Spring lashed out at the Consumer Council on Tuesday, accusing the watchdog of affecting its reputation by making what is said were biased comments towards its water content.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company demanded an apology and clarification from the watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council was following up on a lawyer's letter issued by Nongfu Spring, a day after the watchdog revealed its test results on 30 bottled water brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring said the watchdog wrongly categorised its product, applied an incorrect testing standard, and claimed the findings were misleading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also claimed the council's findings caused panic among Hong Kong and mainland consumers, and had caused "massive" damage to its brand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring stressed it would take further action unless the watchdog apologised and clarified its test results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council confirmed it had received a letter issued by Nongfu Spring's lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It maintained its analysis showed all samples of bottled water it tested were safe to drink.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten students have achieved perfect scores in this year's university entrance exams, up from four last year, while an overwhelming majority of Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam candidates passed the new citizenship and social development subject.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority on Tuesday said eight male and two female pupils got a perfect 5** across six subjects and earned "attained" in the new citizenship subject that replaced liberal studies, with eight of them also acing an extended mathematics module.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top scorers are among more than 49,000 DSE exam candidates who will receive their results on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 17,600 daytime secondary school pupils, or roughly 43 percent, met the minimum requirement needed for a publicly-funded university place, known as "332A22".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means scoring at least level 3 in both Chinese and English, level 2 in maths, and “attained” in the citizenship and social development subject, as well as level 2 in two electives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said 94.1 percent of candidates sitting the new subject achieved an "attained" level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wei Xiangdong, the authority's secretary general, said the introduction of the subject, graded with “attained” or “unattained”, was not a factor when it came to the increase in top-performing students this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it makes it easier to gain so many 5**, because all the other subjects, their assessment criteria did not change, and we used standard referencing every year. It should be equally difficult or easy to get 5** in other subjects," Wei said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricardo Mak, the director of public examinations, stressed that a number of overseas institutions recognise the new subject, including world-renowned universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Cambridge University, Simon Fraser University in Canada and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore also require students to have the ‘attained’ level in this subject to be admitted to their academic programmes,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exams authority also said it’s highly concerned that question-and-answer booklet content had been uploaded to social media platform Xiaohongshu, a move which resulted in a woman’s arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But officials said the incident did not affect the confidentiality of the exam questions, as such content was posted online after the tests had taken place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exams body added there are no plans right now to significantly expand the number of testing sites across the border after holding the exams at two centres in the Greater Bay Area this year.

    Almost six percent of Hongkongers have iron deficiency

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health officials say iron deficiency is more common in women. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761824_1_20240716172905.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly six percent of Hongkongers suffer from iron deficiency, according to a Department of Health study.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the department said it arrived at the figure after research involving 2,000 people aged between 15 and 84.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that iron deficiency, which can cause tiredness among other things, is more prevalent among girls and women, with 17.5 percent of those between 15 and 49 suffering from the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[With] regular menstruation there is blood loss, with blood loss there is iron loss, therefore women of reproductive age have higher iron requirements and are more prone to iron deficiency,” said Dr Rita Ho, head of the department's non-communicable disease branch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said 10.6 percent of females aged 15 to 49 have the more serious problem of iron deficiency anaemia, which can cause further health issues including fatigue and shortness of breath. Only 0.3 percent of males have the condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These figures are similar to those in other high income places, such as Canada and the United States, the department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said people can increase their iron intake by eating fish, eggs and beans, as well as up to 500 grammes of red meat per week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the department advised against iron supplements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is enough iron absorption [from meals] and the iron supplement is not necessary. There is too much iron in the supplements, there may be gastrointestinal side symptoms such as constipation,” Ho said.

    DAB discusses need for road maintenance

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB called for improvement to the quality of roads and pavements in Central & Western District. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761800_1_20240716153319.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB called for better road maintenance in Central and Western District to address concerns regarding uneven roads, cracked pavements, and loose and sunken paving bricks which affects the safety of pedestrians and vehicles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The DAB recently inspected roads in the district and identified more than 200 spots with poor pedestrian or traffic conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said repairs in the past were fixed with poor quality paving material because it was quick and convenient. However, many repairs were damaged over time due to tree root growth, vehicles driving, and heavy trucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have continuously reported to the Highways Department to do emergency repairs, however, the material they are using is not durable...it may only last a few days after they do repair work," said District Councillor Rex Ip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legislative Councillor Chan Hok-fung called for a re-evaluation of the quality of asphalt used for emergency repairs and the strengthening of inspections so that work could happen as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip said while bigger repairs may come with disruptions, they were necessary to ensure the durability and longevity of new roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It may take over a month to do the whole repair work [for Caine Road]. If we could show the public that after the complete maintenance work is done, it may last for a few years, even though it may cause a bit of inconvenience.”

    HK swimming body to share review findings on rules

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's swimming governing body will announce the findings of a review of its rules within this year after a recent controversy on competition qualifications, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong China Swimming Association came under fire after initially barring a nine-year-old swimmer from competing due to his club's low ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The young swimmer is now allowed to join the championships in an individual capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said sports associations should take a pragmatic approach in reviewing their rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On resource allocation and organisation of competitions, each association is required to draw up their own rules. We also believe that this is the right approach," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if problems are identified, then a pragmatic approach should be taken in resolving these issues. Discussions are necessary to consider all options on enhancing the mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that the swimming body, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China and other representatives will have a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he will lead a delegation to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia later this month to explore business opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The delegation will include professionals from the trade, legal, commerce, logistics and innovation sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Asean is Hong Kong's second largest trade partner and a huge emerging market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We attach importance to our cooperation with these countries... I will talk to the business sectors and the political circles about what Hong Kong can bring to them, opportunities in various areas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to get their support for Hong Kong to join RCEP [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership] so that Hong Kong can be a super connector and super value adder."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lee announced the start of a public consultation exercise for his next policy address, adding that his team will attend more than 40 sessions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the sessions will focus on improving the economy and people's livelihoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is an open economy. We are affected by external uncertainties, say for example geopolitical tension, high interest rates, as well as challenges from different fronts. So we need to maximise our possibilities and opportunities," he said.

    'Consider inflation when setting public housing rents'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Winnie Ho says the authorities should not casually make changes to the way public housing rent increases are worked out." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761682_1_20240715175648.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday called on the government to take into account inflation and the cost of living when reviewing public housing rents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The calls came after the Housing Authority proposed raising rents by 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved, the increases would take effect in October with a three-month exemption period for most tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Edward Lau said the government should consider how much rent tenants can afford, as the city's economic recovery after the pandemic has been sluggish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Yang Wing-kit said the exemption period suggests a need to revamp the way rent increases are decided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Out of the past eight inspections, including this one, there have been four times when the Housing Authority provided some form of exemption or deferment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the entire mechanism is working well, you wouldn't need to specifically provide exemptions or delay payments. At this point, I think we need to consider whether the mechanisms in the current regulations require a review or optimisation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the authorities should not casually make changes to the way public housing rent increases are worked out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is one thing needed to be very cautious about inflationary factors. Because when we incorporate them, we should consider the actual affordability of each tenant. Inflation goes hand in hand with deflation," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, in a deflationary period, the reduction in wages may be less than the decrease in prices. This could result in a situation where you have to reduce wages and increase rent. These are sensitive situations, and we should not make changes to our mechanisms casually."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Monday said that a girl who suffered a cardiac arrest while getting stitches at a hospital didn’t have any underlying illnesses, after tests on her were negative.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Sum-yuet, who’s now five, went to Yan Chai Hospital in late May to treat a head wound, but while getting stitches, her heart stopped beating for nearly 20 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She remains in critical condition in intensive care at Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her father had accused medical staff of pushing her head down on a pillow during the procedure, something that was denied by the HA, which said her head was tilted sideways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After meeting with the girl’s family, the HA’s chief executive, Tony Ko, again apologised over the matter, saying the gesture was needed since the “unfortunate incident” took place at a public hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he wouldn’t say whether human error was involved, citing an ongoing criminal investigation by the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko stressed he wouldn’t go into details over exactly what went wrong, but an expert review of child care guidelines recommended checking patient vitals and consider using sedatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, when doing such procedures, [the expert panel recommended] how to better communicate with the patients and the relatives, how to closely monitor the patients, as well as in suitable cases when we need to introduce procedural sedation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[The panel is] not investigating the case, so mainly the purpose is to review our present guidelines to see which are the areas that we need to further emphasise and remind our colleagues to pay particular attention.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HA chief admitted the guidelines wouldn’t clearly list out all scenarios, such as whether sedation was needed in each case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko said officials discussed with frontline staff on ways to raise the overall safety of child patients, and the recommendations would be passed on to staff again later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said two medical staff involved in the girl’s treatment were transferred to non-clinical positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko said officials would do their best to provide medical care to the girl as well as give necessary support to her family.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Terminal Expo will be held in Hong Kong this November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The expo will feature conferences, awards and forums centred on celebrating and introducing aviation technology advancements, as well as facilitating discussions about urban air mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Duck, executive vice president of Informa Market, said multiple sectors, from banking to restaurants, stand to benefit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong has been chosen for the expo because it is right at the centre as the biggest growth area for aviation in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This (expo) is very important to show to everyone within the region that the place to meet the most amount of people in the shortest amount of time, is here in Hong Kong," Duck said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vivian Cheung, acting chief executive of the Airport Authority, said Chek Lap Kok has already made good use of new technology, from the third runway and facial recognition for passengers, to automated vehicles to carry luggage.

    'Housing estates to be more accessible for elderly'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Monday spoke at the Accessible for All @ Hong Kong Symposium about making residential areas more accessible for the elderly and disabled people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About a third of Hong Kong's population will be 65 or above in around 20 years from now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elderly citizens living in older estates may not have as many aids, such as handlebars, that help them move around easily. Ho spoke about plans to install handles and assistance bars in commonly frequented areas at housing estates such as bathrooms, by the elevators, and in hallways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In our residential estate design, accessibility is of the utmost importance...it is very important for us to make it convenient for [the elderly] to be mobile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho mentioned other ideas to make areas around residences more accessible, citing hopes to build more bridges and lifts to accommodate those who live in hilly parts of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linda Lam, chairperson of the Equal Opportunities Commission, stressed the importance of creating a universally accessible society, especially as Hong Kong's population ages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accessible, barrier-free environments and facilities are the prerequisites for people with disabilities to participate equally in society," said Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As our population ages, the demand for such facilities becomes increasingly urgent."

    Beware of suspicious pop-up alerts: police

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday warned people to watch out for suspicious pop-up alerts on their computers, to avoid falling prey to "technical support" scams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said 12 cases were recorded in the past two months, with total losses amounting to more than HK$17 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said scammers send false system alerts to computers and pretend to be law enforcement agencies, before asking victims to call technical support and transfer money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Superintendent Baron Chan from the force's cyber security and technology crime bureau said victims are usually foreigners and English speakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Nowadays, the operation systems that we are using in most of our computers are Western-based. The language we use is mostly English, so that's why the scammers purport the scam alerts, they are mostly using English,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 70-year-old retiree, who gave her name as May, said she lost around HK$10 million to fraudsters who posed as police officers and technical personnel at Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The alert seemed urgent and official and being accompanied by ongoing loud noise and flashing colours on the screen. It was a relief to be offered a solution to a computer security threat, so I called the number,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan advised people to install antivirus software and avoid calling any technical hotlines, adding that the force is taking steps to block such pop-up advertisements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If your computer displays some alert message, especially in full screen, you can try to press and hold the escape key on your keyboard or press control, alternate, delete at the same time to open the task manager to close the message, or even restart your computer to try to close the problematic pop-up windows,” he said.

    Watchdog recommends boiled tap water over bottled ones

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday advised people to opt for boiled tap water instead of bottled water.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During hot summer days, people tend to lose water more easily, and staying hydrated becomes crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consumer watchdog tested 30 bottled water brands, including mineral water and distilled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The findings revealed that tap water contained a higher mineral content than mineralised purified water and distilled water with added minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also discovered that the price of tap water was around 2,700 times lower than that of bottled water, as a litre of tap water costs around $0.00262 while distilled and purified drinking water costs HK$7.02 per litre on average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said tap water is a more eco-friendly and affordable option for consumers, compared to bottled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously our tap water, after you boiled it, it is much more economical, much more friendly, especially from an environmental protection point of view. Every bottle when you produce, you know, you're polluting the environment. Every bottle that you consumed, you are creating harm to the current environment as well as the next generation,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that all bottled water it tested passed its safety tests.

    Indoor playhouses urged to ensure facilities are safe
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Consumer Council says indoor playhouse operators should ensure their terms and conditions are clearly stated. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761629_1_20240715115159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The consumer watchdog on Monday called on indoor playhouse operators to ensure the design and layout of their facilities are safe, and to clearly list out terms and conditions to avoid disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council said it had received a complaint about a child suffering a forearm dislocation and a wrist fracture from a fall while navigating a rope tunnel at a playhouse, and that a request for a refund and compensation was initially met with "ambiguous responses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The venue involved only proposed compensation of HK$3,000 after the watchdog stepped in, but the child's parent had yet to accept the offer and was considering legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The council would like to remind the industry that indoor playhouses must follow stringent safety standards in terms of game design and venue layout. They should also properly assess and mitigate any safety risks and provide sufficient safety measures to participants to ensure a positive experience for both parents and children," the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complaints included a toddler playgroup centre providing unclear terms and conditions to use complimentary playtime offered alongside a course enrolment, and another members-only indoor playhouse resetting a customer's account balance to zero without prior notice upon the expiry of the one-year membership period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The terms and conditions of use should be clearly stated, and flexible pricing policies are recommended to manage expectations and minimise disputes between traders and users," the watchdog said.

    Police meet with retail trade to address theft

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they recently met with some 40 retail industry representatives to work on ways to prevent theft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the force recorded around 37,000 cases of theft between January and May this year, which represented a three percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them, there were 3,678 cases of shoplifting, a 12 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities arrested 1,750 people in total, of which around 150 of them were caught on suspicion of making repeated attempts at shoplifting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was suspected to have shoplifted five times during the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most common age group to commit shoplifting were those between 41 and 50 years of age, followed by those aged between 51 and 60 years. Police said there was no distinction between gender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mong Kok, Tsuen Wan and Tseung Kwan O were the areas that recorded the largest numbers of shoplifting cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Common shoplifted items included pharmaceutical products, shampoo and razors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine and chocolate were the main targets from November to January each year, while fruit and ice cream were most popular during summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largest case involved two bottles of wine priced at around HK$130,000. The force said there was no fixed price range of stolen products, as shoplifters mainly act out of a sudden urge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They don't steal the items for the values of them. They don't need the items, they don't need the money," police clinical psychologist Michael Fung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In one study, more than 48 percent of them committed shoplifting because of their personal loss, psychological loss in recent times. It could be losing their spouse, their loved ones, their job, or mobility or health. That somehow triggered their depression or negative feelings, negative mood, [and] they need to find a way to cope with that.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police have offered security suggestions for the retail sector, such as allocating more staff to assist customers, arranging for security guards in plain-clothes to patrol shop floors, and upgrading surveillance cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police noted that shoplifters look the same as ordinary customers, but there are a few ways to identify potential thieves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, [shoplifters] wear extraordinarily big clothing during very hot seasons, as it is easy for them to put stolen property into their clothes and just walk out, or bringing extraordinarily big bags that are empty at first... these might be hints they want to do something,” chief inspector Kelly Choi, who works on crime prevention, said.

    HKUMed adopts generative AI literacy into curriculum

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The HKU faculty of medicine will offer a generative AI literary series as a course to facilitate and enhance teaching and learning, through various multimedia methods.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department has developed a simulation education system called KASES to imitate real-life patient scenarios and an app that helps classify X-rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regardless of their disciplines or year of study, students can use these virtual systems with information compiled and validated by professors to practice the process of clinical reasoning and history taking. This particularly benefits first-year medical students who are not yet able to attend clinicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical Associate Professor and Director of Educational Technology Dr Gary Lau explained the need for AI literacy in the medical field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our future healthcare professionals must understand not only the potentials of generative AI but also the ethical issues, potential legal aspects, and professional considerations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While AI offers new opportunities for learning, Lau stressed the importance of not becoming over dependent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Teaching can not be purely replaced by AI. It will enhance our teaching, but the interaction of our students with real life patients is highly invaluable and cannot be replaced."

    'Treat DSE results day as a learning opportunity'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Students will be receiving their DSE results on July 17. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761605_1_20240715100208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A clinical psychologist said students who do not receive an ideal grade on their DSE exams should not feel discouraged, and instead treat the experience as a learning opportunity to build resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Students will be receiving their results on Wednesday and Dr Martina Cheung, from Castle Peak Hospital, said results day is a chance for students to build stress-coping techniques in the face of a challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that students can use the "MANGO" technique to train their psychological muscle in accepting undesirable results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said the M stands for meaning and purpose in which students can treat the experience as a learning opportunity, while A, for acceptance, encourages students to accept the results rather than to question it. She said the N for nurture pushes students to take care of their bodies and practise mindfulness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "G is for gratitude and generosity because some research show that if a person can have gratitude, it's better for their mood so they can think about what they can feel grateful, and also it's important to be generous to others because by helping others, one can focus on others rather than themselves. The research shows that it can reduce the anxiety and also the depressive symptoms," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last one is optimism. By having some positive visualisation of the future, it can improve the mood of the students and also when a person has better mood, they can have broader perspective and also can have better creativity to think about how to solve the problems."
  <br/>

  Cheung stressed that parents should ask how their child would like to be supported during these times, and give them the space and freedom to process the results.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun is looking to take part in his second Olympics next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clinched gold in men's single sculls in the lightweight category of the World Rowing Cup in May, which involved athletes weighing no more than 72.5 kilogrammes. Now, he's taking on a whole new challenge by participating in the open category in the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu told RTHK he's adopting a new strategy that he believes will better prepare him against the "real giants".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Ryan Leung is the first person from the SAR to successfully swim across the North Channel, between Ireland and Scotland, one of the marathon swimming challenges of the Oceans Seven.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 35-year-old swam 40 kilometres in 14 hours and 5 minutes with the swim ratified by the Irish Long Distance Swimming Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an Instagram post, the swimmer said he spent more than three hours on the last seven kilometres due to the current.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also wrote: "not fast but once again my fat is proven life-saving – average water temperature is 12.7 degrees Celsius, but I am sure most of it was 11 degrees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who used the challenge to raise funds for charities supporting grassroots youth development, thanked his fans for all their support.

    Hydrogen bus makes maiden cross-harbour trip

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hydrogen bus makes maiden cross-harbour trip" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761546_1_20240714171843.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A double-decker hydrogen bus made its maiden cross harbour journey on Sunday, with route 170 passing through three toll tunnels, including Aberdeen Tunnel, Cross Harbour Tunnel and Lion Rock Tunnel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Richard Hall, the managing director of Citybus, said the company aims to phase out diesel buses in the next few years with plans of operating a full fleet of zero-emission buses by 2045. He said the company plans to purchase a large number of electric buses and bring in at least five hydrogen buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By running those vehicles in parallel, we have a greater volume. We will be able to get more data that will enable our future design and purchasing decisions. In terms of fares, fares have to rise on an ongoing basis. Fares are critical to supporting the sustainability of our operations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fares ensure that our employees, citizens of Hong Kong... can meet their cost of living and continue to keep pace with inflation. Fare increases also allows us to invest in new technology, improving our bus operations and delivering a great solution to all the citizens of Hong Kong that they can be proud of."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hall said their fleet composition in the future will compose of 70 percent hydrogen buses and 30 percent electric buses. He also said that Hong Kong would be put at the forefront of international and technological development for new energy solutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people were already queuing at Wah Fu Bus Terminus at around 6am to board the first scheduled bus of the day. A man surnamed Wong said he is worried about travelling through tunnels in a hydrogen bus given that it is flammable, but he said he believes the company had undergone many tests before its release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Diesel buses run on diesel so it releases a lot of exhaust smoke, and the bus is pretty loud when it is running. The hydrogen bus is a lot quieter and you can only hear the sound of the air conditioning. It is quiet inside and out," said another passenger surnamed Yau.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Sunday said the government has received an overwhelming response for the light public housing programme, receiving nearly 10,000 applications for flats under the project.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The housing minister noted that the administration received over 9,600 applications for the first batch of some 4,400 units located in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok, which will be ready early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants for these units must have been on the waiting list for conventional public housing for at least three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on a social media post, Ho urged eligible people to submit their applications regardless, saying that even if they do not get a unit this time, they will be prioritised in future rounds of applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also mentioned that she had visited the community in Tsuen Wan on Saturday to explain details of the programme to those who are interested, and reassured them not to worry about adjusting to a new living environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have visited people who only ever lived in the urban area and had never lived in the New Territories. They initially moved to Yuen Long with great trepidation. However, within a week or two, they found that adapting was surprisingly easy,” she wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The priority application period for the scheme closes on Monday.

    'Timeframe for anti-child abuse bill reasonable'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says the administration will provide 96 extra foster beds during a 18-month period to temporarily accommodate about 300 abused children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761525_1_20240714170919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Sunday said it is reasonable for a newly passed law to make reporting of child abuse mandatory to come into effect 18 months after it is gazetted.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Sun said given the complexity and scale of the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill – which requires certain professionals to report to the authorities when they suspect serious child abuse cases – a year and a half is a reasonable timeframe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand that this involves 25 different professions and there are over 100,000 people involved. There’s a lot to work on,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what needs to be done? First, we need to create detailed guidelines. We need to train these 100,000 people and make sure they understand. On the other hand, we need to prepare for the aftermath. We expect an increase in reported cases, so that we need to have enough staff, facilities, and emergency resources. Everything needs to be in place before we can proceed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added the administration will provide 96 extra foster beds during the 18-month period, which will be used to temporarily accommodate about 300 abused children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding the Social Workers Registration Board, which saw seven of eight elected members of the current term resign, Sun said he is confident that other social workers would be willing to join the board when the next election takes place at the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the TVB interview, the minister also said he did not think it was too harsh to permanently revoke the licences of social workers who have been convicted of national security offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that it does not mean the administration is not giving a second chance to social workers who have committed other crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our judgement is the mainstream view of the society and the Legislative Council, is that social workers who have committed crimes against national security are out of the question. This is a lifetime suspension arrangement. But for social workers who have committed other crimes, I want to be very clear, we are very tolerant, as long as the circumstances allow and everyone thinks it's appropriate, they can still be social workers."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that public secondary school exam results due this Wednesday should not define the future of candidates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said regardless of the results, young people can find and develop their own future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology and innovation nowadays are rebuilding different industries around the world, as well as our lifestyles," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So long as young people embrace changes, dare to imagine and keep learning, and are determined to move forward, they can surely break new ground and develop their own future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that there are ups and downs in life, and people should persevere through success and failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that the government has been promoting development in innovation and a diverse economy, with the hopes of providing more quality jobs for young people, while enhancing the economy's development, momentum and resilience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil service minister Ingrid Yeung, for her part, said public exam results are not everything in life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said for those who intend to serve the public, they can try to learn more about jobs that the government offers as early as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can be a step quicker than others and plan your career, equip yourself for the future," she wrote on social media.
