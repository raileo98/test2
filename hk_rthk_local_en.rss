Data of 17,000 public housing tenants leaked

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The data of around 17,000 people who were required to undergo Covid tests at the peak of the pandemic has been exposed online, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has warned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late on Thursday, the department said names, phone numbers, identity card numbers and addresses of residents were collected during lockdown operations between March and July in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The information was stored on an online server accessible to authorised staff using a password.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on April 30 this year, EMSD was told by the city's privacy watchdog that some information was accessible without the need for a password.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents of 14 public housing blocks are affected including those living in Yan Ching House of Kai Ching Estate in Kai Tak, Oi Ming House of Yau Oi Estate in Tuen Mun and Fu Leung House of Fu Cheong Estate in Sham Shui Po.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said it will launch an investigation but has not received any complaints so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think the situation is serious. We will initiate an investigation according to our normal procedures. We also suggest that the relevant department inform the affected individuals as soon as possible, given the relatively large number of people impacted," Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EMSD apologised for the incident, adding that it will notify the households affected by mail and "there is no evidence that relevant data has been published so far".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The matter has been reported to the police, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Security Bureau.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they believe a suspected burglar, who died after being found unconscious at Lantau's Sea Ranch, had fallen from height.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the mainland man, who's 37, crossed the border on a two-way permit on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They suspect he was part of a gang of three burgling homes at the isolated resort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents from five homes reported that their place had been broken into, with HK$7,000 and some cigarettes missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said two of the suspects had returned to the mainland on Wednesday, and they would seek help from their mainland counterparts if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they found a trail of blood from one of the blocks at the resort, adding the deceased had a blow to his head, with his jaw and teeth broken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An autopsy would be conducted to establish the cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers added they had received four reports of burglary at Sea Ranch since last December, and investigations were ongoing. No arrests have been made over those cases so far.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's securities regulator says it has started an insider dealing prosecution against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751549_1_L_20240502212148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday said it had started criminal proceedings against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its founder, director and chief investment officer Simon Sadler, and former trader Daniel La Rocca for the offence of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company prior to a block trade in June 2017.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SFC said the two defendants appeared at Eastern Magistrates' Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned to June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, a British businessman, is also the owner of Blackpool Football Club which competes in England's EFL League One division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Established in 2007, Segantii is one of the oldest and biggest hedge funds in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from Hong Kong, it also has operations in London, New York and Dubai, according to its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on its website, Blackpool Football Club said the charges were entirely unrelated to the club, and its day-to-day operations would not be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that Mr Sadler will vigorously defend himself against the charge, and there will be no further comments at the time from the Club," the statement added. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    RTHK launches new programmes in May

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a series of new programmes from May, covering topics from news and current affairs to youth, family, and community activities, as well as education and culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new programmes will be broadcast across RTHK's eight channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony on Thursday, RTHK’s assistant director, Vincent Lee, said RTHK is committed to innovative production, nurturing new talent, and recruiting skilled individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that over 80 new employees joined the public broadcaster following multiple rounds of civil service recruitment conducted in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that pure audio content was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the public and the broadcaster would utilise more advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to visualise radio programmes and distribute content across different platforms to reach a wider audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, he said RTHK’s productions would deepen its connection with the mainland to tell good stories of Hong Kong and China - as 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK would also provide comprehensive coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics, as well as the 2025 National Games, through television, radio, and new media platforms, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK's director of broadcasting Eddie Cheung, vice chairman of the Board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority Bernard Chan and chairman of RTHK Board of Advisors Lam Tai-fai also attended the ceremony.

    Inland Revenue expects 12% rise in tax collection

Inland Revenue expects 12% rise in tax collection
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751510_1_L_20240502164437.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Inland Revenue Department on Thursday said it expects a 12 percent increase in the amount of tax it collects this year, following a drop last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures show the department collected HK$342 billion in the last tax year, which was HK$18.2 billion or about five percent lower than in 2022-23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said it expects tax revenue to rise to HK$382 billion this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said stamp duty revenue is likely to hit HK$71 billion this year, following a 30 percent decrease to HK$49.1 billion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commissioner of Inland Revenue Tam Tai-pang noted that the city's "spicy" property cooling measures were scrapped in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The year 2023-24 had seen a significant drop in property market transactions... and that contributed largely to a significant drop in the stamp duty collections for the year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that after the abolition of all the demand-side management measures for residential properties, there's a notable increase in property transactions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it has sent out about 2.44 million tax returns for individuals for the 2023-24 financial year. People have until June 3 to post them back, or until July 3 if the returns are filed via e-Tax.

Waste-charging trial to continue this month: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Thursday said the pay-as-you-throw trial would continue this month as planned, despite feedback that cleaners and participants are having a hard time with the scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government selected 14 buildings and premises to test the waste-charging scheme, which began last month, with participants using designated garbage bags and tags to dispose of their rubbish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had earlier delayed the scheme's full rollout from April to August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Warner Cheuk, said that there were still many problems with the trial, and that there must be "public consensus and favourable conditions" to roll out the scheme smoothly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said officials were aware the scheme had increased the workload of cleaners and that some participants found it troublesome, adding the government would carefully look into these matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they would faithfully report these issues to lawmakers at a meeting planned before the end of this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The waste charging scheme really affects the whole population," the minister said after attending an event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How can we implement it so that everyone can accept it, and people won’t find it too much of a disruption, so the scheme can run smoothly -- these are all things we need to think about."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said a six-month grace period for restaurants to continue giving out single-use plastic utensils should be long enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From April 22, eateries had to switch to alternative utensils, but they can still give out plastic containers for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said those who had yet to switch had told officials they were trying to clear their plastic stock, or were waiting for the alternatives to arrive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials would visit smaller eateries in the coming months to see if they need any help.

Consumer Council criticised over privacy breach
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751485_1_L_20240502131730.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung on Thursday criticised the Consumer Council over a data breach last year, saying the watchdog contravened the Personal Data Ordinance with its deficiencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An attack by hackers resulted in the leak of personal data on more than 450 individuals, including staff members and people who filed complaints with the council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung's office said the council started allowing staff to connect to its server using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when work-from-home arrangements were introduced during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the council failed to enable multi-factor authentication for the remote access and a hacker group obtained the credentials of a user account before deploying ransomware in the council's servers and endpoints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Chung said the council had not taken all practicable steps to protect personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The protection given by this multi-factor authentication would be enhanced to over 99 percent if this feature is enabled," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung added that two weeks passed before the council realised there had been a breach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cybersecurity solution was supposed to send an email alert to the council once it detected any cybersecurity attack. However, in this case, after the incident the council discovered that the cybersecurity solution was not properly configured," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That was why even though it detected the attack in question, it did not send any email alert to the council for this particular incident, and that was why the council only discovered the cyberattack on September 20 [last year]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has served an enforcement notice on the council and has ordered it to submit proof within two months that it has adopted improvement measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the council said it attaches great importance to cybersecurity and has adopted various measures since the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The measures include] enabling multi-factor authentication for remote data access via VPN, conducting a comprehensive review of the cybersecurity solutions' functions and appropriate settings, and further strengthening internal training to enhance staff's awareness and behaviour on cybersecurity," it said in a statement.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Thursday urged the government to improve the quality of public housing as supply catches up with demand.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation said it expects the average waiting time for a public flat to fall from the current 5.8 years to 4.6 years by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s vice president, Ryan Ip, said 35,000 units are expected to be completed each year in the next five years, exceeding the government's long-term target of 30,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The total completion of public housing in the next 10 years, no matter which scenarios, it can fulfil the government's own targets. So, with this overall background, then we can sort of move from quantity to the quality side," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, first of all, we advocate for a steadily increasing of the size of housing units of public housing in the next five to 10 years.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for private housing, Ip said the supply will remain stable even though the government saw a record six failed land tenders last year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the ongoing slump in the yen which sank to a new 34-year low earlier this week, Japan has seen an influx of Hongkongers taking advantage of the weaker currency and snapping up everything from designer goods to daily necessities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the yen fell to 160 to the US dollar before recovering. The Japanese currency was down some 10 percent since the start of the year and 30 percent from three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Hong Kong travellers have been visiting Japan since the end of the pandemic, and the trend is not about to end anytime soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The yen is very cheap right now, so it’s a great time to go shopping here,” said Maggie Kwong, a Hong Kong banking professional who went to Tokyo for her second trip to Japan this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, I went to buy a pair of running shoes... Usually the shoes would cost around HK$1,000, but I was able to buy it for just under HK$500 for the same pair of shoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So definitely, the fact that the yen has weakened has given me more motivation to come visit Japan and to spend more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Huen, executive director of EGL Tours, told RTHK that the number of Hongkongers travelling to Japan was up 20 percent in both March and April compared with a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said a weaker yen does not necessarily mean cheaper tours, citing higher demand not only from Hong Kong but also around the world, especially North America, with a record three million foreign holidaymakers in Japan in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huen also said Japanese people who opted to travel domestically instead of overseas added to demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, he said Hongkongers find prices to be attractive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A ramen index also suggested that a ramen in Japan now costs about HK$50, versus the about HK$120 to HK$150 in Central in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been speculation that Tokyo has intervened to prop up the currency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An actual intervention would be authorities directly selling US dollars and buying the yen in the foreign exchange markets to support the yen, but the impact from such an intervention will be rather short-lived because the foreign exchange reserves that the Japanese government holds are limited,” Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will not change the yen’s weakness in the long term, before the US Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates later this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects the yen to remain at about 150 to 160 against the greenback for some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This will give travellers from Hong Kong an advantage to visit Japan, but it will make the Hong Kong inbound tourism recovery even slower due to the linked exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar,” Cheung noted.

'Labour Day tourist figures as expected'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, on Thursday said tourist figures for the first day of the mainland's Golden Week holiday were in line with expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said arrivals in the SAR exceeded 460,000 on May 1, including around 180,000 from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some tourists complained on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu that bad weather marred a fireworks show over Victoria Harbour on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui told an RTHK programme that he thinks the visitor numbers would have been even higher if the weather had been better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, some people joked that they didn't just see the fireworks but smoke as well. I believe this is to do with the weather. But I think visitors who came to Hong Kong were generally satisfied. It's very common to say a few words on social media platforms," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing his views, wholesale and retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said items such as jewellery and cosmetics were popular among tourists on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shiu added that he hopes the government will continue to improve publicity for mega events and support airlines to beef up their flight capacity.

    New flu trend detection model for better vaccines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CUHK Faculty of Medicine's research team developed a computational model to forest viral genetic evolution. Photo: CUHK Faculty of Medicine" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751406_1_L_20240502004550.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese University researcher said a new computing model could help the authorities make better choices in selecting the strain of flu they vaccinate people against.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health officials have to choose which vaccine to order ahead of each flu season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maggie Wang, who developed the new model, known as beth-1, with colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine, said it could predict how the virus would change in the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the model would give authorities early warnings of emerging virus variants, particularly for the H3N2 virus, the H1N1 virus and the influenza B virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This information is particularly important for the WHO (World Health Organisation) because each year or each season, the next season's influenza vaccine strain should be determined earlier, that is almost nine to 12 months ahead of the target season. A prediction model can provide critical information to inform the decision makers of the optimal vaccine strain to select," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For pharmaceutical companies, the forecasting model is also very useful because the manufacturing of the influenza vaccine has a really compact timeline. So earlier prediction can give more time and the buffer for the manufacturers to prepare the vaccine development and manufacturing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that their research team has already been working closely with institutions in the mainland to conduct animal experiments for manufacturing more effective vaccines using the beth-1 model.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did the prospective validation using mice model. That is, we predict the next season, the future season's representative viral strain, and then use this strain to make the vaccine to immunize the mice, and we also immunize another group of mice using the current vaccines," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And after a few months, when the target season comes, we collect the circulating viruses from the Prince of Wales Hospital, and then use this circulating virus to challenge the immunized mice, and compare how strongly antibody response in these two groups of mice. The outcome is that our model-predicted strain generates significantly higher, or non-inferior neutralization titer, antibody response against the circulating viruses."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk on Wednesday said a trial has shown that there are still many problems with the government's long-delayed waste charging programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pay-as-you-throw scheme was tested at 14 locations from last month, covering homes, shops and restaurants, but only about half of the households participated by using designated bags to dispose of trash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk said a working group had been meeting every week to discuss the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial observations, there are many problems. We think that if we introduce the waste charging scheme, we must have a consensus and support from Hong Kong people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's because this policy directly affects the seven million people in Hong Kong. There must be favourable conditions in various areas in order to roll the scheme out smoothly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials had earlier said it remained to be seen whether a full rollout would go ahead on August 1 as planned.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Wednesday said an 8pm pyrotechnic display over Victoria Harbour will go ahead as planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show had been in doubt because of inclement weather, but the board says forecasts show it's fine to go ahead, warning people attending to bring rain gear and check the conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's good news for tourists in town for the Labour Day holiday who had been anxiously checking the weather ahead of the fireworks show, which is the first in a series planned to mark holidays and festivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who is making a three-day trip from Zhejiang province, said it is her first time in Hong Kong and she really wants to see the fireworks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really want to see it...I think the scene will be fascinating. I've watched similar shows on the mainland, but I think that may be different in Hong Kong," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And some mainland tourists said they would not be staying overnight because of the high prices for hotels during the holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will go back to Shenzhen at night, but we may come again on Friday. The price of a hotel room in Shenzhen is just a third of that in Hong Kong. That's a huge difference," a tourist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said as of 4pm, there were about 237,000 tourist arrivals, and that includes nearly 140,000 mainland tourists.

    Hong Kong Observatory verifying reports of hail

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Posts from several social media platforms said that hail was falling in Hong Kong. Image: Facebook" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751351_1_L_20240501125814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory is verifying social media posts which apparently showed hail falling in Hong Kong as the city was hit with storms overnight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During an amber warning issued at about 9.30pm on Tuesday, posts from several social media platforms reported that hail was falling in Yuen Long. One video on Instagram showed residents there running for cover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said it is verifying the social media posts, and noted that there were reports of hail fall from Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last year, there were also hail reports in March and April,” Betty Mak, a scientific officer at the Observatory, told RTHK, noting that there is nothing unusual for it to hail this time of year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We’ll consider all the data and observations including the stability of the atmosphere and analysis of radar images and hail reports from nearby areas or locally to assess."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Members of the public should consider bringing rain gear when going out,” Mak added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster also said lightning struck the east of the territory more than 6,400 times between 10pm and 10am. “Violent gusts” of over 100km per hour were also recorded in Cheung Chau early on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a concert that was being held in Central was forced to stop midway when the amber signal came into effect on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And several flights were affected by the weather, with some being delayed or rerouted to land in other airports in the Pearl River Delta area.

    'More weight on GDP growth needed for minimum wage'

'More weight on GDP growth needed for minimum wage'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751345_1_L_20240501111023.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Wednesday said authorities should give more weight to the growth of the SAR's economy in a new formula for calculating the minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Executive Council on Tuesday approved recommendations to review the minimum wage every year instead of every two years, and under the new mechanism, the minimum wage would not be reduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new formula will take into account the consumer price index and 20 percent of the difference between the previous year’s GDP figure and economic growth in the past decade, with a cap of one percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTU chairman Kingsley Wong welcomed the change, but he said the hourly minimum wage would only increase by about HK$1 every year under the new mechanism, which is not ideal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Grassroots workers should also be able to share the results of economic prosperity. It's too low to only include [20 percent of the GDP growth difference]. This is what the mechanism is short of," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that employers, employees, officials and scholars should review the mechanism, for example, in every five years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said calculations should include 30 percent of the GDP growth difference instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said the catering sector will not see a huge increase in operating costs because of the new mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the labour shortage situation, the hourly wage for the catering sector is a lot higher than the minimum wage... For temporary positions, restaurants mostly have to pay workers at least HK$50 to HK$60 per hour, and some Chinese restaurants even pay their frontline staff HK$80 or more," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, labour secretary Chris Sun brushed aside concerns that the new mechanism would undermine Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, he said the government has considered many factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to ensure that the wage won't be too low, while minimising the loss of low-paid jobs. We also have to consider the competitiveness of the city at the same time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can't see how the modified minimum wage mechanism would affect the competitiveness of Hong Kong and the business sector," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, meanwhile, said on social media that the changes could protect grassroots workers. He expressed the hope that officials could work with various sectors to build a "reasonable, fair and safe" environment for workers.

 The Hong Kong Observatory warned on Tuesday evening that hail could affect the SAR after it was reported in the Pearl River Delta.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hail was reported in Macau as authorities there called on residents to stay indoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Hong Kong, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 9:30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster called on people to be alert and seek safe shelter, as violent gusts reaching 110 kilometres per hour affect the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department called on employers to avoid assigning workers to carry out electrical work, and protect the safety of those engaged in such tasks.

  "Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by the rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent electric shock as the air would be more humid," said a spokesperson from the department.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.

    'New changes to minimum wage fair for businesses'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association says the new way of calculating the minimum wage is fair for businesses. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751243_1_L_20240430180505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker and a representative of small and medium-sized firms on Tuesday welcomed the new way of calculating Hong Kong's minimum wage, which now takes into account the city's economic development and consumer prices.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Danny Lau, the honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the shake-up is fair for business operators and workers, but it is unreasonable there is no chance of the minimum wage being reduced if times get tough for businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing that we worry is you can only [increase it], you cannot decrease the minimum wage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new changes, the minimum wage would not be reduced but frozen even if the formula produces a negative number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if it would put pressure on bosses in small and medium-sized firms when the economy is not doing well, Priscilla Wong, who chairs the Minimum Wage Commission, said a balance needs to be struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These are the people with the lowest ability to bargain, the least bargaining power. And as a society, we are hoping that their wages do not go through vertically down and go down to the point that we lose our wage floor,” she told a media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing welcomed the new mechanism, but he told RTHK the administration should give greater weight to GDP in the calculations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the proportion that [accounts for] the growth in GDP can be more. This means if we have a large growth of the GDP and then we can have an increase in minimum wages level, that's very important because it allows our grassroots workers to share the fruit of economic development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Party's catering sector lawmaker, Tommy Cheung, earlier said the minimum wage could hurt the SAR's competitiveness, calling on authorities to scrap it altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But labour minister Chris Sun dismissed the suggestion, saying the new changes ensure there is room for low-paid workers to maintain their purchasing power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design of the formula is to make sure that while we remain competitive, we have to also take care of the needs of those at the very low level. We're just talking about a small number of workers. And as a society, we should help them to make sure that at the very low level, we have enough room for them to be able to earn.”

    HK to adopt new way of calculating minimum wage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a shake-up of the way Hong Kong's minimum wage is decided, with the wage floor to be reviewed every year in future instead of every two.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Calculations will include the SAR's economic growth rate in the previous year, as well as consumer prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There'll be no chance of the minimum wage being reduced regardless of what the figures suggest, with any negative calculation leading to a freeze instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it is making the changes based on recommendations from the Minimum Wage Commission, which consulted labour and employer groups as well as academics on the matter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first minimum wage under the new mechanism will be set in two years' time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The recommendations of the [commission] have struck an appropriate balance between the objectives of forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness," said Labour Secretary Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's minimum wage is currently set at HK$40 per hour. The Minimum Wage Commission is to submit a report by the end of October on its recommendations for any change.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials on Tuesday warned that an extended flu season would continue for some time, with more outbreaks and serious cases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Centre for Health Protection urged the public to remain vigilant as Hong Kong has seen a rise in flu infections, with more than 500 adults suffering serious complications or dying since January. Most of them are over 65 or have chronic illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been 22 severe flu cases among children, including three deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, from the Centre for Health Protection, said health authorities were closely monitoring the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The predominant flu strain has shifted from H3 to H1, resulting in another wave of infections. We expect this wave to continue for a few weeks, but it's difficult to say exactly how long," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are closely monitoring other regions of the world, as Hong Kong residents travel a lot. Influenza B is still circulating in some parts outside Hong Kong, so we cannot rule out the possibility of a further change in the flu strain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Health authorities urged the public to seek medical attention if they experience flu-like symptoms.

    Movie lovers say farewell to President Cinema

Movie lovers say farewell to President Cinema

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of movie lovers on Tuesday bade farewell to President Cinema in Causeway Bay, bringing the curtain down on almost six decades of showing films.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its operator, Newport Circuit, had announced last week that the theatre on Jaffe Road was closing after Tuesday, though it did not say why.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Newport Circuit thanked customers for their support throughout the years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While some people were just there to snap pictures, others bought tickets for the final shows at the theatre that first opened in 1966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo, an actor, said it was a pity that a platform which showcased cinematic productions was disappearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been here one or two times many years ago," he said. "I don't care if it's old or if the seat is good or bad, I just want to [catch a film] for the last time in this cinema."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another movie-goer, Alice, said she was watching a film at the cinema for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This kind of old cinema is very rare. They disappear when the industry is on decline and not many people are buying tickets, so I think if I have the chance to sit down and watch a movie [here] once, I'd like to go," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A regular customer, meanwhile, said the cinema brought back a lot of memories for her, from the days when people could still buy grilled squid before going into the theatre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's nothing we can do. Now everyone watches movies at home," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, a Golden Harvest cinema in Kai Tak also closed down, following the end of its tenancy contract.

 Police on Tuesday said they have arrested and charged a man and were searching for another over a crane collapse that killed three workers at a construction site in 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers announced the arrest of a 35-year-old former project manager with the main contractor involved in the building construction in Sau Mau Ping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been charged with manslaughter and will appear in Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a warrant was issued for a 72-year-old structural engineer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aggressive Construction Company, the contractor for the site on Anderson Road, confirmed earlier that a former employee had been arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company added that it is being prosecuted over the crane collapse.

    'More support needed for carers in subdivided flats'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scholars on Tuesday called on the government to offer more support for people who look after children or elderly relatives while living in subdivided housing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a survey conducted by Lingnan University and Chinese University, 95 percent of the 315 caregivers surveyed, who live in subdivided homes, were found to be stressed out, while 20.5 percent of respondents exhibited signs of depression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press conference, Ruby Lai from Lingnan University's Department of Sociology and Social Policy said caregivers had been struggling with stress from the unsuitable living conditions, expensive rents and excessive workloads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we see is that there are many spatial constraints at home, like there's no separations of kitchen and toilet, or there's no independent cooking place, so that they have to set up a makeshift cooking space for them to cook every time and then to pack up all the things to leave this space for their children to do homework," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai called on the government to ensure better quality of life for caregivers living in such conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also called on authorities to roll out cash subsidies to relieve the stress faced by caregivers in subdivided housing, and strengthen community support.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said there's plenty for tourists to do in Hong Kong during the Labour Day Golden Week holiday, even if Wednesday night's pyrotechnic display might be cancelled due to weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities had warned that the 10-minute show at Victoria Harbour on May 1 could be called off if rain and thunderstorms happen as predicted. A decision would be made on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The display is scheduled to be the first in a series of occasions marking the city’s mega events and festivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said weather would not affect other events during the national holiday this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to do the best to ensure that [the show] will be most welcome and enjoyed by everybody, tourists and Hong Kong people. But of course, the weather is always unpredictable," he said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a wide range of activities that have been arranged to welcome visitors during Golden Week."

People are adapting to plastics ban: CE
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751162_1_L_20240430114308.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said people are getting to grips with a ban on single-use plastic utensils, a week after it took effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, he said there are signs of people steadily changing their habits, citing a media report that said two-thirds of people are no longer taking plastic utensils in restaurants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On complaints from some people that alternative cutlery products are of low quality, Lee said he thinks suppliers and restaurants will get better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course during the process there's always room for us to make improvements. For restaurant operators and alternative [utensil] suppliers, I believe [they] will continue to improve their work and they will continue to supply different types of alternatives to disposable tableware," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan will continue to explain the new policy, after questions arose as to whether plastic containers can be used for takeaway food.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said authorities will keep an eye on the way people adapt to the initial phase of the ban, as well as the supply of substitute products, before deciding what to do next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, the government had earlier said that plastic containers and cups – which are still allowed for takeaways at the moment – will be banned completely in the next phase.

 A paediatrician said on Tuesday that Hong Kong's flu season is running longer than normal this year, with cases still increasing rather than tapering off as expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Mike Kwan from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=949557&livetime=20240430000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  </a>
  programme that the extended flu season reflected a global phenomenon, with people's immunity against viruses falling when measures were imposed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He says Hong Kong now faces what he called a tridemic, with people threatened by flu, Covid and another respiratory infection, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, as well as other conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked when the flu season would conclude, he told RTHK's Janice Wong: "We cannot make a prediction yet because the number is still rising and we are still seeing so many of the severe cases. Unfortunately, we hear about the news of another fatal case yesterday. This is very sad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I cannot make a prediction at this moment, but I just hope that the citizens can just go and have the flu vaccine if they have not yet received the vaccine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said acceptance of the flu vaccine remained relatively low in Hong Kong. He also suggested people wear masks in crowded areas, use proper hygiene and stay home if they have the flu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of an NGO said on Tuesday that many Hong Kong social workers are experiencing burnout as they face a range of challenges, including an increasing workload as more people in society face difficulty with their mental health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=949557&livetime=20240430000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  programme,  Chou Wah-shan from the mental health group Dreams Possible said a survey conducted with University of Hong Kong academics found that 93 percent of the 255 social workers interviewed experienced a moderate level of work-related stress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the study also found signs of depression in 68 percent of the interviewees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The issue of burning out is becoming more and more alarming," he told RTHK's Samantha Butler. "Because I think in the past couple of years, Hong Kong has been facing huge challlenges in many aspects: socio-economic, political.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also, many people are feeling frustrated and are having emotional and mental illness issues. That's why the workload of social workers, as the helping profession, has immensely increased, together with the intensity of clients' emotional issues, including emotional issues, depression, anxiety disorder or even suicidal issues."

    Inquest experts differ over patient's liver failure

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Professor Henry Pleass says Tang Kwai-sze’s acute liver failure was absolutely because of a hepatitis B flare-up. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751062_1_L_20240429173646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transplant surgeon has stressed that a second organ transplant for a liver disease patient was the only way to keep her alive, as the Coroner’s Court heard conflicting explanations as to why the patient developed acute hepatic failure before her death.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017 and died in August that same year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Pleass, a transplant surgeon in Australia, said it was unfortunate that medical practitioners did not give Tang medication needed along with the steroids she was taking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s our modern system with many other doctors looking after one individual. There’s no continuation,” he told the inquest's five-person jury and coroner Monica Chow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We made the assumption that people have thought about the issue, and thought about the risks.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had experienced medical issues after the first transplant and Pleass said while doctors could have treated her conservatively, the surgery for a new organ gave her a chance of survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the cause of Tang’s liver failure, Pleass said it was “absolutely” because of a hepatitis B flare-up, ruling out the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis as suggested by another expert witness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, histopathologist Wilson Tsui said it was more likely that Tang suffered from autoimmune hepatitis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui said the high count of plasma cells and the absence of serologic markers, which are used to identify antibodies formed following an infection, indicated that a hepatitis B flare-up was less likely to have been the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To differentiate between a reactivation of hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis, [the count of plasma cells] is a relatively important index,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But James Fung, an expert witness called to give evidence again after Tsui’s testimony, said the majority of patients with an acute hepatitis flare-up would still test negative for such serological markers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung, a transplant hepatologist at Queen Mary Hospital, also noted that while a higher count of plasma cells is commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis, there could be exceptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially with very severe acute flares of hepatitis B, [plasma] cells themselves are often seen in these severe cases,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing continues.

    Govt to adopt new heatstroke rules for outdoor workers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Labour Department says its updated guidelines on when outdoor workers should take a break under hot weather conditions will take effect next month. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751046_1_L_20240429163232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour officials on Monday said they were updating guidelines on when outdoor workers would be advised to stop working when it's very hot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This would enable the department’s heat stress warning system to be in line with the observatory's warnings about hot weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory’s "extremely hot special alert" is issued when it's generally 35 degree Celcius and above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some environmental and workers' groups had called for such a linkage between the two alert systems last year when the department’s guidelines were introduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said the updated guidelines would apply next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The guidelines also set out the varying lengths of breaks workers should be given every hour when the heat stress warnings are in effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new rules state that if employers adopt a certain amount of measures to prevent heatstroke - such as reducing workload, providing shades and using mist fans to improve ventilation - they can completely cut the hourly breaks for workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If insufficient measures were adopted, the guidelines said, employers would be required to give longer breaks to workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Employers would be given flexibility to alternate break times for different workers, and they can split break periods into shorter ones so as to minimise the effects on work progress.

    Jail term needed for not reporting child abuse: govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ho Kai-ming says society will have to bear the consequences if the threat of prison is scrapped from the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751038_1_L_20240429153738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Undersecretary for Labour and Welfare, Ho Kai-ming, on Monday said jail terms for professionals who fail to report suspected child abuse cases should be kept in the draft legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, which is currently making its way through the Legislative Council, the maximum penalty for not reporting suspected severe child abuse cases would be a three-month jail term and a fine of HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, saying it is too harsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legco's bills committee, Ho reassured lawmakers that professionals, who work with children, would only face prison if they fail to report extremely severe cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Professionals will only face imprisonment in extremely severe cases. This means that professionals, who genuinely suspect that a child has suffered significant harm - or is facing actual risks - yet fail to report it without meeting any exemptions for reporting or providing any reasonable justifications, only then will prosecution be initiated," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho warned that scrapping a prison sentence from the bill would lower the effectiveness of the legislation, and society would have to bear the consequences.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Monday that a "soft sell" approach will be adopted when it comes to promoting patriotism in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan, who chairs the new Working Group on Patriotic Education, said the group is aimed at integrating patriotism into core values of the community, but this will not involve "hard sell" tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patriotism is not something that can be learnt by repeating from memory. Getting to understand is the first step. The ultimate goal is to achieve emotional identification. Sincerely identify with the country, feel proud of the country and then consciously love and protect the country," Chan told reporters after an inaugural meeting of the working group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the group will make reference to the mainland's patriotic education law and come up with appropriate and suitable proposals for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the government has no plans to legislate patriotism and will rely on policies and activities to promote it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said the government will organise various activities and celebrations in the run-up to October's 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to enable young people to learn more about their country.

    Art 23 places no limits on press freedom: Paul Lam

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750995_1_L_20240429111837.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday said national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law places no "extra and unreasonable" restrictions on press freedom and the media can still sharply criticise the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an op-ed published in Ming Pao Daily, the minister said there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration wants the media to pass on accurate, fair and positive information so that officials can lead society to make changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, [officials] need to comprehensively know the ideas, needs and demands from the public [through the press]," Lam wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said so long as the media continue to be impartial, objective and fair in adhering to fundamental professional codes in seeking the truth, there is no need for journalists to be particularly concerned about violating the security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the piece titled "Change and no change", Lam said while the enactment of the homegrown security law last month marked a major change, there are also things that have remained constant such as the values of common law and the rule of law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand it improved the legislation on safeguarding national security. It also fully respects fundamental human rights and freedoms on the other," he wrote.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers and families of pupils at Rosaryhill Secondary School say students are left on their own after the school decides to cease operations early. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750934_1_L_20240428184716.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers and families of pupils at an aided Catholic school in Wan Chai on Sunday accused education officials of inaction over the institution's decision to shut earlier than it had originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rosaryhill Secondary School on Stubbs Road first announced last September that it would cease operations after the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government-aided school later said it would arrange for Form One to Five pupils to transfer to Yu Chun Keung Memorial College No 2 this September. Rosaryhill Kindergarten and Rosaryhill (Primary) School, meanwhile, will be combined with Dalton School Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brother of a Form Five pupil – a former Rosaryhill student himself – expressed concerns about his sister's education at her new school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Education Bureau was relatively passive and not willing to help us on this issue... Pupils are not as simple as assets that you could transfer to others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother of a Form Three student condemned the Education Bureau for not having met parents over the issue, which she said weighed heavily on her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee legislator Doreen Kong urged the administration to address the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We don't want this to happen again. The [Education Bureau] must explain to the public what the principles are and what the policies of the government are in handling all these similar situations,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to come out to help the students and to ensure that there is a smooth transition for all the students, especially to overcome their psychological distress."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said he would file a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I find that the school is not professional enough to take care of the students. And the administrative side is also not totally concerned about the rights and interests of students and parents... I want to clarify, during the process, what role did the administration play," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tik said he would also talk to authorities on pushing back the school’s shutdown, to let senior secondary pupils finish their studies there.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn said officials want to step up training of sewer workers to prevent incidents involving manholes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her comments came after the death of two workers last week at a manhole in Sha Tin, the same site where two others died nearly two decades ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Linn said the contracts state that workers should only operate on the ground, and if relevant works require them to enter the manhole, only qualified personnel are allowed and risk assessment must be conducted beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said officials are looking into adding clauses to future contracts, requiring workers who only conduct cleaning on the ground to go through training as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you do enter manholes [in future], you have to inform the Drainage Services Department beforehand and receive its approval," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're considering making it mandatory for those doing the cleaning on the ground to also go through manhole training. This is to raise their awareness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Linn said officials are considering whether to immediately prosecute homeowners found to have illegal structures, rather than issuing orders for removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has been reviewing the Buildings Ordinance after cases of unauthorised structures were reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development secretary said the administration is studying whether the prosecution process can be streamlined, the prosecution threshold lowered and relevant fines raised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that a clause in the current legislation stipulates harsher penalties for offenders who "knowingly" violate the law. Linn said officials want to remove such wording, which she said allows homeowners to claim they were not aware of the illegal structures and that the problem had already existed before they bought the place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said officials will make sure the relevant amendments – to be put forward in the final quarter of this year – will be reasonable.

 Tourism chief Kevin Yeung said a pyrotechnic display scheduled for May 1 may be cancelled because of bad weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show, hosted by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, is set to be held across Victoria Harbour to kick off a campaign of regular fireworks displays aimed at boosting tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But according to the Observatory's forecast, the weather on Labour Day is expected to be cloudy with showers and squally thunderstorms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for culture, sports and tourism on Sunday said authorities could wait until Wednesday to decide whether the show would be held as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We shall keep an eye on the weather and make announcements as early as possible. It may not be until the afternoon of May 1 that we can officially say whether the display will be affected," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that tourists coming to Hong Kong will be prepared mentally that some performances may not be possible due to the rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the administration is prepared for the arrival of visitors in the coming week, adding that hotel bookings for the Golden Week holiday have been strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Golden Week holiday will help boost businesses in Hong Kong. Of course, I hope if the weather is good, it will be more convenient for those visiting Hong Kong," he said.

Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750907_1_L_20240428151400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government on Sunday announced measures to facilitate visits by mainland business representatives and skilled workers to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, mainland residents holding Business Visit Endorsements will be permitted to stay in Hong Kong for up to 14 days, starting from May 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainlanders who wish to travel to Hong Kong for business purposes are required to obtain an exit endorsement for business visit from the mainland authorities, and at the moment they're allowed to stay here for up to one week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities also announced that mainland residents can apply for the travel document at any relevant offices across the country, regardless of the applicant's place of household registration or place of residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, Wang Ling from the National Immigration Administration said the change can benefit more than 100 million business entities across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This change aims to better meet the needs of long-term business activity and to support business professionals in seeking opportunities and conducting in-depth business negotiations. According to our preliminary estimates, the new policy is expected to benefit over 100 million businesses and more than 30,000 enterprises and institutions that have registered and applied for multiple Business Visit Endorsements," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said they will extend the multiple-entry visas for skilled workers to visit Hong Kong and Macau which currently applies only to Greater Bay Area residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From May 6, eligible talent from Beijing and Shanghai will too be able to apply for the visa to visit the two SARs, with each stay limited to 30 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun thanked the central government for the new measures, saying they would help the SAR to attract talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two new measures will facilitate Hong Kong's further integration into the national development and achieve concrete results on the solid policy foundation of facilitating the 'southbound and northbound' two-way flow of talents," a government spokesperson added in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR government will continue to promote talent exchange with the mainland authorities, to create a stronger drive for growth in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the scheme involving skilled workers may be extended to more mainland cities in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It depends on the implementation. We have the potential to have these arrangements further expanded to other cities, especially those cities with closer business connections with Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the central government will look at the actual situation and decide whether to expand or not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who's also general manager of the artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Hong Kong, said the new measures would enhance the SAR's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Singapore already provides visa-free to mainland China, right?... Hong Kong needs to be more attractive. So, today the scheme has some benefits for Beijing and Shanghai citizens. That's good for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang added that the new measures would make it more convenient to do business in Hong Kong, as mainland business travellers are allowed to stay longer in the city.

    Minimum wage needs to stay, says FTU

Minimum wage needs to stay, says FTU
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750894_1_L_20240428133152.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists have defended the need for the city to have a minimum wage and called for "reasonable and objective" discussion on the issue, after a lawmaker suggested scrapping the basic hourly rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) said the statutory minimum wage, which is currently at HK$40, is essential to protecting employees, in response to comments by Liberal Party legislator Tommy Cheung of the catering sector that the minimum wage could hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, FTU chairman Kingsley Wong said having a minimum wage in place is a common practice worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main purpose of the minimum wage is to be a policy safety net, to ensure grassroots or the most disadvantaged local workers receive appropriate protection," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the issue of the minimum wage, we should be reasonable and objective. Around the world, many countries and regions in the West and Asia have a minimum wage, so the minimum wage must be an appropriate measure then."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also renewed calls for the statutory minimum wage to be reviewed annually, instead of once every two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of a recent string of deadly industrial accidents, the FTU called on various stakeholders such as employers, workers, architects and developers to do their part to ensure occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other demands by the federation ahead of this year's Labour Day included priority be given to local labour, better protection for employees who have to stay online after office hours – also known as “invisible overtime” – and standardised contracts of delivery platform workers.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan says first quarter economic growth is expected to fall within the 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent range. Photo courtesy of the secretary's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750893_1_L_20240428120932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.

    'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'

'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750892_1_L_20240428114518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Concern groups on Sunday said proposed jail sentences for people who fail to report child abuse should be kept in place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill currently making it way through the Legislative Council, professionals such as social workers, teachers and doctors are required to report suspected cases of serious child abuse, and those who fail to comply face a maximum penalty of a three-month prison term and a fine of HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, calling it too harsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Wong from the Commission on Children – a government advisory body on child affairs – said the proposed three-month sentence is reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ultimate objective is to protect the children. And, if we set up the penalty level, which is not high enough, the impact is not great, right?" he told reporters after speaking on a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is why we think that the three-month imprisonment, together with the HK$50,000 fine, is a reasonable threshold, reasonable level of penalty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donna Wong, director of Against Child Abuse, said the proposed penalty should not be lowered, citing the 1,457 child abuse cases reported last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lowering the penalty will hinder the development of the mandatory reporting of the trial bill, because it will lower the effectiveness of the bill and hinder the deterrence effect," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said he believes a balance could be struck between bringing in a deterrent mechanism against the non-reporting of child abuse and addressing concerns of professionals who may be affected by the proposed law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the most important thing is we need deterrence against serious cases. But if the cases are minor, as often is the case, we think we can find a package that is acceptable to both the relevant sectors and those advocating for child protection," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Legco bills committee is scrutinising the proposed legislation.

 Police said on Saturday that they had arrested a truck driver after an accident at about 4pm in which six people were injured.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said a 68-year-old man was driving a minibus along Kam Sheung Road towards Yuen Long, when it was hit by a truck driven by a 56-year-old man.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minibus hit a lamp post and flipped on to its side, and the police said the truck didn't stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the truck driver failed an alcohol test, and was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, drunk driving, reckless driving after a traffic accident and failure to report a traffic accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five women and a man were slightly injured and were taken to hospital.

  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Dane Cheng said he expects more than 800,000 mainland tourists to visit the SAR during the break, but that he doubts the numbers can return to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's unrealistic for Hong Kong to return to the tourist figures of 2018 and 2019. Hongkongers find it difficult to accommodate so many tourists, no matter where they come from. Even when taking public transport like the bus and train, or going shopping, there are many people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to create a good experience for both visitors and locals. Of course visitors hope to have a good experience when they come, and not encounter crowds everywhere they go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that he is in talks with the government and vendors to see whether the revamped Temple Street Night market can be made permanent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the Tourism Board announced that the market, part of the government’s "Night Vibes Hong Kong" campaign to spice up the city’s nightlife, would stay until the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government has announced a series of measures to prepare for the influx of visitors, such as allowing cross-border shuttle buses to increase service frequency and extending the operating hours of the last East Rail Line train to Lo Wu on some days. The MTR also said it would increase train services on seven rail lines, adding a total of 540 train trips during Golden Week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland's Golden Week break runs between May 1 and May 5.

Police Commissioner praises Mong Kok CCTV cameras

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said security cameras, installed in Mong Kok this month, have helped officers detect two serious crimes. Their installation was the first stage of a government plan to install about 2,000 CCTV cameras across Hong Kong this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Siu said the surveillance cameras had been effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In just half a month, we detected two serious crime cases with the help of CCTV cameras. One was related to possessing imitation firearms, and we arrested three men. The other one was a robbery case, and we arrested a man within 24 hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After installing these 15 CCTV cameras, we will see if there’s anything we can improve. We will then install 600 cameras at crime black spots across Hong Kong in the middle of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about privacy concerns, Siu said the Privacy Commissioner had given advice to the government, and that the authorities had also asked an independent consultancy firm to conduct a privacy impact assessment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Services Minister Christopher Hui on Saturday said a recent move by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide more mainland business for Hong Kong is an opportunity for the SAR's financial sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measures, announced earlier this month, include opening up more Hong Kong-based exchange-traded funds for mainland investors and encouraging mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Hui said the stock exchange is currently processing around 100 listing applications from outside Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through the efforts of our stock exchange and other parties, we have been promoting the advantages of our Hong Kong listing platform to different potential issuers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe, with the support of our country's policy, our stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission will continue to work hard and encourage more companies to consider using Hong Kong as a listing platform for their financing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about a rise in bankruptcy petitions, Hui said he believed this was due to a number of reasons, including high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is due to several factors. Of course, some past petitions might come back after the pandemic. At the same time, the economic situation could play a part," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The treasury chief added that officials would continue to monitor the changes in the figures before deciding whether action was needed.

    Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750796_1_L_20240427112917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Saturday said the operating costs for light public flats should not be compared with traditional public housing units, as the government prepares to take applications for the first of the flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to a question on an RTHK radio show, she said the new flats have a different set of facilities so an exact comparison cannot be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional public flats, the operating cost only includes about HK$500 for cleaning and security, and about HK$400 for maintenance and repair work, so it's a total of about HK$1,000," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But there are additional social welfare facilities for light public flats, and there are social welfare organisations providing services for residents. For example, there may be a shared living room for residents, and activities for them. Like transitional housing, there are shops, restaurants, or laundry services for residents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of the modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address to fill the short-term gap in public housing supply, will be completed in Yuen Long in the first quarter of next year. About 2,100 will be available with applications starting in the next few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said she was confident that 30,000 light public housing units would be completed by 2027 at the latest.

    Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister

Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750786_2_L_20240427135328.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said the public was adapting quickly to the plastic-free scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban started on Monday, and restaurants are now barred from selling and using plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told a radio programme that authorities had visited about 1,700 retail and catering premises in the past week and almost all of the large chains, and about half of the smaller restaurants, had changed to non-plastic utensils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of effectiveness, many chain restaurants told us that about 60 to 70 percent of customers, who bought takeaway food, didn't need disposable utensils. This phenomenon is very good because one of the aims of the plastic ban scheme was for people to bring their own utensils," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A chain supermarket was found to be selling sushi in paper boxes this week, with people describing it as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said it's unreasonable and unnecessary for supermarkets to use non-plastic packaging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Supermarkets may allow customers to eat at their tables. People normally think it's considered as dine-in, but in this situation, supermarkets expected customers to take out their food. In reality, a lot of people do take away their food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When supermarkets pack their food, they won't know whether customers will choose to take out or dine in... We think that treating this as takeaway is appropriate, according to the regulations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the quality of non-plastic utensils, Tse said the ban had just begun, and he believed that restaurants would be able to choose better substitutes later on.

    Non-plastic prices to fall as use increases: minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan (right) also said authorities must find reliable alternatives before expanding a ban on single-use plastics. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750777_1_L_20240427080634.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment chief Tse Chin-wan has stressed that a ban on single-use plastics is not meant to trouble people, saying prices for alternatives will go down further when they become more common.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect on April 22, prohibiting the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse told RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme, which was broadcast on Saturday, that the policy is not intended to make people's lives more difficult but to regulate plastics at source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those disposable tableware, if you switch to the alternatives, the difference is actually very small, usually one or two cents to a maximum of 50 cents for the whole package. Therefore, it's not very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that as more and more will be used in society, the price will go down further. People's behaviour will drive the development of the alternatives, as well as drive down the price of those alternatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said authorities must find reliable substitutes before expanding the scope of scheme, as he ruled out imposing a blanket ban on plastic products because their use is too widespread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not going to ban the use of all plastics at once. That is not possible... We start with those which we already have readily available and mature alternatives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the postponed municipal solid waste charging scheme, the environment minister said there are proven effects of the policy in Seoul, where the amount to garbage produced was cut by 60 to 70 percent in about five to 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government pushed back the implementation of the waste charging to August, while it held trials for the scheme at more than a dozen premises this month.

    Govt lowers Sha Tin Trunk Road estimated cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has put forward minor tweaks to the planned construction of a new road in Sha Tin in hopes of cutting the estimated cost of the project by five percent to HK$6.81 billion amid criticism of its hefty price tag.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a revised funding request for the Trunk Road T4, the administration said the changes would not affect the functionality of the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to concerns currently about the situation of public finances, we tried to reduce the cost of this project as much as possible," the Legco paper wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to win the support of lawmakers so that the project can be carried out in a timely manner and avoid delaying yet again the long-term development of New Territories East and the Northern Metropolis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities last month withdrew its application to the Legislative Council of more than HK$7.1 billion in funding for the planned T4 project, which connects major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River, as critics questioned whether the scheme is worth the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cut cost, the government said it will switch to using traditional materials to build noise barriers for the project, which in turn is expected to save HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will not affect the function of noise barriers. Currently, traditional materials are commonly used in other construction projects," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other changes include scrapping a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reducing the number of elevators at footbridges to further shave off around HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to discuss the revised funding request during a Finance Committee meeting next week.

    ICAC sees 30 percent jump in property management cases

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday said it received 30 percent more complaints relating to the property management sector in 2023, compared to the year before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it received 236 reports, up from 182 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Corinna Wong, the ICAC’s director of community relations, said many of the reports last year were linked to repairs and maintenance contracts, with allegations that some were awarded through bribery or that they came with exaggerated price tags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complainants alleged that some property management firms took bribes from jobseekers, or fabricated duty records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said there were 51 such corruption reports in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said while there may be "rotten apples" in the industry, the increase in complaints does not mean that the sector has become more corrupt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes after we investigated corruption cases, and they were widely reported by the press, members of the public may become aware of that particular case and then may come forward to report to us similar cases," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the property management sector, after the ICAC operations department discovered several cases last year, there was a slight increase in the corruption cases we received."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft watchdog said it is working with the Property Management Services Authority to offer training for companies and workers to enhance integrity standards across the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority’s vice-chairperson, Eddie Hui, noted that property management workers must now obtain a licence, and that all of them will need to receive training in areas including anti-corruption awareness starting in 2025.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they had enhanced enforcement to combat traffic violations associated with taxis, tour buses and illegal cabs at renowned tourist sites as part of preparations for the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing near the Peak Tram station in Central, Inspector Lai Cheuk-fung said during the first three months of the year, police had received 23 complaints about taxis, with grievances about over charging commonly cited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai said officers would enhance their enforcement efforts starting from Wednesday this week to May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police would also strengthen education by introducing "taxi ambassadors" to provide taxi-related information to travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from enforcement, we would like to introduce a multi-agency approach to tackle this problem. Apart from tackling the problem in Hong Kong, we would like to consolidate Hong Kong's place as an international tourist destination. And this is our ultimate goal," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, senior investigator at the Travel Industry Authority, Mark Cheng, said authorities would beef up their manpower to monitor famous tourist spots and border control points, as around 680 mainland tour groups are expected to visit Hong Kong during Golden Week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they arrested 61 people, including five minors, in the past month for allegedly selling drugs online.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the suspects, aged between 14 and 59, are suspected of involvement in 43 cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they seized 128 kilogrammes of drugs, including cannabis buds, cocaine and magic mushrooms, as well as electronic cigarette pods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hauls were worth about HK$38 million in total, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said drug syndicates have created channels and groups on Telegram to sell cannabis products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Syndicates imported a large amount of cannabis oil from overseas countries to Hong Kong. They then processed the cannabis oil and mixed it into chocolates, candies and cookies, and sold them on social media platforms. In terms of appearance, they looked the same as normal products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charm added that some electronic cigarette pods have been found to contain etomidate, warning that even a small amount of the controlled drug can cause death.

Man arrested for having firearms without a licence

<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Friday said they arrested a man on suspicion of possessing firearms without a licence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers found 18 guns, 11 knives, and four daggers at a self-storage facility in Sha Tin, and arrested the 67-year-old suspect on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Superintendent Cheung Ting-fung said the man had previously held licences for various types of guns, but these were revoked in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said it is suspected that all the firearms found at the storage facility this week were obtained illegally from overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the case was not related to the social unrest in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, we do not have any evidence showing that the arrested person is connected to any previous riot or violent cases. We tend to believe that this arrested person is just a firearms fanatic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case will be heard at the Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts on Friday afternoon.

 Chief Executive John Lee said cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanghai was entering a new phase as the CE met with the city's mayor for a major conference on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the sixth plenary session of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Co-operation Conference, Lee said the two cities would sign 20 cooperation documents and reach consensus on 65 projects in areas such as innovation technology, industrial development, digital economy and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the first meeting in 2003, the two cities have been engaging in more frequent exchanges... Hong Kong has become one of the major export markets and also the largest source of foreign investment into Shanghai," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng said these exchanges created opportunities and built a win-win situation for the two cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We sincerely hope that the two cities can take the opportunity of signing a new round of cooperation documents to integrate our development strategies comprehensively, create highlights for our cooperation and together push Hong Kong-Shanghai cooperation to a new phase," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong Yin Zonghua, Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan, and Financial Secretary Paul Chan, were among the other leaders and officials at the meeting.

 Heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong on Friday with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning just after 8.30 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber signal means that heavy rain, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour, has fallen and is likely to continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory warned of flooding in some low-lying and poorly-drained areas, while the Labour Department told construction workers and contractors to pay attention to electrical safety in the workplace.

    Trial and error needed for plastic alternatives: CEO

    <![CDATA[<img alt="George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes and it was the same for environmentally-friendly alternatives. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750618_1_L_20240426092723.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of one of the companies, invited by the government to meet the media and introduce their alternatives to plastic disposable tableware, says a period of trial and error is still needed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes when it came to heat, strength and storage and it was the same for their environmentally-friendly alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a point I would like to share. We all know humans have been using plastics for the last 30 years, 40 years - we have all experience," he said. "Different plastics are made for different purposes. For example, a plastic container for sandwiches is not the same formulation as a plastic container for oil or soup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said that with the introduction of new plant-fibre containers and cutlery, consumers and users needed to focus on what alternative products met their needs rather than just focusing on price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Department put on the media event as it launched the Green Tableware Platform to help people and businesses find alternatives to plastic utensils. The online platform provides a list of suppliers for the environmentally-friendly products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Thursday condemned a vote by the European Parliament critical of Hong Kong’s national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said it “strongly opposed the so-called resolution adopted by the European Parliament against Hong Kong, and strongly condemned the Parliament for making baseless allegations about Hong Kong and smearing the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said that the SAR had a constitutional duty to safeguard national security, adding that all sovereign states had an inherent right to safeguard their security in accordance with international law and the UN charter. He noted that many other countries had also enacted national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the Parliament has demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards,” the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman noted that both the NSL and the Ordinance clearly specify that rights and freedoms under the Basic Law and international covenants are to be protected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The European Parliament neglected the relevant provisions and lashed out wantonly, fully exposing its malicious intentions," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must once again emphasise that the Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against external forces that endanger our national security, acting like a sturdier door and a more effective door lock to defend our home,” the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges the European Parliament to stop smearing and interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China and ensure that their remarks concerning the NSL and the Ordinance are fair and just, and stop making scaremongering remarks.”

    'Mainland Citybus drivers may affect locals' jobs'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Unionists say they do not wish to resort to taking industrial action. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750543_1_L_20240425190732.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport unionists on Thursday spoke out against a decision by Citybus to import 20 drivers from the mainland, saying they are worried that more will come in the future and affect the jobs of local drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citybus said the first five of the 20 approved bus captains who arrive here next month will take a driving test before they’re allowed to start work, adding that they will only work on non-franchised routes, such as services for employees and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Motor Transport Workers General Union said it is worried that this is just the beginning, and that Citybus will bring in more non-local workers to operate on franchised routes down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, noted that the hourly salary of a mainland bus captain is slightly lower than that of a local, and expressed worries that local drivers may get a pay cut in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung Nuen-yui from the union's Citybus section said the company should offer better remuneration packages for local recruits before importing drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are new recruits, but not many of them stay in the company. This shows that there are issues with the pay, welfare, shift arrangements, working location and hours. I hope the company will solve these problems before looking into other solutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group added that it is arranging a meeting with Citybus and the authorities, and it does not wish to resort to taking industrial action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citybus, for its part, said it prioritises local workers and offers a bonus exclusively to new local employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department also said in response that it has taken into account the welfare of local drivers before allowing Citybus to import drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said the bus operator has proven that it was not able to hire suitable local drivers, adding that these imported drivers are not allowed to run franchised routes.

'Lo Wu will be busy during Golden Week'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Immigration officials on Thursday said they expect Lo Wu will be the busiest border crossing during the mainland's "Golden Week" holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee projected almost six million arrivals and departures for the week, with some 800,000 mainland tourists expected to come to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said Labour Day on May 1 is tipped to be the busiest day, with arrivals and departures reaching one million at land checkpoints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that between April 30 and May 5, an average of around 200,000 rail journeys a day are expected through Lo Wu, and 170,000 via Lok Ma Chau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An average of 130,000 journeys a day are expected for the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department's boundary division commander, Ng Hoi-ka, said travellers are advised to use the department's mobile app for real-time border traffic information, so they can see how busy the different checkpoints are.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also called on travellers to avoid crossing the border during peak hours.
