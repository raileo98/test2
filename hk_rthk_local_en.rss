<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday led a number of senior officials to attend the Hong Kong-Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He told delegates with the SAR government enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law this year, Hong Kong could now focus on economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the areas of co-operation, the SAR government said it was studying with its Shenzhen counterparts on ways to build a clinical trial cooperative platform within the Lok Ma Chau Loop area, also known as the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it would set up a clinical trial institute in the Loop area by the end of this year, with the aim of providing trials for the entire Greater Bay Area population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said Hong Kong and its bay area counterparts would work to build an international medical innovation hub in the long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute was first mentioned in Chief Executive John Lee's policy address last year.

    'Harsher punishments over medical incidents needed'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical sector lawmaker on Friday called for harsher punishments for senior managers responsible for medical incidents at public hospitals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority set up a review committee earlier this month to look at the operations and incident response policies at public hospitals following a series of blunders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmaker David Lam, who is one of the committee members, said senior managers should be held accountable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If it's just about having senior management to come to meet with the press, bow their head, express their concern for the affected families, and deduct some bonus or welfare benefits to the staff concerned, that's not enough. We should not just shift the responsibility to frontline staff," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review committee will examine existing mechanisms to monitor performance and look at systems to manage risk and accountability, as well as incident response policies at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will submit its recommendations to the authority's governing board within three months.

    Tai Lam Tunnel toll plan sparks debate in legislature

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it has reservations about making the Tai Lam Tunnel free. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761327_1_20240712160232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Whether the Tai Lam Tunnel should be free at certain times was up for debate among lawmakers on Friday, with the government expressing reservations about the suggestion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Most legislators agreed, however, that the administration should charge time-varying tolls after it takes control of the New Territories tunnel next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature earlier, officials outlined three different pricing scenarios, including two fixed toll proposals and a third with different fares for peak, regular and off-peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed staggered tolls, private car drivers would pay HK$45, HK$35 or HK$20 depending on the time of day. Taxi drivers would pay HK$30 at all times, while commercial vehicles would be charged HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Chun-san, the undersecretary for transport and logistics, said the government has reservations about making the tunnel free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reduction is not acceptable for the point of view of the use of public money and traffic management. We have to make sure that the traffic is smooth, and to maintain the tunnel, we need to charge a toll," Liu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some lawmakers, including New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip, said they believe fees are necessary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to let people know the infrastructure is a massive public investment and we should make the best use and do not abuse any infrastructure. We have to let people know that resources are valuable. So I'm against an infrastructure service free of charge," Ip said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Edward Lau of the DAB said he would not support any of the three pricing scenarios put forward by the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the new tunnels... all of these are offered for use free of charge. Why do you adopt a different principle for the Tai Lam Tunnel?" Lau asked.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As part of the "100% Doraemon & Friends Tour (Hong Kong)", ticket holders can view an expansive indoors and outdoors exhibition at K11 Musea in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Those that do not have tickets can view a Doraemon exhibition at the Avenue of Stars for free, where there will be 34 1:1 life-sized sculptures of different versions of Doraemon along with 10 friends of the beloved blue cartoon character.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from the exhibitions, other activities include "The Doraemon Drone Show", which will return to Victoria Harbour on July 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on that day, "100% Friends-Calling Bell" themed trains will park at Sha Tin MTR Station and at the Light Rail's Siu Hong stop so fans can take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Kevin Yeung, said he believes this will be a good large-scale event for Hong Kong, adding that Doraemon is a cherished part of many Hongkongers' childhood memories.

    Govt urged to raise number of hire-car permits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers discussed a government proposal to regulate online car-hailing platforms. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761307_1_20240712125139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have urged the government to increase the number of permits for ride-hailing services, saying authorities have to ensure healthy competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of permits is currently capped at 1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting on Friday, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the threshold to apply for a permit is too stringent, and that online ride-hailing services are a rising trend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another legislator, Chan Pui-leung, said the government should not keep online car-hailing services “on a tight leash”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to uphold one principle – regulation is meant to promote healthy growth of the industry,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Chan Siu-hung, for his part, said regulating such platforms should come hand-in-hand with issuing more hire-car permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If [the administration] is just regulating the platforms without issuing licences, and if only taxis are able to provide personalised point-to-point business, then people would be discouraged from taking taxis because of their poor service quality,” the legislator said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we don’t have enough competition in the market, people and tourists will be the losers… We don’t want to have an impression that the government is tilting in favour of the taxi industry.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport chief Lam Sai-hung said the government's regulation plan does not favour the taxi trade, and the administration will “listen to opinions and look at data” when drawing up its legislative proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to ensure the safety of passengers and their rights, and also have to pay attention to the healthy development of the transport industry. I don’t think the two are mutually exclusive,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we want to see a healthy development of the industry, and given the two broad principles, we need to strike a balance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is planning to regulate online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate. Anyone found to be involved in providing illegal services could have their driving licence suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities will conduct a study to review passenger demand before presenting a legislative proposal next year.

    Lawmakers divided on penalty for ignoring child abuse

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There are divided views on penalties for professionals who fail to report child abuse cases, with one lawmaker saying tougher punishments are needed to boost the deterrent effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien made the comment a day after Legco passed the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, requiring 25 types of workers such as doctors and teachers to report suspected cases of serious harm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who fail to do so will face a maximum punishment of three months in prison and a HK$50,000 fine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tien, who cast the only abstention vote, said on an RTHK programme that he thinks the jail term should be extended to a year instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In today's Hong Kong, a maximum penalty of one year in jail applies to most laws... What penalties are less than a year nowadays? Only for very trivial offences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seeing a child being continuously sexually assaulted and not saying anything is outrageous. When I think of the three-month jail term, I have nothing to say."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking on the same programme, Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang said he believes the three-month maximum jail term is sufficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Do higher penalties mean better social effects? I don't think so. A one-year jail term will make everyone feel scared and suspicious," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who chaired the bills committee for the new legislation, said he hopes professionals will actively follow up on child abuse cases.

    Retail sector is recovering: Algernon Yau

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau says there has been a gradual rebound in the local retail sector, with more stores opening across the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current government term, Yau was asked if there’s been a wave of shop closures in Hong Kong amid a drop in retail sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce and economic development chief said that while the government does not have statistics on store closures, recent surveys have pointed to an improvement in retail occupancy rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said figures indicated that the number of vacant stores dropped from 18.3 percent in the third quarter of 2020 to around 6.6 percent recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can see that the situation is improving gradually,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But some people may say, there are still a lot of vacant shops. Well, a change in the commercial environment as well as people’s spending behaviour may mean that some retailers no longer need so many physical stores.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yau said there’s also been an increase in the number of mainland and overseas companies setting up shop in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the first half of this year, InvestHK helped 322 firms set up business in the SAR, compared to 383 companies in the whole of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this indicates that non-local companies are confident in Hong Kong and are hoping to use the SAR as a stepping stone to enter the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said the implementation of a real-name registration system for SIM cards has proven effective in combating telephone scams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that as of late May, telecom companies had rejected around 2.4 million SIM card applications and terminated almost 1.8 million unregistered cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his bureau has been working closely with the police to block suspicious calls, adding that more work will be done in this area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A documentary produced jointly by China Media Group (CMG) and Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) will showcase the unique charm of Hong Kong's culinary culture to the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a launch ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the documentary "Taste of Hong Kong" is an important milestone as it is the first joint production of the two broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said CMG's cooperation with RTHK has supported the SAR in various ways, including the donation of a number of high-quality programmes for RTHK for broadcast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cooperation has not only further enhanced Hong Kong people's understanding of the country, but also promoted the city's integration into the country's overall development, while promoting Chinese culture to the international community, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Wang Xiaozhen, Vice President of CMG, said the group has fulfilled its duties and mission as part of state media by working closely with the Hong Kong government to tell the city's story, promote quality development and showcase the charm of Chinese culture. He said it has achieved a number of fruitful results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said he hoped the documentary will encourage more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong.
  <br/>

  He added that RTHK will play an active role by working closely with mainland broadcast media, while acting as a bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ninety percent of this year’s DSE candidates hoped to continue their education in Hong Kong, according to a survey conducted by the Quality People Resources Limited between November and January this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It polled 3,236 DSE takers from 41 secondary schools across Hong Kong, aiming to examine students’ preferences in continuing education and taking up employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s director Edward Chan on Thursday said students hoped to stay in the city mostly due to convenience and the fact that they view Hong Kong as their home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For local students, convenience, parent’s expectations, or scholarship, sponsorship, or Hong Kong is their home…[these are why they would prefer to stay in Hong Kong],” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four percent of candidates hoped to continue their education on the mainland, and six percent overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese University and Polytechnic University were the most popular choices among students, with 22.4 percent and 16.4 percent of students hoping to be admitted respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nursing was the most desirable subject among students at 13.5 percent, followed by education at 12.44 percent and psychology at 12.41 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This echoes with the most preferred job industry among students, with education at 16.4 percent and nursing at 13.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that students tend to select subjects according to their DSE results and personal interests, followed by industry trends related to their preferred majors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study also saw an increase in preference in selecting Hong Kong as the future working location for graduates, with a rise from 76 percent last year to 81 percent this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that personal interests, at 58.9 percent of candidates, remained the top priority among students this year when choosing their career, followed by salary and benefits at 54.9 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The living cost in Hong Kong is very high. Students can see the high cost of rent, transport and food, therefore they will consider this first [when choosing their subjects]. Therefore students are indoctrinated with the thought that they will need to acquire a certain salary level to live in Hong Kong,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said it would consider the increase of university tuition fees starting from the 2025/26 academic year for their survey next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50,800 DSE candidates will receive their exam results next Wednesday.

    Police to use Chinese pistols instead of US revolvers
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they were replacing US-made revolvers with pistols manufactured on the mainland to meet their operational needs, with officers expected to use the new handguns as soon as July 25.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two Chinese-made pistols, CF98-A and CS/LP5, will replace existing service revolvers from the US firm Smith & Wesson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of officers to receive training includes those from the tactical unit, emergency unit, quick reaction force and crime wing headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have our established procurement procedures. To review the police uniform, accoutrement, as well as equipment, is a regular [task] that the police force has been doing," said superintendent Ko Cheuk-hang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To choose a good equipment we rely on a couple of very important principles, first of all the effectiveness and the long-term sustainability. And apart of this major principle, we need to make sure all these equipment could serve the purpose as well as meet our weapon handling standard requirement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the new pistol is equipped with a manual safety catch and can be reloaded faster compared with the existing revolvers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko added the force would be trained to use the new handguns in phases, but did not comment on the timeline for a full transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Vickers, the CEO of risk consultancy Steve Vickers and Associates, told RTHK that the move to replace the handguns was not unexpected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not surprising given that the old Smith & Wesson revolvers are no longer being manufactured, and it's actually quite difficult to get spare parts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously the US-China relations are pretty poor. There have already been restrictions on both the Americans and the EU countries supplying weapons to the Hong Kong police. So it made sense to, for both historical reasons and practical reasons and political reasons, to move to a PRC-manufactured firearm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former senior police officer added that the transition could take years, depending on the delivery and training schedules.

    Legco passes child abuse reporting law
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco passes child abuse reporting law" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761185_1_20240711163026.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it will work on finding additional care places for abused children, as more cases are expected to come to light in the city thanks to a new law passed by Legco on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill sets out how 25 types of professionals, including doctors, social workers and teachers, will face a maximum punishment of three months in prison and a HK$50,000 fine if they fail to tell the authorities when they suspect a child is suffering physical, psychological or sexual abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill was introduced last year following a series of abuse scandals which sparked calls for more protection for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seventy-nine lawmakers voted in favour of the new law, with no opposing votes and one abstention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the legislation will come into effect 18 months after it is gazetted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're going to make use of the coming 18 months to make sure that everything is ready so that by the time the legislation comes into effect, all the professions who are required under the law to make mandatory reporting will get the necessary training," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're also at the same time putting in place additional facilities and homes to cater for the increasing cases of reporting. And also, we're going to step up our efforts in terms of promotion and publicity, and make sure that we all work together for the welfare and betterment of our children.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Thursday's debate on the bill, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien proposed a higher maximum punishment of one year in prison for those who fail to report abuse suspicions, saying the three-month term doesn't reflect the seriousness of such an offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Did you ask the children’s thoughts? Did you only ask the professionals’ thoughts? We have one million children in Hong Kong. I think we won’t have one million professionals,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tien also argued that the courts rarely hand out the maximum sentence possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said the penalty level is the same as for other mandatory reporting laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These include the reporting of drug trafficking, terrorism, and organised crime. The government believes the deterrent effect of the penalty is already sufficient and appropriate to the crimes involved,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, meanwhile, lauded the government for adding more exemptions and immunity clauses in the bill, as well as for forming consultant groups to create a “report manual”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tik said these moves had addressed concerns raised by professionals regarding the bill.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are investigating an alleged case of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice in which a 44-year-old man was found dead at a public housing unit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a 59-year-old woman reported to police on Monday that her husband was found collapsed inside the unit in Fortune Estate in Cheung Sha Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ambulance personnel found the man lying in the living room of the unit. He was rushed to Caritas Medical Centre and was certified dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 22-year-old stepson has been charged with one count of manslaughter while the 33-year-old stepdaughter and wife were each charged with one count of perverting the course of justice.

    Govt urged to cap number of ride-hailing platforms

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick on Thursday called on the government to limit the number of online ride-hailing platforms available in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature earlier this week, officials said they plan to regulate online ride-hailing services through a licensing system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Yick said the authorities should issue a licence to only one or two platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a number of these online car-hailing platforms available in Hong Kong. Now if you look around the other cities in the world, some of them have already controlled the number of these kinds of platforms available for the citizens to use," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The beauty of having a limited number of platforms, because the possibility of matching the services will be much better than if you split into a multi-number of these kinds of platforms. I think this is a very simple concept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yick also said that the drivers of private vehicles offering ride-hailing services through such platforms should obtain a licence, otherwise they and their passengers would not be covered by insurance.

    High-potential swimmers won't be hindered: Ronnie Wong

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, Ronnie Wong, on Thursday said the association would give special consideration to high-potential young swimmers to participate in races.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came amid calls to revise the rules for competition qualifications over accusations that some swimmers had been discriminated against due to the club they belonged to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media reported that a nine-year-old was denied entry to compete at the 2024 open championships in Hong Kong due to the ranking of his swimming club, despite the swimmer meeting the qualifying time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Wong said the association would not hinder swimmers with potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to take care of a lot of clubs. Under some special circumstances if the swimmers are really outstanding, but the clubs they belong to are not qualified for open race, we will consider allowing the swimmers to compete. But this is only on an individual consideration," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told the same radio programme that the association should remove higher-ranked clubs, that have been inactive for two or three years, from affiliation, allowing lower-ranked clubs to move up and take their place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because according to the current rules of the swimming association, if a club does not cancel its affiliation, there will be no room for lower-ranked clubs to advance. If there are clubs which don't have any activity, and remain in the same position, there is no chance for lower-ranked clubs to advance," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said the association should enhance transparency by disclosing the number of inactive clubs and ensure fair handling of club rankings.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Wednesday said it was investigating suspected corruption involving frontline staff from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said the case relates to procurement projects under HK$50,000 at public hospitals and possible violations of section 4 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight people were arrested. They have since been released pending further investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC added that more than 10 others were interviewed under caution, among them EMSD staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the EMSD said it will fully cooperate with the investigation and will not tolerate any illegal acts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to section 4 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, government officers must not solicit or accept any advantage as an inducement or reward.

    Legco passes bill to bring in non-HK trained dentists

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Legislative Council on Wednesday passed legislation allowing non-locally trained dentists to practise in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dentists Registration (Amendment) Bill also requires local dentistry graduates to intern at specified institutions for a year before registration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the bill's debate in Legco, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau called it a "historic moment" for the city's dental profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the most comprehensive amendment to the Dentists Registration Ordinance in Hong Kong in over 60 years," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that the Department of Health will start hiring non-locally trained dentists and aims to have the first batch arrive here in the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said there's a shortage of dentists in Hong Kong, with the shortfall expected to persist until 2040 before easing slightly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also reiterated that the one-year internship requirement has nothing to do with a shortage of dentists in the public sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if the Department of Health achieves zero vacancy through local and non-local recruitment in future, the government will undertake to arrange internships for all local dental graduates to enhance their skills. This will not be affected by manpower supply or demand," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The internship arrangement will apply to local dental students graduating in the summer of 2025 and onwards.

  Hang Seng University conducted a survey involving around 1,200 passengers, including both local residents and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's findings revealed that 57 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with the city’s taxi services, showing a slight uptick from 55 percent last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK after a press briefing at the Legislative Council, Ryan Wong, who chairs the taxi council, said there was room for improvement in taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We suggest the government consider it mandatory to install a central cloud-based camera system on taxis in order to monitor the driver's behaviour as well as to prevent illegal acts. And this is also supported by the general public, according to the survey result in this round," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, who chairs Legco’s transport panel, and transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick, also expressed their support for the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in taxis, citing similar measures already in place on the mainland and in Macau.

    New sweatsuit helps remove sweat faster: researchers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Polytechnic University say they have developed a new type of smart sweatsuit that helps athletes remove sweat faster.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "iActive" garment has a small device dubbed "artificial sweat glands” installed on the back. It uses low-voltage electricity to collect sweat and move it away from the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Shou Dahua, who led the research, said the device is safe to wear as it only has a low voltage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the idea for the sweatsuit came from how trees transport water through their roots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We collect the water via the root-like structure, and then we dissipate sweat on the bottom area using a low, safe voltage… The sweat dissipation rate is three times faster than the maximum human sweating rate,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition, our sportswear is 60 percent lighter and 50 percent less clingy when soaked, in comparison to conventional sportswear.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides athletes, the garment would also be suitable for outdoor workers, medical professionals and firefighters, Shou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sweatsuit can also be controlled by a smartphone app, allowing people to adjust the speed of sweat removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The research team said it has conducted various tests to ensure safety, finding that the sweat removal function doesn't deteriorate over time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Let's say after 500 laundry tests or after 100 hours of continuous use, the difference of sweat dissipation rate is quite small, less than five percent,” Shou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the team is in talks with different sports brands to commercialise the product and aims to price it at HK$800 per garment.

    'Companies earmark more than 4 percent on training'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local companies were planning to allocate, on average, 4.3 percent of their annual budget towards employee training and development -- the highest percentage since 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was one of the findings from a survey by the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management which polled 108 companies across 20 industries with over 65,000 full-time employees between March and May this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banking and financial services topped actual spending on employee training at 6.2 percent, followed by the manufacturing sector at 5.8 percent and the hospitality sector at 4.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Average annual training hours per employee in 2023 remained similar to 2022 at 17.3 hours, with 76 percent of companies using webinars or virtual classrooms for training and development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey found companies were looking to strengthen employees’ interpersonal and customer service skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “From the macro environment, there’s an urgent need to enhance customer service to attract customers, to retain customers because customer service is one of the core committed edge to outperform the competitors,” said the institute's chairman of learning and development committee Chester Tsang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding artificial intelligence (AI) usage, 77 percent of the surveyed companies allowed the use of AI, with 28 percent of employers providing relevant tools to their employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute suggested companies implement measures to boost employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates as the city faced a talent shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include providing advancement opportunities, identifying and nurturing potential successors, and providing relevant training programmes to employees to bridge skill gaps.

    Appointments underway for new mainland travel permit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Applicants can look for available timeslots on China Travel Service's website. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760997_1_20240710121725.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In-person appointments began on Wednesday at China Travel Service centres across Hong Kong for people applying for new mainland travel permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The card allows permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens to travel to the mainland for up to 90 days at a time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man named Johan arrived early at one travel centre on Hong Kong Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just to make it easier to go to China because so far, I've had to apply for a visa, and the visa process is quite time-consuming, so this just makes things a lot easier," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Ambos said he travels to the mainland for work several times a week and the new permit will make his trips easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I work with factories in China so every week I'm in [mainland] China two or three or four days. It's a great place to go buy products for different markets of the world. It's got good pricing and good-quality products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now the rest of my company are all locals...and this card just makes it easier to go in and out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a woman surnamed Manna told RTHK she needed to make another appointment as she was missing a document from the Immigration Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The applying process is really easy actually, it's just an online submission. But I didn't know that I needed to get something from Tseung Kwan O [immigration office], that approval letter. So I have to go back and get it, and then actually I have to make another appointment," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that was not clear for me, because they said to get the documents, but I didn't get what the document was... But it's okay, three of my family members will be applying, so I can give the message to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Hart said he found the centre to be busy, but said that was understandable given it was the first day of appointments.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government was actively pursuing membership in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a summit organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Lee said the SAR could contribute to the regional economy by becoming a RCEP member.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can offer RCEP member enterprises a wider range of high-quality service options, including supply chain management services, and financial and professional services," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will assist them to better connect and leverage the limitless opportunities brought by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, promoting economic development and innovation in the RCEP member countries and the overall region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the current government administration had been seeking support from RCEP members by making overseas visits to regions such as the Middle East and ASEAN countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong offered a safe and convenient business environment for mainland companies to expand globally, and for foreign companies to enter the mainland market.

    First choice allocations lower in scramble for schools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Education Bureau says 91 percent of primary six pupils got a secondary school place among their top three choices. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760957_1_20240710093545.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Parents choosing a secondary school for their child may have been too optimistic about securing their top choice in this year's secondary school allocation, which was announced on Tuesday. That's according to Rizwan Ullah, who is a secondary school vice-principal and a Kowloon City district councillor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Ullah said an overestimation of emigration may have been a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the number this year, one thing that could explain the drop is probably due to parents being a little bit aggressive with their strategy in finding a school for their children, believing the decline in student population will bring benefits to them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said with the children from the mainland talent scheme and with many parents competing for the same spot, this had led to a decrease in the percentage of children getting into their first choice of school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Education Bureau said 62 percent secured their first choice via central allocation, down from 66 percent last year, and the lowest since 2020. However 91 percent of the around 51,000 primary six pupils did get a place among their top three choices
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with some children in tears about not getting into one of their top three choices of school, Ullah said there were no bad schools and that parents shouldn't put too much pressure on their kids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The children are upset partly because we have created that expectation - if you don't get these three then the child will feel bad. It's just like running in a race, it's the first three. If you're the fourth, you don't get a medal," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But actually, if you look, many students who go to these different schools, they do well in different aspects because we talk about whole-person development and we look at the healthy development of the child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said it was therefore important not to create too many expectations for children, as the child may have some hidden talent. He said it was just one part of the education process and there were other elements, going forward, like university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah also said parents should pick a school, which they believe matches their child's ability, so their child will have a higher chance of getting in.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday held a flag presentation ceremony for the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics ahead of the start of the Games later this month, with Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan announcing higher rewards to further motivate athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I’m glad to learn about the Jockey Club Athlete Incentive Awards Scheme, which will increase the reward for athletes. There will be a 20 percent increase in cash incentives in total compared with the last Olympics. For example, the reward for an individual gold medallist will be raised to HK$6 million. This is a great way to motivate our athletes to strive for better results,” he said at the ceremony at the government headquarters in Tamar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also revealed that due to the rising temperatures in Paris, the administration plans to provide air conditioners for athletes competing there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The order's been placed, the equipment's on its way… I'm going there on July 22nd, and I anticipate that all our rooms [will] have the air conditioning,” said Brian Stevenson, Chef de Mission for the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending a delegation of about 90 people to Paris. Among them are 35 athletes, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Épée fencer Vivian Kong, who narrowly missed out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is now heading to Paris as the world number one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said her mindset has changed since the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the biggest difference between these three years is that Tokyo gave me a lot of time to reflect on why I want to train, why I want to become better, why I want to win, because it doesn't seem to matter if people aren't healthy, if people aren't happy. There are more important things than sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think this time in Paris we can really enjoy sports... Hopefully everyone's healthy again and that it gives more purpose and motivation for me to do well.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For veteran swimmer Camille Cheng, this will be her third Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her family will be in Paris to see her in action in the Games for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think about this time of the season as really the fun part of the season. We've put in the hard work. It's all about the small details, fine-tuning things, focusing on recovery," Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And really, I think more than anything, it's about mentally so that you're in a happy place, that you're surrounded by positive energy... because for me I believe that a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sprinter Felix Diu made the final cut to the Olympics through a wild-card. The 100m specialist and first-time Olympian said his goal is to achieve a personal best at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My expectation for the Olympics is to get a [personal best time] for like 10.3 or 10.2 seconds,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Wai-fung, another Olympic debutant, secured Hong Kong's first-ever Taekwondo Olympic qualification. While excited about that, he said he feels the pressure of representing all the Taekwondo enthusiasts in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes to bring home a medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will be held from July 26 to August 11.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man from Hong Kong has died while climbing Mount Fuji in Japan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to Japanese media, the 58-year-old man was found unconscious while climbing the mountain from Yamanashi prefecture on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was pronounced dead later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said it'd received a request for assistance. It has initiated follow-up actions through the commissioner's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Chinese embassy in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added it has provided appropriate advice and assistance to the family members of the victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japanese media quoted local police as saying this was the first death reported since the opening of the 3,776m mountain to hikers this summer.

 Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong (ACGHK) organisers on Tuesday said they hope to avoid overcrowding issues at this year's event by charging separately for entry to the cosplay and exhibition areas, rather than issuing all-in-one tickets as they have in the past.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 2,000 cosplayers are expected to join the five-day event from July 26 at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ACGHK's chief executive officer, Leung Chung-pun, said more than 140 exhibitors will take part in the fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Apart from Hong Kong citizens being the mainstream, we welcomed visitors from more than 30 countries and regions [last year]... ACGHK has a very stable foundation to continue developing into the most influential anime exhibition in the whole of Asia, or even the world,” Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticket details will be announced at a later date.

 Security Secretary Chris Tang said on Tuesday that the government has been discussing with Shenzhen officials a plan to speed up immigration clearance procedures at two border crossings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A "collaborative inspection and joint clearance" arrangement at Huanggang Port and Sha Tau Kok will see e-channels and counters of both jurisdictions set up side by side, with travellers only having to have their documents checked once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrangement has been in place on the border between Macau and Zhuhai since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of a review of his bureau's work in the past year, Tang also noted in a social media post that since last week, Hong Kong permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens have been able to apply for five-year travel permits for the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He further noted that in May, mainland authorities expanded a travel scheme for mainland professionals from six industries to visit Hong Kong.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760851_1_20240709125404.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mainland's central bank on Tuesday announced that global investors will be given more choice of collateral for trading government bonds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will allow offshore investors to use onshore bonds under Northbound Bond Connect as margin collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bonds are limited to those issued by the Ministry of Finance and mainland policy banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the seventh anniversary of the launch of Bond Connect, Jiang Huifen from the PBOC said the new move will reduce the cost for overseas investors to trade mainland bonds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is going to help further expand the application of renminbi bonds as eligible offshore collateral. It will facilitate overseas institutions to hold renminbi bonds, reducing the costs of overseas institutional investors to join Swap Connect. This initiative will be jointly prepared with Hong Kong and will be launched as soon as possible," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's market regulators and the stock exchange operator welcomed the PBOC's new initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said it plans to implement the new measure by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission said they will guide financial infrastructure institutions to take forward the preparatory work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure will provide Northbound Swap Connect investors with the additional choice of non-cash collateral, reducing their liquidity cost and improving capital efficiency. It will also help vitalise offshore investors' onshore bond holdings and further enhance the attractiveness of onshore bonds," an HKMA spokesperson said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said mainland authorities have chosen two adult giant pandas, aged between five and eight, to be sent to Hong Kong as gifts, hoping the pair will be able to breed in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee said the male panda, which weighs around 120 kilogrammes, is agile and smart, while the 100-kilogramme female panda is gentle and cute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up a three-day visit to Sichuan, the chief executive thanked mainland officials for thoroughly considering the city's requests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had earlier expressed to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration the hope that the two new giant pandas would be able to give birth to the next generation of pandas in Hong Kong, bringing more warmth and joy to Hong Kong. We also hope the giant pandas will be younger adults and physically strong," he told reporters in Chengdu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This pair are now undergoing preparatory work in Dujiangyan, and will be quarantined for 30 days later on. When they arrive in Hong Kong, they will be quarantined for another 30 days. They will then be given time to adapt, before meeting the public."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said Ocean Park will sign a cooperation pact with a mainland giant panda research and breeding facility, and that Hong Kong aims to have the pair arrive by National Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a government statement, the CE highlighted three achievements made during the visit: "the pair of giant pandas to be gifted to Hong Kong have been selected; Ocean Park and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda are working at full steam to draft a co-operation agreement on the details to expedite the approval and implementation of the process; and the establishment of communication channels between Ocean Park, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda to collaborate with and assist one another in facilitating the smooth transfer of the giant pandas to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the culture, sports and tourism minister, said Ocean Park is sending staff members to the province to better understand the giant pandas, while bringing with them bamboo the pair will be consuming in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Ocean Park] will enhance its two facilities for giant pandas, such as adding some plants or climbing frames. We are also considering installing cameras to hopefully share the pandas' activities with the public in real time," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the park will assist with the physical examination of the animals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of performers are gathering in Hong Kong for a six-day event that combines Chinese martial arts and dance to showcase the rich heritage of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Kungfu x Dance Carnival aims to help people develop a deeper appreciation of traditional Chinese culture through a variety of activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video message at the opening ceremony in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive John Lee described the carnival as one of the biggest events in Hong Kong this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the carnival uniquely combines martial arts and dance to showcase the charm of Chinese culture, adding that it serves as a platform to promote cultural exchanges between China and other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Ya, founder of Tangya Arts Tech, which organises the event, said she was delighted to bring together performers from around the world, adding that it was a demonstration of Hong Kong's strength as a centre for cultural and artistic exchange between China and the rest of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are delighted to have attracted 3,000 performers from Hong Kong, the mainland, Macau and more than 10 other countries around the world. They range from four-year-old children to an 82-year-old Tai Chi master from Japan and a 96-year-old Choy Li Fut martial arts master," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Tuesday said authorities must strike a balance between public finances and how much public housing tenants can afford to pay in rent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made the comment after the Housing Authority proposed raising public housing rents by 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved, the increases would take effect in October with a three-month exemption period for most tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some elderly tenants have expressed concerns that they will struggle to afford the increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ho said authorities have to strike a balance between public affordability and financial stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everyone understands that the rent for public housing is much cheaper than in the private market... In public housing, we take care of the living environment, cleanliness, rubbish collection, and maintenance. The rent is low but it helps us maintain financial stability," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister said poor families can apply for rent assistance that cuts their rent by up to 50 percent, adding that the government has been paying the rent for those supported by Comprehensive Social Security Assistance.

    'Regulating ride-hailing services in public interest'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung says the government wants to regulate online ride-hailing services so as to protect people's safety and rights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature on Monday, officials said they plan to give out licences for such services, proposing that the courts could order the seizure of vehicles involved in providing services illegally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said those convicted of providing illegal ride-hailing services could have their driving licence suspended for a period of time, possibly a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, Lam said officials came up with the plans after studying the experiences of other places, such as Shenzhen and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The biggest effect for us regulating online ride-hailing services is that we hope to be able to protect the safety and rights of passengers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without a regulatory framework, the rights and safety might be affected, or insurance issues. I think these are topics that the general public attaches importance to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam’s bureau said transport officials will study public views and how people's needs are changing, with a view to presenting a legislative proposal next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government has been vetting applications for the formation of taxi fleets, as it plans to give out five licences this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam told RTHK that the government is open to the idea of fleet operators cooperating with mainland service providers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issues are scheduled to be discussed at a Legco panel meeting on Friday.

    'Supply and demand to be a factor in ride-hailing'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Gary Zhang says it is noticeable that the government has referred to supply and demand as it moves to regulate online car-hailing platforms, such as Uber.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to lawmakers on Monday, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said it aimed to present the legislative proposal next year but it would first carry out a study on passenger demand and changing needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Zhang said the government had only previously referred to taxi quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact in the policy paper that the government submitted to the Legislative Council yesterday, the government doesn't really take a very clear stance. But they propose further research," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I noticed that in the process of this further research, the government said it would not only just consider the regulation of ride-hailing platforms but also a review of the supply and demand situation of point-to-point transportation services. Traditionally the government seldom mentions such terms as a supply-and-demand issue in any previous public policy document. The discussion generally focused on the service quality of taxis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang said he believed the issue of quality was more likely a result of supply and demand problems. He said it was positive that the government was willing to focus on clarifying this issue in upcoming research, and that this would make further discussions data driven and more scientific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has proposed regulating online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate. But it is also proposing to increase the deterrent effect by withdrawing a driver's licence for a minimum period of time, such as 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau has said it would work with the Department of Justice and police to finalise details.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport and Logistics Bureau on Monday proposed to regulate online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to the Legislative Council, the bureau said it aims to present the legislative proposal next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before making the new rules, the bureau will carry out a study on passenger demand and how their needs are changing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it has already increased penalties for illegal ride-hailing services, but there are limits to enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is proposing to increase the deterrent effect by withdrawing a driver's licence for a minimum period of time, such as 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it would work with the Department of Justice and the police to work out the details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also looked at how other places deal with illegal ride-hailing services, noting that there are already laws regulating online car-hailing platforms in places such as Shenzhen, Singapore, Japan and London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in Shenzhen, for example, people who provide unlicensed ride-hailing services can be fined up to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Uber said it welcomed the government's plan to create a regulatory framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a spokesman for the car-hailing platform said authorities should avoid imposing limits on the number of vehicles that can operate under each platform, warning that this could make ride-hailing services more expensive.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said the government is inclined to charge lower, time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel when it takes over the tunnel in the New Territories in May next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, private car and taxi drivers pay HK$58, while commercial vehicle drivers pay between HK$64 and HK$79.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, officials have outlined three different pricing scenarios, with the third suggesting different tolls for peak, regular and off-peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Private car drivers would pay HK$45, HK$35 and HK$20 respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taxi drivers would pay HK$30 at all times, while commercial vehicles would be charged HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current administration, Lam said officials had spoken to lawmakers about the way forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said most of them supported the idea of charging time-varying tolls, which has been adopted for the three cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since we have all experienced time-varying tolls with the three tunnels and have seen the results, everyone thought about doing the same with the Tai Lam Tunnel," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So right now, the government is inclined to think that a time-varying toll is also a feasible option for Tai Lam."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said a final decision on tolls would be made by the end of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday launched a two-month public consultation on ways to enhance the Copyright Ordinance, to protect artificial intelligence (AI) technology development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and Intellectual Property Department are seeking views on topics including copyright protection for AI-generated works, copyright infringement liability for AI-generated works, and the possible introduction of specific copyright exceptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The rapid advancement of AI technology, particularly generative AI, has induced revolutionary impacts on diverse domains and industries, as well as a number of copyright issues, arousing worldwide concerns,” a bureau spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The copyright regime is an important part of the intellectual property (IP) regime. On one hand, it protects the economic rights of creators in receiving remuneration from their fruits of creativity, and on the other hand, it properly balances the legitimate interests of copyright owners and the public interest," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National 14th Five-Year Plan set out how Hong Kong should be developed into a regional intellectual property trading centre.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A large-scale attraction featuring 36 popular animation characters has been installed on the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade, to promote animation development in Hong Kong and support local athletes at the upcoming Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AniCom Sports Park attraction links iconic local characters from different eras to various sporting events, including Old Master Q playing snooker, Dustykid rowing and Joe from the "City of Darkness" performing wushu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alan Wan, vice president of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation, said he hopes the attraction will further promote and develop animation as an art form in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People may not be familiar with our comic or animation characters, but we hope that people will want to take photos with them even if they don't know them. If they want to learn about the character's origin story, we have put QR codes alongside each installation so people can learn about the character and the artist's background," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to bring joy to people who see our installations. We also hope that through these characters, people can learn more about Hong Kong's animations and comics, which in turn brings more attention to the development of comics and animation in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The installations will be in place for the next two years.

    Public housing tenants face 10% rent increases

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760727_1_20240708164116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public housing tenants face a 10 percent increase in their rent, under a Housing Authority plan presented to Legco on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said the increases will range from HK$49 to HK$572 per month, with the average amount at HK$230.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It slated October 1 as the date for the rises, but proposed a three-month exemption period meaning many tenants wouldn't pay any extra before January 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said "well-off tenants" with income or assets exceeding certain thresholds would not be eligible for the exemption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the proposed rises would be affordable for tenants, with about 60 percent of them seeing a monthly increase of HK$250 or less.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For people who truly need help, we already have mechanisms in place to assist them. As for other tenants, we believe that an increase of HK$250 in monthly rents is affordable for them. This decision takes into account various considerations. We need to respect the mechanisms under our housing regulations," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority estimated that the proposed rent increases would generate additional revenue of around HK$2.3 billion per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the three-month waiver will cost the government HK$575 million in this financial year, the revenue increase would help narrow the authority's expected deficit to HK$591 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang said poorer tenants would find the higher rents unaffordable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A majority of the grassroots class are living in public housing, especially the families who are only elderly or live alone. I mean the elderly just received a welfare (payment). So there's definitely no other choice and there's no opportunity to increase the income. For the grassroots class, especially the elderly family, that is not good news," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent.

    Govt says locals get priority for care home jobs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it anticipates a shortage of care home workers in future. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760723_1_20240708163026.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun on Monday dismissed a claim that the government is "replacing all local care home workers with imported staff".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The allegation came from Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker and executive councillor Stanley Ng, who complained that officials didn't discuss with unions a plan to bring in another 8,000 care home workers in the coming three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past year, 7,000 care workers were brought to Hong Kong under a special scheme for homes that failed to find local staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun told lawmakers that with an ageing population, the demand for care workers will only increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the quota under the import scheme might not be fully used if homes find local staff instead, adding that local workers will always be the main source of manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With reference to actual circumstances, we see or anticipate that there will be a wastage in the sector," Sun said at a Legco welfare services panel meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The age of existing workers is already quite old. If they retire, we cannot meet the service gap because we do not have as many youngsters as we want to join the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials are determined to make sure that local people have priority when it comes to employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a large-scale job fair will be held in September, with many non-governmental organisations operating care homes expected to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that the government will update the Labour Advisory Board about the special import scheme every six months.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University (CUHK) on Monday said it will increase its scholarship funding by almost 90 percent from September, to just under HK$36 million in total.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New students admitted through JUPAS with Level 5** in seven or more subjects will be offered a one-off study allowance and exchange scholarship of HK$410,000, along with a full four-year tuition waiver, the university said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The maximum total value of the scholarship can be over HK$570,000, an increase of over HK$170,000 (approximately 44.6 percent) compared to last year. Adding with scholarships offered by colleges and faculties, the maximum scholarship value will be over HK$1 million."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that students with Level 5** in seven or more subjects who enrol in the six-year medical programme will be offered a full tuition waiver for an additional two years, with the maximum value of the scholarship increasing by around 18 percent to more than HK$660,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of admissions and financial aid Andy Wong said the plan was put in place even before the government recently announced an increase in university tuition fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Economic recovery after the pandemic has not been as ideal as expected. Many families have seen a significant drop in their income, and students are facing pressures of life and study. By significantly enhancing the scholarships, the university hopes that students will be able to focus on their studies without worrying," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university also said the scholarships will switch from annual renewals to one-off allowances, to give students "more flexibility in their arrangements and planning".

    FTU calls on govt to license ride-hailing services

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Monday called on the government to regulate online car-hailing platforms and require their drivers to obtain permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  FTU lawmaker Michael Luk said taxi drivers have struggled to stay afloat in recent years due to competition with illegal cabbies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The taxi industry is facing a severe shortage of drivers, with 10 to 20 percent of taxis idle due to the unlicensed vehicles. Maybe some customers will choose other options," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luk said licensing online ride-hailing services wouldn't hurt the taxi trade and would lead to "fair competition".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't think the ride-hailing services and the traditional taxis are [in conflict]. We think to get rid of the unlicensed vehicles... they can obtain more opportunities to develop the industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the lawmaker said officials can consider subsidising taxi drivers to buy fuel and insurance to minimise the impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, transport officials will brief lawmakers on the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday that he hopes two pandas given to Hong Kong as a present will arrive by National Day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was in Sichuan to discuss the arrangements with mainland officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visiting a panda research centre in Dujiangyan with his wife, the CE saw a number of the animals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of them are super attractive. Male or female, some are strong, some are elegant. It appears they enjoy what they eat. I'm especially happy when I'm here at the centre," Lee told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe when the two giant pandas arrive in Hong Kong, members of the public will be as I am now... they'll feel excited and they'll find the pandas amiable. People will also want to get close to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said officials were still discussing the details regarding sending the pandas to Hong Kong.

    Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760649_1_20240708091647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, said Hong Kong will surpass Switzerland to become the world's largest wealth management hub by 2027.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui said Hong Kong’s appeal in attracting foreign investments has been growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR will continue to improve service quality, noting that the government’s proposals to simplify the process of changing the place of incorporation to Hong Kong will attract overseas companies to establish or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On July 3, the government published new legislative proposals for a regulatory framework that makes it easier for overseas companies to re-domicile in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These proposals include relaxing the requirement for financial statement submission and extending the de-registration period from 60 to 120 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current government term, Hui said Hong Kong's attractiveness to foreign businesses would persist with its low tax rates and relaxed compliance requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In overseas jurisdictions, there have been more requirements for companies to register a place of incorporation. These requirements primarily focus on compliance, such as the need for local economic activities and specific operations. Some companies might enjoy lower compliance requirements or even lower tax rates in these places in the past,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the introduction of a global minimum tax rate and the rising compliance requirements, these incentives are dwindling. So, this has become a driving factor that encourages them to return to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stopped short on predicting the number of companies that would re-domicile to Hong Kong, but stressed a need to establish a suitable platform and framework in advance.

 The Environmental Protection Department says it is investigating a fire on Sunday at a refuse reception centre on Stonecutters Island.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Firefighters had largely put out the blaze by 7 pm, after smoke had been reported in some of the waste about two hours' earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No injuries were reported and all employees were evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre has temporarily suspended its operations and users have been told to use other collection points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it would work with the contractor and the Fire Services Department to investigate the cause of the fire. The department has also told the contractor to submit a report within seven days.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey by the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday highlighted the difficulties faced by tenants living in inadequate accommodation such as subdivided flats, cage homes and rooftop slums during the recent hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Most of the 300 tenants surveyed reported difficulty sleeping and feeling unwell due to the intense heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Observatory, the temperature reached almost 35 degrees Celsius on Sunday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey showed that the indoor temperature in these cramped flats could reach as high as 41 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze Lai-shan, the organisation's deputy director, said the heat had also increased the utility bills of these tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called on the government to subsidise water and electricity bills for these tenants, and to build more public and transitional housing so that they have decent accommodation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday that he would work with the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office to arrange the early arrival of two giant pandas in the SAR during his trip to Sichuan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee announced on July 1 that the central government would send the pandas to the territory as gifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters before his departure, the CE said he would visit the giant pandas as well as local facilities in the province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would also like to thank the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office for sending leading officials to Sichuan and working with us to arrange the early arrival of the giant pandas in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee and his delegation will visit the Dujiangyan base of the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, said she hoped the pandas could arrive before the National Day celebrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If conditions allow, we can try to bring more than two pandas to Hong Kong for a short stay to see if they can adapt. Of course, in the end, we may have to choose the two pandas who have the most fun in Hong Kong to stay here," she said.

    English Schools Foundation proud of IB exam results

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Among the top local scorers are 17 students from the seven schools run by the English Schools Foundation. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760576_1_20240707141728.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Students who have achieved a perfect score in the International Baccalaureate (IB) exams have expressed their desire to make a positive impact in their chosen fields and contribute to society.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They come from seven schools run by the English Schools Foundation, which was proud to see 17 of its students achieve a perfect score of 45, more than double the number who did so last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them is Tsang Chi-him from King George V School. He expressed his desire to become a doctor to help alleviate the shortage of medical staff in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do realise that Hong Kong currently has a shortage of doctors, and I do wish to help alleviate this problem. I would like to give back to my community as well, and help with the situation here in Hong Kong as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another student from the same school shared her aspirations to study bioengineering at the University of California in Los Angeles and return to Hong Kong after graduation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just in the LA area, especially there is a lot of startups and a lot of advancements regarding the bioengineering industry, and there's just a lot more working opportunities there," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I do hope to come back to Hong Kong, because I do know that the bioengineering industry in Hong Kong is growing really rapidly right now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Christopher Dingcong, a top scorer from Sha Tin College, plans to study aerospace engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to pursue a degree outside of Hong Kong, because for me, specifically I'm doing aerospace engineering, and abroad, there are many universities with much more experience in that," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Here in Hong Kong, it's still okay. Of course we have it, but just the land and the landscape doesn't really lend itself to having those facilities that they would often need for aerospace engineering like runways or stuff like that for aircraft."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Baccalaureate Organisation has previously confirmed that some candidates appeared to have leaked exam questions on social media before other students in later time zones sat the same papers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rob Shorthouse, ESF's director of strategy and communications, said the incident had not affected the performance of ESF students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the results that our students have achieved, while it was an unwelcome distraction, it hasn't had an impact. Our students have done very, very well and we're proud of every single one of them," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 2,400 Hong Kong students sat the IB exams this year, with at least 29 of them achieving the highest possible score. The average score was 36.63, higher than the global average of 30.32.

 Police arrested two teenagers on Sunday on suspicion of stealing a minibus in Mong Kok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a minibus driver reported at around 7am that his vehicle, parked on Sai Yeung Choi Street South, had gone missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police later found the minibus near the Sheung Shui MTR station and arrested the two suspects, aged 19 and 13, nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were detained on suspicion of taking conveyance without authority, driving without a licence and without third-party insurance.

    'Cognitively impaired elderly could benefit from tech'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Councillor Lam Ching-choi said on Sunday that officials are exploring the use of advanced technology, such as facial recognition, in housing estates to prevent elderly people with cognitive impairment from getting lost.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam, who heads an advisory committee on mental health, mentioned that tracking devices are currently being used on some elderly people with cognitive impairment. These technologies can enable them to get out and about without getting lost, which is good for their mental wellbeing and that of their carers, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The use of facial recognition and artificial intelligence is one of the methods. This will certainly require the consent of the elderly and their family members," Lam said after attending a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of such products that have been tested, and the success rate is high. So by using different types of technology, results can be achieved."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another matter, Lam expressed concern about the shortage of staff in residential care homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He revealed that there is currently a shortage of 20 to 30 percent of the required staff, even after the arrival of 7,000 imported workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To address this, the government plans to import about 8,000 workers in phases over the next three years, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested exploring cooperation with training organisations on the mainland so that caregivers can obtain the necessary licences before coming to work in Hong Kong.

    Visually-impaired passengers get HK Express apology

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Express Airways on Sunday apologised to two passengers, who are visually impaired, after staff asked them to leave a flight to Tokyo in May.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move came after the Hong Kong Blind Union said two of its members had complained that they had been unreasonably forced to leave the plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference, the union said the airline had cited safety reasons for asking them to leave. The Blind Union's president, Billy Wong, said a new approach was needed from the Civil Aviation Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a supervisory and coordinating agency and a government department, we hope the Civil Aviation Department can do more to help people with visual impairments or disabilities so they can use these services easily and equally in Hong Kong, which is an aviation hub," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the budget carrier said it was sorry for the inconvenience and delay caused to the passengers and promised to provide compensation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its ground staff and crew members had different assessments of the two passengers who had initially been unable to board their original flight as scheduled following, what it described as, a thorough assessment by management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the airline said it was later confirmed that both passengers could safely travel unaccompanied and staff immediately arranged for them to board another flight on the same day.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business remained resilient despite geopolitical headwinds last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said assets under management stood at more than HK$31 trillion in 2023, up about 2.1 per cent year-on-year, with two-thirds of the assets coming from outside the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that the SAR remained the second largest private equity management centre after the mainland, with private equity fund assets exceeding HK$1.7 trillion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The above figures show that despite the changing international geopolitical situation, investors still have confidence in the prospects of the mainland and Hong Kong markets," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is important for us to do our job well and continue to explain how the country is steadily improving, the central government's strong support for Hong Kong and the unique benefits under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the city's flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, had announced that it would buy back the remaining preference shares from the government this month, showing that the aviation industry was moving towards full normalcy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Saturday said they have uncovered the first ever underground cigarette factory in Lau Fau Shan. They said the facility was equipped with a complete production line.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authorities also uncovered a cigarette storage warehouse in Man Kam To and seized over 20 million suspected illicit cigarettes and about 3.5 tonnes of processed tobacco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the haul had a market value of HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four men, aged 29 to 46 were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs division commander Lam Chak-lun said the investment in this cigarette production line had been huge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “First, it was located in a large-scale, airtight prefabricated building. And the building was heavily insulated with industrial soundproofing material, hidden inside a factory,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It can effectively block light and noise generated while the machines are running. It was also powered by solar panels, likely to avoid drawing attention from authorities due to high electricity usage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities said they believed the production line was on a test run and had only been operational for a short time.

 Two women accused of kidnapping a three-year-old boy in Tseung Kwan O were remanded in custody after appearing in court on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair, Xue Shanshan and Leung Lai-wa, both unemployed, faced a charge of kidnapping for allegedly forcibly taking the boy against his will from a mall on Wednesday with the intent of obtaining ransom in exchange for the child's release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boy, allegedly taken for a ransom in cryptocurrency, was rescued by officers in a flat in Tseung Kwan O on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern Court Magistrate Don So rejected a bail application from one of the women, and the other did not apply for bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case has been adjourned until September 23.

    'New social workers board chair qualified for the job'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare secretary Chris Sun on Saturday expressed confidence that a lawyer appointed to chair a statutory body overseeing social workers will command the respect of the sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Herman Hui was among 12 new members picked by the government to the reformed Social Workers Registration Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after a radio programme, the minister acknowledged that the board's chairperson was not a registered social worker, but noted his status within the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Herman [Hui] is well-known in the welfare field. He has been serving the sector for more than 30 years. While he's not a registered social worker, I'm sure for those in the welfare sector, Herman is so well-known because of his dedication, commitment, and also selfless service to the sector. I'm sure he's going to command the respect of the sector," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said it did not matter where the board members came from, following suggestions that the government could bring in representatives from smaller organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said members were appointed to the statutory body on a personal basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They are requested to carry out their duties dutifully, and not having regard to where they are coming from. There's no difference for those coming from larger, smaller, or medium-sized welfare organisations, because they look after social workers from an independent point of view," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Social Workers Registration Board was only concerned with the registration of individual social workers, and not welfare institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not relevant whether or not they are coming from larger or smaller organisations in the field," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grace Chan, the business director of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, is the deputy chairperson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other members include former permanent secretary for labour and welfare Annie Tam, as well as members of the government's social welfare advisory committee, Frederick Lai and Barry Wong, who are all part of a coalition, the Hong Kong Social Welfare Sector Heart to Heart Joint Action.

    HK 'hoping for locally-bred panda': Kevin Yeung

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tourism chief Kevin Yeung says the SAR delegation to Sichuan will discuss matters such as transport and quarantine arrangements for the two giant pandas. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760485_1_20240706102646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong officials plan to tell Beijing of the SAR's desire for a locally bred giant panda during a visit to fine-tune the arrangements for two animals that the central government is giving to the city, according to the tourism chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, also said on Saturday that he hoped the two giant pandas will arrive in the city in two to three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister, along with Chief Executive John Lee, his wife, and other officials, are set to head to Sichuan on Sunday to know more about the arrival of the two giant pandas and discuss transport and quarantine arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Yeung said local officials are expressing their wish to see the birth of the city's first panda cub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that most people in the SAR would like to see pandas being born in Hong Kong. We've expressed this wish," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, the central government is gifting us a pair of giant pandas. I believe they'll take our wish into consideration. But in the end, it's up to the central government and mainland departments to decide."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the two animals could come to Hong Kong in around two to three months, but it would ultimately depend on their conditions after quarantining for a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's tourist figures, Yeung said he is confident that this year could see 46 million arrivals, with more people expected to visit Hong Kong during the summer and public holidays in the latter half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he conceded that spending patterns have changed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The retail sector, as a whole, cannot simply rely on spending from tourists to boost sales... Other than thinking of ways to attract tourists to spend more here, we also need to look for ways to have people in Hong Kong spend more," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said authorities will conduct test runs at the Kai Tak Sports Park in early 2025 by hosting a sporting event and a performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that the administration hoped to have around 50,000 people test out the venue and transport arrangements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Sichuan on Sunday for a three-day visit to know more about arrangements for the arrival of two giant pandas from the province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was announced on Monday that the central government will send the pandas to Hong Kong as gifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a government statement, Lee and his delegation will visit the Dujiangyan Base of the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. He will also meet with leaders of Sichuan Province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's wife; Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung; director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department Mickey Lai; and representatives from Ocean Park will be joining the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE thanked the mainland authorities for their support, adding that the SAR government will make adequate preparations in receiving the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thank the Sichuan Provincial Government for attaching importance to the overall arrangements of gifting giant pandas to the HKSAR," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will meticulously deliberate on and understand the preparatory work for receiving the two new members of the Hong Kong family. The HKSAR Government will endeavour to make good arrangements for welcoming the giant pandas."

    'Govt mulls cutting Tai Lam Tunnel tolls'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government may introduce time-varying tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760439_1_20240705205800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the government is considering various proposals that would reduce tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel after taking control of it in May next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, tolls for private cars and taxis stand at HK$58.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities have met representatives from various political parties to discuss the proposed changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One idea being floated is to charge private cars from HK$20 to HK$45, based on the time of the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also proposals to lower the tolls for private cars and taxis to HK$35 or HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another option under consideration is to keep the current tolls unchanged, but officials fear that may lead to congestion at nearby Tuen Mun Road, Tolo Highway and Ting Kau Bridge during the rush hour by 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who is a member of Legco transport panel, called on the government to introduce time-varying tolls at the tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At one hand, we need to ensure that even during peak hours, Tai Lam Tunnel can continue to be a convenient and not very congested route for different users, especially for our commercial vehicles, because that's a very important corridor for Hong Kong logistics industry," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, the residents, they do have very high expectation of a toll reduction of the Tai Lam Tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien urged the government to lower tolls to less than HK$35.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've always used the VC ratio, which is the volume capacity ratio of 1.2 as a basis of calculation. If we use VC ratio of 1, which means the capacity is equal to the volume, every single bridge and tunnel in Hong Kong will be considered overcapacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the couple of scenarios that they use all resulted in the Ting Kau Bridge having a volume capacity ratio less than 1.2. If that's the case, we still have room for the downward adjustment."

    Calls for more support for women to rejoin workplace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB says many women encounter difficulties when trying to find jobs after a break. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760429_1_20240705195809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday called for greater support for women to re-enter the workforce as part of efforts to tackle a manpower shortage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party said only 56 percent of women in Hong Kong are working, a figure that is lower than other regions of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said women who chose to leave their jobs to give birth or take care of their family members face difficulties when trying to return to the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is hard for women to go back to work after leaving for a while. They face difficulties such as low education background and no relevant experience, and there is not enough support for them. Is it a must for women to pick between family and work rather than having it all?” Quat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Associate professor Dai Haijing from the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Social Work Department said women still face workplace discrimination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe the gender effect is still there because the majority of caregivers in the world, they are women. Fathers are doing pretty well in Hong Kong compared with other places in the world... [while] filial daughters taking care of their ageing parents are being penalised in the labour market,” Dai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong turns out to be very conservative in terms of gender ideology; there should be some advocacy for gender equality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another DAB lawmaker, Frankie Ngan, urged the government to take the lead in expanding childcare services, such as setting up childcare centres in government facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also suggested that the Employees Retraining Board provide more flexible courses to mothers, among other ideas.
