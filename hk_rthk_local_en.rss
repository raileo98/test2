    <![CDATA[<img alt="HKU researchers say this palm-sized cube holds the key to identifying the right treatment for cancer patients.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong University's faculty of medicine on Tuesday said it had developed a new technique which would make it faster to identify the precise treatment for liver cancer patients.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using three-dimensional bio-printing, researchers produced cube-shaped models which mimicked tumours or cancerous cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different drugs would then be administered to see which was most effective, saving the need for patients to go through clinical trials, as well as precious time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will be very important in developing new treatments, or screen new drugs for the cancer patients, especially in new therapy," said Professor Man Kwan, who led the study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To produce a "liver-in-cube", researchers must first collect tissue samples from the patient. The samples are then processed into "bio-ink", the essential ingredient for bio-printing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to half a dozen cubes can be produced to speed up drug screening, as well as learn about the tumour's reaction to different treatments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Man believed the technique could be applied to other types of cancer too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This technology can be applied on different cancers - not only for liver cancer, [but also] lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer as well," the surgeon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technique is undergoing pre-clinical studies to affirm its safety and efficacy. Man would not disclose the cost for patients, citing confidentiality agreements with potential partners.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the Bar Association and the Law Society on Tuesday expressed confidence towards Hong Kong's judicial independence, following an opinion piece by a former non-permanent judge of the city's top court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lord Jonathan Sumption, who has resigned as a judge of the Court of Final Appeal, penned an article in the Financial Times which mentioned Hong Kong's rule of law and a recent ruling in a landmark subversion trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bar Association said the city has faced numerous challenges over the past few years and the judiciary's role has "never been more important".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [association] has every confidence in the independence of our judiciary and we urge the public to support the work of our judges and every effort to safeguard judicial independence and to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is also important to appreciate that our judges can only decide cases on the basis of the legal arguments advanced and the evidence before them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association added that it would not comment on specific cases, particularly those which are currently under judicial consideration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the retirement of Madam Justice Beverley McLachlin from the top court, the legal body expressed its gratitude towards the former Canadian top judge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are grateful for her contributions to the rule of law and administration of justice in Hong Kong since she was first appointed to the [Court of Final Appeal] in 2018. We echo the sentiment in her statement regarding her confidence in the members of the court, their independence and their determination to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Law Society also expressed confidence in the judiciary, with its new president, Roden Tong, highlighting its independence and the city's robust legal system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about Lord Sumption's opinion piece, Tong said legal professionals should refrain from making political comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as a legal professional, one should always remember that our duty to discharging our duties has to be apolitical – commenting simply from a legal perspective and not from any political lens," he said.

    'Cathay cadet training to resume if conditions met'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Tuesday said solo flight training for its cadets would resume once they follow the flying school's requirements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  AeroGuard Flight Training Centre, a pilot training school in the United States, reportedly suspended all solo flights for Cathay cadets, after some failed to report incidents while out flying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline's general manager flying Tim Burns said training for cadets would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's many different areas which need to be trained. Solo flying is just one small proportion. So the students will continue on the rest of their training," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some will have some of their solo flying delayed, while AeroGuard ensures that the cadets are aware of how to report any incidents and that everyone does follow the requirements of the flying school, and once that's satisfied, then they will resume the solo flying."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Cathay said the last of its aircraft, that was stored during the pandemic, is back in Hong Kong - marking a milestone for the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR’s flag carrier said 85 of its passenger aircraft were parked outside of Hong Kong due to the impact of the pandemic. One of these locations was Alice Springs in Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex McGowan, the airline's chief operations and service delivery officer, said bringing the fleet back was a remarkable achievement for the company, with Cathay expecting its passenger flights to return to pre-pandemic level by the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to rebuild, everything in the ecosystem needs to be working in harmony, so our aircraft coming back into service is one aspect. Ensuring that our pilots and our cabin crew are recruited and trained to the right standards after a long period of not flying or not flying regularly is important as well," he said.

    Exco approves 3 percent pay rise for civil servants

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil servants are set to receive an across-the-board pay rise of three percent, backdated to the beginning of April this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive in Council on Tuesday approved the move, with the proposal to be tabled to Legco as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Executive Council said it thoroughly considered the response to the pay rise from government staff, and balanced a number of factors under the adjustment mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include the state of Hong Kong's economy, the government's fiscal position, inflation, pay trend indicators and civil service morale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Civil Service Bureau said the authorities had to be prudent with the adjustment, given the government's current deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the meantime, the vacancy level in the civil service has climbed to 10 percent under a tight labour market. Civil servants of all ranks have shouldered additional responsibilities," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy has recorded actual growth with inflation over the past year. There were also pay rises in private organisations."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Andrew Cheung says striking the right balance between protection of fundamental rights and safeguarding national security can be difficult and outcomes are controversial at times. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756943_1_20240611145227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said on Tuesday that the judiciary is firmly committed to protecting people's fundamental rights and safeguarding national security, adding that he is confident the courts handle appeals with integrity and professionalism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung's statement came in response to an opinion piece by Lord Jonathan Sumption, who resigned as a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Sumption had said in an article published in the Financial Times that the rule of law in Hong Kong was "profoundly compromised in any area about which the government feels strongly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Cheung said that finding the right balance between protecting people's rights and ensuring national security can be challenging and controversial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As in other jurisdictions, a tension often exists between protection of fundamental rights and safeguarding national security, both of which the Hong Kong Judiciary is firmly committed to doing," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Striking the right balance in individual cases can be difficult and outcomes controversial at times. It is one thing to disagree with a court's decision, but it is quite another to suggest that fundamental rights have been compromised because of political concerns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said that while everyone has the right to express their views, public opinions potentially put pressure on or interfere with the courts' administration of justice, and should therefore be expressed with caution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that all judges are obliged to make impartial and independent decisions based on the law and evidence, as stated in their judicial oath.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any suggestion that their decisions have been or may be influenced by extraneous considerations, political or otherwise, is a serious allegation that must be duly substantiated and should not be lightly made," he said.

    Privacy watchdog issues AI adoption guidelines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung says workers should retain control when high-risk AI applications are used to help make decisions. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756939_1_20240611143448.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data on Tuesday issued a set of guidelines for organisations to protect data when using artificial intelligence systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog said local institutions are becoming aware of the privacy risks that AI poses, as more and more of them start making use of such technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost half of all organisations in Hong Kong are expected to use AI this year – up from 30 percent in 2023, according to the Productivity Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said a lot of information needs to be collected to train or operate AI systems and people's privacy will be infringed if these details are leaked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the new Model Personal Data Protection Framework details steps organisations should take when procuring and using any AI system that makes use of personal details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, institutions are advised to minimise the collection of personal data, conduct rigorous testing of their system, ensure data security and devise an incident response plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said organisations should also let workers retain control when high-risk AI applications are used to help make decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the use of the AI system involves the collection of biometric data, of course that would be a high-risk scenario. And if the AI system is to provide recommendations on the granting of credit to individuals or institutions, that would also be a high-risk scenario," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, if the AI system is only used to provide basic information relating to the services or products of the organisation, such as information provided by an AI chatbot, the risk would be lower."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung added that organisations should also offer their customers adequate information on their AI systems and allow them to access, correct or delete their data.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers are set to travel and visit exhibitions at no cost while enjoying a raft of discounts on July 1, as part of celebrations to mark the 27th anniversary of the city's return to the motherland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Revealing the celebration plans at a press briefing ahead of this week's Executive Council meeting, Chief Executive John Lee said all tram and light rail journeys will be free, as well as some bus services in the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of MTR routes will be free for children aged between three and 11, while residents will be welcome to use various indoor and outdoor facilities run by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who are interested in arts and history can get free access to the regular and standard exhibitions at the Hong Kong Science Museum, Hong Kong Space Museum and M+ Museum, as well as special exhibitions at the Hong Kong Museum of Art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, all exhibitions at the Hong Kong Palace Museum will be free, and there will be no charge to get into the Hong Kong Wetland Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to Ocean Park will get 30 percent off their tickets between June 29 and July 1, and children as well as the elderly will get discounted tickets when they take the Peak Tram on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over a thousand restaurants will roll out discounts on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that more details will be revealed by various government departments and organisations at a later date.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dragonboat teams throughout Hong Kong had spent months preparing for Monday's Tuen Ng Festival races. One of those teams was Hong Kong's only dragonboat crew made up primarily of the visually impaired – the Darkness Fighters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their mantra is to "challenge the impossible", and their goal: to create a blind-friendly sports environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our reporter Anne Chan attended the Fighters' training sessions to see how members of the team were able to conquer their limitations by rowing together.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the successful selection of a Hong Kong astronaut in the national space programme marked a “glorious chapter” in the city’s history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came after state broadcaster CCTV, quoting the China Manned Space Agency, reported that the 10 people were selected as the fourth batch of national preparatory astronauts, among whom eight were space pilots, and two were payload specialists from Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he felt very excited and encouraged by the selection of a Hong Kong candidate, as he thanked the central government for providing the opportunity for Hongkongers to participate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's only under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle that the SAR is eligible for selection in the national space programme, as the programme is a national task.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Secondly, [the selection] indicates that the nation attaches great importance to the SAR's technological and innovation development. The SAR government will continue to promote measures to nurture more innovation and technology talent and support the city in becoming an international tech and innovation hub,” Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Lee, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, also expressed his congratulations, as he pledged the SAR government would do everything possible to assist the candidate successfully complete their training on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I know the public is looking forward to knowing about who is selected, but as we know there are many considerations from the nation when selecting preparatory astronauts, and in its usual practice, the nation will only publish the number of the candidates for the time being, and will not reveal the identities of the candidates.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR government will continue to maintain communications with mainland authorities, and publish details in due course,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology chief also noted the candidate was among 120 people who were originally signed up for the recruitment drive in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition to the basic physical and educational requirements, there’s also quite diverse professional requirements in areas including natural science, engineering, biomedics,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While both Lee and Sun did not disclose the Hong Kong astronaut’s identity and other details, sources told RTHK the person selected was Lai Ka-ying, a chief inspector with the Hong Kong Police Force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has a doctoral degree and has three children. She will travel to the mainland for subsequent training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The recruitment of astronauts from Hong Kong and Macau was launched in October 2022, marking the first time the nation’s space programme considered selecting astronauts from the two SARs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three selection rounds have been held since the recruitment drive was launched, and Lee noted the recruitment process was very strict.

    Judges should focus on legal matters, not politics: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday a judge's professional duty is to interpret and apply the law, and that his or her expertise is not on politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee also said a departing non-permanent judge, Lord Jonathan Sumption, had contradicted his earlier comments with an opinion piece in the Financial Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Sumption, who recently resigned as a judge on the Court of Final Appeal, wrote an article in the British newspaper titled "The rule of law in Hong Kong is in grave danger".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the overseas judge had expressed different views a few years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 2021, Lord Sumption refused to take part in a political boycott orchestrated in the UK. And he said then that people should not confuse the rule of law with democracy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His latest statement indicates that he doesn't like the political situation in Hong Kong. But this is exactly the area he has told us in 2021 that should not be confused with the rule of law. His recent statement looks to me to be contradictory to his previous stance in this regard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said judges should focus on handling legal matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Judges' professional expertise is on law, based on his legal knowledge and experience. Judges' professional expertise is not on politics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A judge is entitled to his personal political preferences, but that is not a judge's area of professional expertise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A judge can like a particular system or dislike it. He may also like a particular law or not. But his professional duty is to interpret and apply that particular piece of law in accordance with legal principles and evidence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also hit out at overseas efforts to attack the rule of law, saying that non-interference in the judicial process is "the DNA of Hong Kong's rule of law".

    HKU heads must put interests of university first: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he stressed the importance of communication and cooperation when he met University of Hong Kong officials involved in a spat over senior appointments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang recently complained that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Priscilla Wong, chairwoman of the university's governing council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said he has met both Zhang and Wong and reminded them to put the interests of the university first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[HKU] doesn't belong to the vice-chancellor. It doesn't belong to any individual of the council. HKU belongs to all Hong Kong people," the CE said before attending this week's Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all matters, we must take the interest of HKU as the overriding principle. Universities need to seek continuous improvement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said there are certain requirements universities have to conform to when they are given billions of dollars in public money, including on governance, administration and finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Procedures need to be clarified if they are unclear, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday afternoon, the government announced the formation of a taskforce to investigate the controversy at the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the [Education Bureau] has gathered from relevant parties, there is inconsistency in the information provided by different parties and a need to clarify the facts and study how to deal with the matter," a government spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The taskforce will carry out fact-finding, coordinate internal communication and cooperation within HKU, and make recommendations on improvement measures to ensure that public money is well spent and that the university operates within regulations on public grants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li, and Tim Lui who chairs the University Grants Committee, will be on the taskforce and officials say they will start their work as soon as possible.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A government statement has expressed "strong disagreements" over remarks made by a departing non-permanent judge of the top appeals court, Lord Jonathan Sumption, who wrote an opinion piece entitled "The rule of law in Hong Kong is in grave danger".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overseas judge wrote in the Financial Times that his local counterparts were caught "in an impossible political environment created by China", and that the rule of law was "profoundly compromised in any area about which the government feels strongly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also mentioned a recent ruling on a landmark subversion trial, saying it was "symptomatic of a growing malaise in the Hong Kong judiciary".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said there was "absolutely no truth" that Hong Kong's courts were "under any political pressure from the central authorities in the adjudication of national security cases, or that there is any decline in the rule of law in the SAR".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson said anyone who suggested otherwise would be "utterly wrong, totally baseless, and must be righteously refuted", regardless of their reasoning or motives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement went on to quote Chief Executive John Lee, who said the Hong Kong government "has never, and also will not allow anyone to interfere with the prosecutions of the Department of Justice and trials by the court".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is how it was in the past, how it is at present, and how it will be in future. The rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and will not change," Lee said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary has confirmed that non-permanent judge Beverley McLachlin, who sits on the city’s top court, will not stay on when her term expires at the end of July this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Madam McLachlin, who once served as the Chief Justice of Canada, has been a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July 2021, the former Canadian top judge had her term extended for three more years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian media cited Madam McLachlin as saying that she had turned 80 years old and would end her term as scheduled in late July, adding that she had confidence in the court's judicial independence and determination to maintain the rule of law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government thanked the judge for her contribution to Hong Kong's judicial system, as well as her objective appraisal of the rule of law in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in a statement that Madam McLachlin had reiterated "her confidence in the members of the court, their independence, and their determination to uphold the rule of law".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police investigating the death of a man, who was dumped outside of North District Hospital with serious injuries early on Saturday, said they had made an arrest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Detectives said the 32-year-old suspect was picked up in Tin Shui Wai and was believed to be linked to the car used to drop off the victim in Sheung Shui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting senior superintendent Basil Tang, from the New Territories North Crime Regional Headquarters, said officers received a report from a passer-by at around 5.45am on Saturday that the 23-year-old man was lying unconscious near a pedestrian crossing on Po Kin Road, where the hospital is located.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the victim was then brought inside the hospital where he was pronounced dead an hour later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang also said that the deceased had multiple injuries that are thought to have been caused by blunt objects, punches and kicks, adding that his cause of death was still under investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were called to a suspicious vehicle in Wong Chuk Yuen in Pat Heung on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police arrived at the scene to conduct an investigation and believed that this vehicle was involved in the incident. At the time of the incident, someone put on a fake license plate and abandoned the deceased outside of the mentioned hospital," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police and laboratory personnel later searched the car and found blood stains and a stun gun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were treating the case as murder, saying they believe others were involved and remained at large.

    'Catering revenue down by 30pc over Tuen Ng Festival'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Simon Wong, head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, says the local catering sector saw revenues down by 30 percent year on year during the Tuen Ng Festival period. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756819_1_20240610171210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Monday said the holiday weekend had brought little cheer to the industry, with revenues down by about 30 percent compared with last year's Tuen Ng Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The slump came despite Immigration Department figures suggesting that fewer Hongkongers travelled to the mainland than those who headed out over Easter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to official figures, some 840,000 Hongkongers headed north over Saturday and Sunday, 10 percent less compared with the number seen in the first two days of the Easter holiday period when over one million residents travelled to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[But]I don't see any positive signs on our revenues,” said Simon Wong, the head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, in an interview with RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His remarks came as official data also showed that more mainland visitors, or some 250,000 people, visited the SAR over Saturday and Sunday, over 40 percent more compared with the 170,000 recorded during the first two days of the Easter holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We do have some activities going on in these couple of days, [especially] some activities in the Tsim Sha Tsui area that would attract more people, including tourists from the mainland and also local residents,” Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But in other districts in Hong Kong, it became quieter - in a way that too many people went over to the harbour area,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the catering veteran noted that sales of “zongzi”, the traditional holiday sticky rice dumplings, were not ideal either, down by about 20 percent compared with previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People are more concerned about [their] health now. In the past, a lot of retail outlets produced their own ‘zongzi’, but in the festival this year, some restaurants did not offer this kind of product. Most of the new [zongzi] products [did not generate] good sales either,” Wong explained, adding that some residents also bought "zongzi" on the mainland instead of Hong Kong due to the cheaper prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to the increasing challenges faced by local restaurants, as more mainland brands expand into the SAR to test the market before going abroad, Wong said that the local catering industry could learn from their mainland peers, including using technology, to ease their difficulties including manpower issues.

 Firefighters on Monday said they found about 40 suspected cat corpses, after extinguishing a fire in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the fire broke out in a tin-sheet house on Kam Shui South Road in Pat Heung at around 11am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firefighters said no one was injured and suspect that an electrical short circuit caused the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they believe stray cats and dogs were being looked after in the premises, and they have notified the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to follow up the case.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sound of cheering crowds and the rhythmic pounding of drums filled the air at venues across Hong Kong on Monday, as dragon boat races took place to celebrate Tuen Ng Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of paddlers enjoyed the fruits of months of back-breaking training as they took to the waters of Stanley, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Sai Kung, Tuen Mun, Aberdeen, and Tai O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sha Tin, the Marine Dragon Boat Team celebrated victory in one of 28 races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere here is very, very exciting. The weather is good too! We’ve dedicated two months to practice. Regardless of whether it's day or night, we all strive together in our practices," said one team paddler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels refreshing to see everyone putting in such effort and working together towards the same goal. It feels great. The atmosphere is exceptional. Everyone is happy, cheering for them together. I will come back to see it again next year," said Sabrina Wang, a tourist watching the races for the very first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, some 190 teams competed off Stanley Main Beach in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris from City University said his team had practised for 10 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We heard that rain had poured every year here, but the weather is fine today. Synchronisation is the most important factor. Individual strength matters less. The overall strength of a team is the essence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said the HKEX team was full of confidence going into their competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We practised even when the Typhoon Signal No. 3 was issued, during an Amber Rainstorm Warning, and even a Red Rainstorm Warning. Today, we were finally able to get into the water. We are thrilled," she said.

    Govt urged to speed up dental care plan in GBA

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Li Kwai-yin, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants’ Association, says she welcomes the government's plan to contract out dental treatment for civil servants to the mainland. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756791_1_20240610124418.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of a civil service union on Monday welcomed the administration's plan to facilitate dental services in Greater Bay Area cities so government workers can get faster treatment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, floated the idea last week, noting a lack of dentists in public clinics in the SAR, while acknowledging authorities need to offer more benefits to retain staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Li Kwai-yin, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants’ Association, said she welcomed the government’s plan, but noted officials should move fast to ramp up dental services as the dentist manpower crunch was rather “severe”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, regarding the dental cleaning service, in the past we had it about once every 12 to 18 months, but now it takes 40 months to receive the next appointment notice to do dental cleaning, and the waiting time for dental treatment services is even longer - it's taking years to receive treatments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For some newly joined civil servants, they didn't even get a chance to do a dental check after waiting for three to four years,” she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also noted that Grade 3A general hospitals in Shenzhen, or the University of Hong Kong–Shenzhen Hospital, could be prioritised to save on travelling time under the plan, and that the scope of the treatments could not only cover dental cleaning, but also other simple treatments, such as tooth filling and tooth extraction procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Private institutions with quality services could be considered as well, Li added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also hopes authorities could further study the feasibility of sharing medical and health records between hospitals in the SAR and the mainland to ease the city's tight dental care services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government last July rolled out a pilot scheme on dental scaling for eligible civil servants to reduce the burden on public healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV programme on Sunday, civil service minister Yeung said there were some technical difficulties with tracking health records and determining the scope of treatments that could be done outside Hong Kong, but noted that authorities need to provide more benefits to maintain the competitiveness of civil service jobs in the face of a broader manpower shortage issue.

    'Ban flavoured shisha to reduce smokers in HK'
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tobacco control advocate on Monday said the government should ban flavoured shisha, as part of an overhaul of smoking controls.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry Tong, chairman of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health, made the comment after the administration announced 10 measures last week to quickly reduce smoking, including a ban on flavoured cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, he noted that shisha, or tobacco smoked through a waterpipe, remains legal, but said it should face similar regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Shisha is very attractive to young people and women, mainly because there are many flavours and fruity flavours. The law should be clear when it comes to banning flavoured cigarettes. There shouldn't be flavouring agents allowed in shisha," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The implementation of new policies is a step-by-step process, and it is necessary to understand the public's acceptance level. Banning sales and purchases is the first step. I think we can continue to study how to prohibit possession and hopefully that can be implemented soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong also said that banning smoking in queues was a good start given that regulations were easy to define, but a measure to stop "smoking while walking" should be implemented as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Tsui Yuen, a member of the Long-Term Tobacco Policy Concern Group, said he agreed with the extension of smoke-free areas, but suggested the addition of smoking areas as a means of compromise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Non-smoking areas can suppress the problem of second-hand smoking and reduce conflicts between smokers and non-smokers. In addition to adding non-smoking areas, we can also follow Japan and Europe and add some smoking areas or smoking rooms for public use. This can reduce the problem of second-hand smoking, limit littering and help the environment," he said.

    Govt urged to limit how much helpers can borrow

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government was on Sunday urged to limit how much domestic helpers are allowed to borrow and to introduce licensing for debt collectors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung made the call after being approached for help by around 20 employers, who told him that their helpers had fallen victim to loan traps after filling out online forms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said helpers had to pay back amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently in Hong Kong, [lenders] need to get a licence. However for debt collectors, they do not need to apply for a licence. However, in many places around the world for example in the UK, debt collectors do need a licence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this kind of situation worsens in Hong Kong, I believe that it will force the government to take further steps to set up certain laws to contain this kind of illegal debt collecting. For example, for debt collectors, they need to apply for a certain licence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said one disturbing trend involved debt collectors threatening to publish AI-generated pornographic deepfake photos of employers who refused to pay their helpers' debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted a case of a helper borrowing money from a lender outside Hong Kong and being hit with a demand for more than double the sum just two weeks later.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has said that top officials of a Christian college set up to help students quit drugs have only themselves to blame for its imminent closure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng College announced on Friday that the school on Lantau Island would close on July 7. It comes after four members of staff were arrested in a conspiracy to defraud case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three former board members of the association are on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's new directors said police had frozen HK$4 million in the college's bank accounts, and the government owed HK$3.5 million in project fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to an RTHK enquiry, the government denied owing the cash-strapped college money and said it had provided emergency funding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, as long as the two fugitive former directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng Association, Jacob Lam and Alman Chan, cooperate and complete the procedures to change bank account signatures, the problem can be solved," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that officials are offering assistance to students affected by Zheng Sheng's closure, including helping to transfer five of them who are currently living in a drug rehabilitation under the college.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, the college's supervisor Choi Hong-sheung criticised the new directors for being influenced by the two former directors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi and three other board members resigned on Friday.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said a government-owned investment vehicle will sign a cooperation deal on Wednesday with a local "tech unicorn" – a start-up company worth more than US$1 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan did not name the company concerned, but said it operated in the artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the tie-up with Hong Kong Investment Corporation will help the business expand research and development investment here, as well as fund training of staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said the deal would help the company roll out the use of its AI models in the Greater Bay Area and speed up digital transformation in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the purpose of the corporation is to help promote innovation and technology in Hong Kong by attracting enterprises and professionals with high potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the number of tech start-ups in the city exceeded 4,250 last year.

    Flavoured tobacco ban won't put off visitors: minister

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Sunday said there is no reason to believe that people who use flavoured cigarettes legally at home will be put off visiting Hong Kong by a proposed ban on the products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is among 10 new measures put forward this week to reduce the number of smokers in the SAR, with others including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up if they're in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Lo said he believes visitors won't be dissuaded, noting that tourists still visit Singapore despite its stricter anti-smoking measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People come to Hong Kong not to smoke; they come to Hong Kong for the business opportunities, for our food, for all the tourist attractions. And they love to have a refreshing, lively, healthy city, rather than a city full of smoke and all those cigarette butts on the floor. So I would categorically say that this is not an issue," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also played down concerns raised by newspaper vendors that their businesses would suffer after the ban on flavoured tobacco, which makes up about half of their cigarette sales.

  "For those newspaper vendors, I understand that this is part of their business, but they have other areas of their business. If some of these people are talking about the illicit cigarettes, I guess these are illegal activities and these vendors should not be performing such business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On outlawing smoking while in a queue, Lo said the concept of queuing is easy to understand since most Hongkongers have been taught how to line up since kindergarten. He added that the definition of a queue will be made clearer during the law-making process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health chief also said it's unprecedented that the government raised the tobacco tax for two consecutive years, adding that the authorities will explore whether there is room for a further increase next year.

    CUHK showcases mobile app to diagnose depression

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mobile app developed by the Chinese University has proved to be effective in diagnosing symptoms of depression, and researchers hope the invention can increase people's willingness to seek help at an early stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using artificial intelligence, the app evaluates users' mental status by analysing attributes such as facial expression, voice and language.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A study was conducted between June 2021 and March 2023 to verify the tool's effectiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 180 participants who took part regularly used the app to rate their mood state, and record videos of themselves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers noted that compared to healthy individuals, those suffering from depression tended to frown more and smile less. They also paused more often in their speech and used more negative emotion words.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants also wore devices which measured their rest activity. Data suggested depression patients were less active and suffered from sleep problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The self-assessment can be performed at home, without the need for face-to-face clinical consultations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers hope this will make the tool more palatable to potential patients.

    Authorities to offer help to Zheng Sheng students

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Education Christine Choi on Saturday said authorities will offer assistance to students and staff affected by the closure of Christian Zheng Sheng College, including helping them find new schools or jobs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school, which helps teenagers fight drug addiction, has announced that it will cease operating in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others, including the institution’s head, Alman Chan, were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has issued a statement on Friday, saying it wasn't notified about the closure. It blamed those wanted by the police for the school's financial problems, saying they were trying to avoid responsibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Choi said about 10 students and eight teachers would be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're working with different departments, and the associated school to help the students. If some students want to keep studying, we'll help them find the right programmes. And since students are at different ages, some might want to start working. We'll talk to them about that too. For the teachers, we'll help them with their pay. We'll work with other departments to make sure everything is taken care of,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted the HK$1.8 million that had been earlier allocated to the school through the About Beat Drugs Fund would also be used to help cover the school's daily expenses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the education minister also said that the bureau is starting discussions with the parties involved in the recent dispute over the appointment of interim vice-presidents at the University of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU president Zhang Xiang has accused the university council of bypassing him over the decision. Some former council members of the university also issued a letter to the Chief Executive John Lee, saying they have lost faith in the council's chairperson Priscilla Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi stressed that it's common for a large organisation like a university to have different opinions, saying it's important for everyone involved to share their thoughts openly. She said she’s confident that a decision will be made soon.

    Safeguard national security for a stable HK: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said safeguarding national security is fundamental for a strong and stable Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a national security legal forum in Wan Chai, Lee said national security loopholes were addressed after Basic Law Article 23 legislation took effect in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From the anti-national education movement in 2012, Occupy Central in 2014, the Mong Kok unrest in 2016, to the 2019 social unrest and the Hong Kong version of a 'colour revolution', they used large-scale riots to create unrest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to the central government, decisive action was taken to implement the National Security Law in Hong Kong. It addressed the legal vacuum surrounding national security, it improved the electoral system, and implemented the principle of patriots governing Hong Kong. The city has finally returned to normality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Secretary for Justice Paul Lam said some countries had attempted to ruin Hong Kong's unique role in the nation's development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History tells us that we cannot afford to disregard national security risks. Indeed, security and development have a symbiotic relationship: one cannot exist without the other, and one will benefit the other. This is sheer logic and common sense," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our national security law based on the principles of the rule of law provides high-standard security to guarantee and safeguard the better and sustainable development of Hong Kong in the long run."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-day forum is taking place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.

    NSL demonstrates HK's constitutional duty: Zheng

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said the National Security Law has helped Hong Kong to curb disorder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a national security legal forum in Wan Chai, Zheng Yanxiong said a dual legislation and dual enforcement mechanism between the SAR and the mainland was established after the National Security Law was implemented in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It demonstrates the SAR's constitutional duty. It shows that Hong Kong's mechanisms for safeguarding national security and enforcement have improved, while addressing previous shortcomings - and ensuring that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle is on the right track," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that 45 out of 47 defendants were convicted in a subversion case after they were involved in an unofficial legislative primary election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Different sectors generally affirmed the ruling, believed that it disseminated correct messages on the rule of law, showed the determination and confidence of the society in safeguarding national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nong Rong, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the National Security Law had been effective in improving governance and creating prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past four years, Hong Kong has made a significant transformation from chaos to governance, returning to the track of development. In March, Hong Kong completed legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, further solidifying the legal shield for safeguarding national security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong National Security Law explicitly identifies its purpose as maintaining the prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong SAR, highlighting this original aspiration to protect development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government Dong Jingwei said the central government has full trust in the SAR government, authorising it to have the responsibility for safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the central government would deal with any problems that the SAR government finds difficult to handle.

    HK-born US astronaut Anders dies in plane crash

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ninety-year-old Anders was piloting the plane alone when it went down north of Seattle.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong-born retired US astronaut William Anders, who was one of the first three humans to orbit the moon, capturing the famed "Earthrise" photo during Nasa's Apollo 8 mission in 1968, died on Friday in the crash of a small aeroplane in Washington state. He was 90.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NASA chief Bill Nelson paid tribute to Anders on social media with a post of the iconic image of Earth rising over the lunar horizon, saying the former Air Force pilot "offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Heritage Flight Museum near Burlington, Washington, which he co-founded, confirmed that Anders was killed in an aircraft accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was piloting the plane alone when it went down off the coast of Jones Island, part of the San Juan Islands archipelago north of Seattle, between Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, The Seattle Times reported, citing his son, Greg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to television station KCPQ-TV, a Fox affiliate in Tacoma, Anders, a resident of San Juan County, was at the controls of a vintage Air Force single-engine T-34 Mentor that he owned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed on KCPQ showed a plane plunging from the skies in a steep dive before slamming into the water just offshore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US Naval Academy graduate and Air Force pilot, Anders joined Nasa in 1963 as a member of the third group of astronauts. He did not go into space until December 21, 1968, when Apollo 8 lifted off on the first crewed mission to leave Earth orbit and travel 240,000 miles (386,000 km) to the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was the "rookie" on the crew, alongside Frank Borman, the mission commander, and James Lovell, who had flown with Borman on Gemini 7 in 1965 and later commanded the ill-fated Apollo 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apollo 8, originally scheduled for 1969, was pushed forward because of concerns the Russians were accelerating their own plans for a trip around the moon by the end of 1968. That gave the crew only several months to train for the historic but highly risky mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carried by a Saturn V rocket never before used on a crewed flight and tested only twice, the spacecraft faced the delicate and daunting task of entering and leaving lunar orbit safely. Failure meant crashing into the moon or being forever stranded in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recalling the mission 40 years later, Anders acknowledged that although confident of success, he thought "there was a one-third chance" the crew "didn't come back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trepidation turned to triumph when Apollo 8 reached the moon on Christmas Eve and during its 10 orbits captivated a worldwide television audience of more than a billion people by transmitting the first pictures of the lunar surface just miles below.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key part of the mission was photographing the moon, but "after about the third revolution, the moon was clearly kind of a boring place. There was nothing but holes and holes upon holes," Anders said at a symposium in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts' focus shifted abruptly when the Earth began rising over the lunar surface. "Me, Lovell and Borman suddenly said at once: 'Look at that' - this gorgeous, colourful, beautiful planet of ours coming up over the ugly lunar horizon," Anders told Forbes magazine in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a long lens and colour film, Anders ended up snapping the photograph now known as "Earthrise." The image, vividly capturing both the Earth's beauty and fragility in the vastness of space, is considered one of history's most influential photographs, widely credited with helping inspire the environmental movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Here we came all the way to the moon to discover Earth," Anders later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also played a key role in another indelible episode from that Christmas Eve mission - leading off as the crew read from the Book of Genesis while Apollo 8 transmitted images of the lunar surface to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three astronauts were greeted as national heroes when they splashed down three days later in the Pacific Ocean and were feted as Time magazine's "Men of the Year." (Reuters)

    CS secretary says room for political life in new code

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CS secretary says room for political life in new code" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756610_1_20240608113020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, on Saturday said the new set of rules that government workers must follow wouldn’t restrict them from having a personal political life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The updated Civil Service Code set out 12 core values public servants must follow, including being professional and staying neutral when it comes to politics. It also asked them to not publicly criticise government policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Yeung said civil servants can still take part in social activities or public campaigns during their private time, but they need to be careful about being perceived to represent a government standpoint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have set out very clearly in the code that civil servants can also have their political life. They can join social activities, except where we have strict rules about not being able to join.  But the principle is when they join social activities, they have to ensure that their participation in these social activities will not cause a conflict of interest with their jobs,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And also their joining would not allow people or attract people to believe that they are representing the government's position, the activities they join have government backing or allow people to think that they are actually representing a larger group of civil servants’ views.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted higher rank civil servants, or those taking leadership roles, should be even more cautious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's difficult to draw a solid line below which [rank] you can be very care-free about what you speak and about which you have to be really very cautious. As you move up, I think civil servants will have to really take care,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Yeung was also asked whether the proposed 3 percent pay rise for all civil servants this year, a move that faced strong opposition from unions, would affect morale. The level of increase is significantly lower than the rises of up to 5.47 percent suggested by a pay trend survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that civil servants will be able to understand that there are constraints on what the government can do this year especially given our very tight financial situation and also I think as we progress with our various initiatives to improve livelihood and to improve the economy, there will be recognition of the public on what civil servants have done and this is also something that will be able to boost morale,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that the final decision would be made by the Executive Council, but noted that the room for adjustment is limited.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Young people have become increasingly enthusiastic in visiting the mainland and experiencing the country's development, according to the home and youth affairs chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alice Mak said the number of applications for a cross-border internship programme this year doubled that from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Your Home Address programme broadcast on Saturday, the secretary for home and youth affairs also said Hong Kong is set to host a youth development summit this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will set up a platform for our young people to exchange views and learn from other young people from other countries and areas. We will invite the participation of guest speakers and youth groups from the mainland and overseas, so that Hong Kong's young people can exchange views and learn from their counterparts in other countries," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that there are no fewer than 1,000 participants for the summit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other initiatives targeting young people that have been introduced include a programme for government-backed hostels and an alliance supporting young Hong Kong entrepreneurs in the Greater Bay Area, the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's community work, Mak said she's grateful for the efforts by more than 450 care teams across the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now nearly 5,000 volunteers serving in the care teams. They are willing to contribute to the community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a year's time, we have already visited 90,000 households in the community, and we have provided several thousand services for the residents. These are the achievements that we have made only in a year's time. And I believe, and I trust that, as time goes by, we will enhance our service and we can achieve even more in the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said people volunteering in the care teams not only respond to emergencies such as the recent deadly blaze in Jordan, but also provide services to those in need such as the elderly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Christian Zheng Sheng College, a school that helps students quit drugs, announced it's closing down in a month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The college's supervisor, Chui Hong-sheung, said the decision was made on Thursday night during an online board meeting which he didn't take part in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui pointed out that the cash-strapped college currently has around ten students, and he believes the authorities will make arrangements for them to be transferred elsewhere. He added that some teachers have already quit the school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since there are not many students involved, I think it's highly likely that the authorities can offer them help. But whether or not the students and their parents are willing to be transferred is another matter," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others, including the institution’s head, Alman Chan, were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Christian Zheng Sheng earlier told the press that relevant bank accounts had been frozen by officers as part of the probe, and it was facing dire economic difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government gave the school more than HK$1 million in emergency funding in March, but Chui said the money has since been used up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority said Zheng Sheng College has failed to make MPF contributions for around 20 employees between February and April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it will take follow up action accordingly.

    'Most public flat tenants have completed declarations'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Housing Rosanna Law said on Friday that most public housing tenants suspected of exceeding income and asset limits have made relevant declarations, and those who haven't done so risk having their homes taken back by the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A deadline for some 250,000 so-called "rich tenants" to declare their income and assets passed at the end of last month. People with too much money have to leave their public flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said around 88 percent of tenants have made declarations, and officials will send letters to the rest next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said those who still don't make declarations could see their tenancy terminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will remind you again, that if you wish to continue living in the flat, I will give you a deadline to fill in the declaration form and provide a written reply explaining the late submission," Law said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said those who don't return the form or fail to provide a clear explanation would be considered to have decided not to extend their tenancy, and the flats will be taken back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discretion will be exercised if tenants report family members have been out of Hong Kong or in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the latest round of declarations, officials have taken back more than 1,200 flats, Law said. The units will be reallocated after renovation work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said officials are aware of reports that some public flat tenants have been seen driving luxury cars with cross-boundary licence plates. She said in some cases, investigations will be carried out to see whether there has been any wrongdoing in terms of income and asset checks.

    PolyU device samples soil from far side of moon

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University on Friday said equipment it developed has enabled China’s Chang’e-6 space mission to sample soil from the far side of the moon – the first such feat in history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Yung Kai-leung, director of the university's Research Centre for Deep Space Explorations, said their sampling system, unlike those used by other countries, is fully automated, which means it can prevent contamination and is more efficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The device consists of two shovel and claw-shaped samplers, two monitoring cameras, as well as a packaging system, Yung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automated process involves the cameras selecting an area to sample, before the samplers collect the soil and put it into a container.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The academic said it took his team at the university six years to design and manufacture the sampling system, as it is no easy task operating on the far side of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We still experience communication problems. So we had to modify the method of regolith acquisition so that we can speed up the acquisition, sealing and packing. We had to upgrade our design,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung said he believes that more than 1.75 kg of lunar soil was collected during an operation on Monday, and the material will be of scientific significance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The lunar regolith, especially those on the far side, are subject to a rigorous environment of space radiation, meteorites and things like that. So they contain a lot of useful elements that we may not be able to find on Earth.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the samples may also help scientists better understand the formation of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang’e 6-spacecraft is expected to return to Earth on June 25.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The youth sports ground at the Kai Tak Sports Park will be the first public venue to use "lay and pay" technology for the pitch, with officials saying it should provide more stability and flexibility when organising events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The venue will be available for events including football and rugby matches, as well as school sports days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Managers of the sports park say about 650 rolls of turf, each measuring 1.2 metres by 10 metres, were harvested in Zhuhai and transported to Hong Kong for installation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hybrid turf consists of 95 percent natural grass and five percent artificial grass fibres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malcolm Caddies, a general manager at sports venue management company ASM Global, said the turf can minimise the chances of matches being called off due to unstable conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hybrid surface is way more stable, way more secure. You're not going to get soggy fields like you traditionally do in wet conditions, so it will certainly allow for more matches in inclement weather," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caddies added that a rain harvesting system, which can drain about 1,000 millimetres of rain per hour, has been installed underneath the sports ground to deal with extreme weather.

    Flavoured cigarette ban will deter visitors: lawmaker

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to ban flavoured cigarettes will deter some tourists and businesspeople from coming to Hong Kong, a lawmaker warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is among 10 new measures aimed at reducing the number of smokers in the city, with others including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up if they're in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu told RTHK he was worried some people would think twice about coming to Hong Kong when they hear about the flavoured cigarette ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Fruit-flavoured cigarettes are sold in all parts of the world. Assuming people are not allowed to purchase these cigarettes, it would mean that their freedom of choice is being restricted,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If some of these people are used to smoking fruit-flavoured cigarettes in their own countries, and they visit Hong Kong where such products are prohibited, they would then think twice before travelling to the SAR for tourism or business.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Henry Tong, who chairs the Council on Smoking and Health, said he was in favour of the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really welcome the government's new measure... banning flavoured tobacco products would make cigarette smoking much less attractive to young people and female smokers," he said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Secretary for Health, Eddie Lee, meanwhile, said the government is adopting a "gradual and systemic" approach to making smoking culturally unacceptable in Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bar Association on Friday expressed regret over the resignations of two top court judges, and said their departure would not affect the court's judicial functions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its remarks came after two non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption, both from the UK – tendered their resignations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Bar respects their personal decision and is also grateful for their contributions to the development of our jurisprudence and the rule of law in Hong Kong," the association wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Bar strongly believes that their resignations will not affect the ability of our apex court in discharging its judicial functions and has every confidence in the independence of our judicial system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Law Society said it is grateful to all current and past non-permanent judges for their "faithful and fearless discharge of their important role in the administration of justice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its president Chan Chak-ming said the society supports keeping overseas non-permanent judges in Hong Kong, as stated in the Basic Law.

    Tobacco control experts welcome new anti-smoking moves

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Judith Mackay from Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control also said she had never met a smoker who wanted to keep smoking. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756456_1_20240607092658.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert in tobacco control has hailed the government's latest moves to bring down the smoking rate, but she says that more measures will be needed going forward especially when it comes to stopping young people from smoking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, the director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control, Judith Mackay, said the short-term measures, including banning flavoured cigarettes, were spot on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it is really important that the government has done this," she said. "I mean we still have 600,000 smokers in Hong Kong and we know that 400,000 of them will die from tobacco."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay also said governments needed to think of new ways to tackle smoking going forward and this included banning the sale of cigarettes to people born after a certain date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think you can divide tobacco control into two areas. One is existing measures and extending them," she said. "But then we also have to think of new measures and to try to be innovative, particularly in terms of young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay said the idea of having a smoke-free generation had been considered in New Zealand and the UK but had been stymied by changes in government. She said it didn't surprise her that the SAR government hadn't included a ban on sales of tobacco to people born before a certain date in its latest measures but that it was still on the books.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the government proposed a blanket ban on E-cigarettes, flavoured cigarettes and lighting up while in a queue, as part of moves designed to bring about a "cultural change". Other planned measures include removing branding from cigarette packaging and heightening health warnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay also said she had never met a smoker who wanted to keep smoking. She said parents who smoked also didn't want their children to smoke as it was dangerous and expensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Henry Tong - who chairs the Council on Smoking and Health - said vapes and flavoured cigarettes have been shown to be particularly attractive to young smokers and female smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The survey yesterday that the government released shows that about 70 percent of female smokers and young smokers smoke flavoured tobacco products," he said while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme. "And vapes, e-cigarettes, these are trendy products. They are attractive to young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong said banning the possession of e-cigarettes was the second half of the government's action against the product, after it banned their importation, manufacture and sale two years ago. He said he really welcomed the government's measure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Health Secretary, Lo Chung-mau, has said the government plans to reduce the smoking prevalence rate to to 7.8 [ercent next year from the current 9.1 percent.

 Police said they had arrested three people who allegedly insulted the national anthem ahead of a World Cup qualifying match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China were playing against Iran at the Hong Kong Stadium on Thursday in a 2026 World Cup qualifying match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said three people, aged between 18 and 31, turned their backs towards the pitch when the national anthem was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were arrested on suspicion of insulting the national anthem, and are being detained for further investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Anthem Ordinance came into effect in 2020, stating that people must stand solemnly and must not behave in a disrespectful way when the national anthem is played.

 The Judiciary said two non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption, both from the UK – have tendered their resignations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung of the Court of Final Appeal “notes with regret” the resignations. He said overseas non-permanent judges, including Lords Collins and Sumption, have made valuable contributions to the top court over the years, and that the Judiciary is committed to upholding the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive, John Lee, also expressed regret at the resignations. Lee noted that Lord Collins had stated that he continued to "have the fullest confidence in the Court and the total independence of its members."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Secretary for Justice, Paul Lam, said the Department of Justice expresses regret at the judges' resignations, but was grateful for their past contributions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Collins has been a non-permanent judge of Hong Kong’s highest court since 2011, Lord Sumption since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the pair’s resignations, there are four Hong Kong non-permanent judges and eight non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions at the Court of Final Appeal, with Justice Allsop from Australia the most recent appointee earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum number of non-permanent judges is 30.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and opposed the House of Representatives of the United States Congress for introducing a resolution which it said “smeared and slandered” the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance as well as law enforcement actions taken by HKSAR law enforcement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR administration said, "The US House of Representatives grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China, violating international law and the basic norms governing international relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSAR will not be intimidated and will continue to resolutely safeguard national security in accordance with the law," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also said the US was "in no position to point its finger" at the SAR for legitimately passing legislation to safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the SAR's legal framework in safeguarding national security was in line with international human rights standards, and the extraterritorial effect for the offences endangering national security also fully aligns with the principles of international law.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Thursday said it planned to invite eligible red minibus operators to switch to green routes next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the government consulted the sector last month and received positive feedback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It planned to invite red minibus route operators, who had already joined the HK$2 fare scheme, to switch to green routes, to further ensure the quality of minibus services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said about 70 red minibus routes had joined the fare scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said criteria would be set for those who wished to go green, such as requiring minibus routes to operate for at least five years, have only one fixed route and offer whole-day services, and the route must be run by only one operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to invite eligible red minibus operators to switch to green routes within the month of July, and the department said it would ensure all routes meet the conditions for operating public light buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, red minibuses are allowed to operate across the territory, and their routes, frequency and fares are not subject to any restrictions.

    CE urged to step in to end HKU appointment conflict

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former council members and alumni of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have called on Chief Executive John Lee to put an end to the infighting at the institution, saying they had lost faith in the council's chairperson Priscilla Wong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They wrote a letter to Lee, who is also the university's chancellor, saying the council had appointed several interim vice-presidents without consulting HKU president and vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the council is tasked with giving advice and monitoring HKU's management, but does not directly deal with administrative affairs, adding the body's move had sparked conflicts in HKU and affected its normal operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Lee to step in promptly, or people would have the impression the government had appointed the council chairperson to control HKU and sideline the president, which would harm Hong Kong's international image.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the letter's signatories, former executive councillor Fanny Law, told RTHK she "doesn't have an opinion on who should be the vice-presidents," but she cared about the procedures, HKU's reputation and the city's image.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party legislator Regina Ip, who sits on HKU's court, an overseeing and legislative body comprising university and lay members, said she hopes the conflict can be settled soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personally I think vice-presidents are part of the president's team. No matter who has the power to appoint them, they should consult the president thoroughly. It's better if the president gets along with the vice-presidents and they can work together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Chief Executive's Office said Lee had asked the Education Bureau to comprehend the situation before reporting to him, adding that people would expect HKU, a successful university, to have good governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang had earlier criticised the council's action in an email to HKU teaching staff and students, saying it violated established procedures and severely undermined the institution's "century-old academic autonomy".

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A survey by Hong Kong Unison revealed that about 57 percent of Nepalese individuals found discrimination to be a serious problem in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A group advocating for racial equality on Thursday called on the government to offer language and cultural courses to Nepalese parents and youths to help them integrate into Hong Kong society and prepare them with skills for better employment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A survey by Hong Kong Unison found that one in five Nepalese youths had been sent back to Nepal by their parents for reasons including family problems, forced marriage and drug abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Tse, executive director of the organisation, said authorities need to boost education measures to help local Nepalese youths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They should really put their top priority in the field of education, particularly in the learning of Chinese so that if Nepalese students are doing well in school, hopefully they would be successful in their academic career and then have some sort of social mobility," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, unfortunately, because of the language barrier and the lack of education, many of them can't finish secondary school. Even if they can finish secondary school, they would end up finding a really low-level kind of job which is not really good for them in the long run."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 268 adolescents and young adults were interviewed, with almost half saying their biggest concern was the language barrier and the lack of educational support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Limbu Eliza, a Nepalese youth who was born and raised in Hong Kong, said she personally struggled with discrimination and learning Cantonese growing up, which made schooling and finding a job very difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most companies don't hire our ethnic minority (EM) people. Whenever they see you are EM people, [they] don't want to hire you. They will just reject you immediately. No need for interview, you can just go, which is I think unfair for us," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of them, even though they know Cantonese, but [companies] judge us by our colour, our face, our culture, and that is why they will always reject us. I think that is the most difficult thing [about] finding a job in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation also recommended special programmes tailored to Nepalese individuals to combat drug abuse, after the survey noted 70 percent of youth found drug abuse to be a significant problem.

<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK understands that a man known for challenging government policies in court has been arrested on suspicion of scamming the authorities out of different kinds of social benefits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested a man surnamed Kwok, 85, in Cheung Chau on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said he's Kwok Cheuk-kin, often known as the king of judicial reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the man is suspected of making false statements over his income and assets, for the alleged purpose of deceiving the government to receive subsidies such as public housing, fruit money, social security and legal aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the alleged deception took place between 2013 and 2022, and the arrest was made after thorough investigation by the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the suspect was released on bail and stressed that fraud carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in jail.

    E-cigarettes, smoking in a queue to be banned

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-cigarettes, flavoured cigarettes and lighting up while in a queue are set to be banned in Hong Kong, as part of measures designed to bring about a "cultural change" when it comes to smoking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A ban on selling or importing alternative smoking products (ASP) came into force more than two years ago, but it is still legal to possess them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee on Thursday said the government plans to outlaw e-cigarettes and similar products completely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One should not be able to have any legal means to purchase or to get hold of such ASP. So anyone who is still using ASP currently... presumably they are using the stocks that they purchased before April 2022," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So a reasonable assumption is that by a certain time... if they possessed any ASP, should have already consumed all of the remaining leftover."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other planned measures aimed at cutting the number of smokers in the SAR include removing branding from cigarette packaging and a ban on smoking while in queues for public transport, theme parks or medical facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoke-free areas will also be extended to the entrances and exits of all childcare centres, schools and homes for the elderly. The fine for smoking in smoke-free areas will be doubled to HK$3,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Existing laws banning the sale of cigarettes to under-18s will be extended to cover those who offer them to minors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The key principle is that we want to protect our youngsters, our next generation. So what we are doing now is actually an education process, a cultural change, a behavioural change," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think another important aspect is that through education and promotion, we will educate our young people that they should not receive tobacco products. At the same time, we send a very clear message to the adults that one should not sell, nor should one provide such tobacco products to our young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said the harm of smoking should not be sugar-coated, so flavoured cigarettes will also be banned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These flavoured cigarettes with additives are actually like an advertisement trying to hide the irritating taste of the smoke and at the same time hiding the harmful effect of all these tobacco products to make it like a sugar coating on a toxic product," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To combat illicit cigarettes, the government will introduce a duty-paid cigarette labelling system and double the fine for smuggling illicit cigarettes to HK$2 million, while increasing the jail term from two to seven years. In addition, the government will continue to increase tobacco duty to discourage smoking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said the government aims to table the legislative amendments required before the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael, a cigarette smoker, told RTHK that more people will use conventional tobacco products when electronic cigarettes are completely banned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that would be illegal, then more people would be returning to buying cigarettes. Because most of them, they try to quit smoking with the electronic cigarettes such as vape," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But then now, if they're going to ban it, then I think it'll be much more difficult for people to quit smoking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-smoker surnamed Chan said she welcomes the government's plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I don't smoke, I support it. I don't really want to inhale second-hand smoke. In the past, for example, when queuing or taking the elevator, there would often be someone next to me smoking. I would just walk away. I wouldn't hang around," she said.

    Privacy watchdog clears exams body over charges

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Privacy Commissioner says the exams regulator didn't violate the law regarding charges for marking record and exam script checks. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756346_1_20240606154522.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog on Thursday dismissed complaints the local exams regulator had violated privacy laws by overcharging public exam candidates for their marking records and exam script checks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The law stipulates that organisations cannot charge a fee higher than the lowest possibly imposed for people seeking a copy of their personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Examinations and Assessment Authority turned electronic and stopped providing hard copies for those seeking their records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It lowered the fee for checking the first subject by HK$20 to HK$380, and kept the fee for each additional subject unchanged at HK$104.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four candidates who sat last year's DSE exams then filed complaints to the Privacy Commissioner, saying they were charged too much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an investigation, privacy commissioner Ada Chung said the fees charged were already lower than the directly related necessary costs, such as those for payroll and computer operating time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The commissioner found that the fees imposed by the [authority] for complying with the data access requests were not excessive and it had not contravened [the ordinance]," she said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One complainant also argued the exams body had been overcharging for a decade starting from 2012, saying it actually retained scanned copies of the records but only gave people hard copies.

  <br/>
  But Chung also said this was unsubstantiated, saying the authority was only providing the data in one form and therefore didn't violate the law.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There will be more cooperation between the creative industries in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, Culture Secretary Kevin Yeung said on Thursday at an annual meeting on cultural exchanges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “This year's meeting has been very successful, with many collaborative projects showing positive development. It's very encouraging,” he said at the 22nd Greater Pearl River Delta Cultural Cooperation Meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope that this conference framework will guide cultural exchange and cooperation between the three regions, and elevate the depth and breadth of our collaboration to a new level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that over the next five years, the SAR government will allocate HK$135 million to support local art groups and artists in exchange programmes within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also plans to bring more local cultural events, including the Hong Kong Pop Culture Festival, to the bay area, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong’s culture and tourism director general, Li Bin, said creating a well-known cultural tourism brand in the region is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that promotions for art performances and exhibitions will be more closely connected, with more interactions among official accounts on WeChat, Douyin and Xiaohongshu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Macau’s cultural affairs minister, Leong Wai-man, said the city hosted over 2,000 large-scale performances and more than 10,000 cultural events last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Macau could play the role as a major entertainment hub in the bay area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific on Thursday announced that it will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, from October 28.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airline has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi Air Connectivity Program, which comes under Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Cathay Pacific’s CEO Ronald Lam said the new flights will help business and tourism prosper in both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Riyadh is a very vibrant city. It is the capital and financial centre of Saudi Arabia. By having direct flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh, we will be contributing to the prosperity of business, trade and tourism between China and Saudi Arabia,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme's CEO, Majid Khan, said the launch of the direct flights will bring more tourists to both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is one of the key markets in terms of tourism and trade from both sides. So we believe Cathay, we're going to grow the point-to-point traffic from both sides between Hong Kong and Riyadh and vice versa, but also the traffic to domestic Saudi Arabia and to the network beyond Hong Kong, where Cathay has a vast network,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay axed a previous service to Riyadh in 2017.

    Govt highlights HK and China's strengths

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The SAR government has issued a statement setting the record straight about both the SAR and China. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756265_1_20240606003614.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday hit back at criticism by "some individuals" of the city's  economic and financial development, which it said had "clearly overlooked the existing advantages and the current positive development momentum of Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said in a statement that it intended to set the record straight, saying China's real economic growth rates in the first quarter and for all of 2023 were both above five percent, "ranking it among the fastest-growing major economies in the world".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It quoted an International Monetary Fund study which had concluded that the Mainland economy contributed to more than 30 per cent of global economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the SAR was also growing steadily, increasing by 3.3 per cent in 2023, and notching up year-on-year real gross domestic product growth of 2.7 percent. It said it was estimated to grow by 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also defended the city's status as a financial hub, saying Hong Kong stocks market capitalisaion exceeds HK$33 trillion, which is 10 times higher than at the time of the handover in 1997, while Stock Connect had also brought about a cumulative northbound and southbound capital flows of more than 1.8 trillion yuan and HK$3.1 trillion respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These figures demonstrate that Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, has fully utilised its ability to mobilise both Mainland and foreign capital, and will continue to play a key role in helping to 'bring in' international enterprises and investors, as well as assisting mainland enterprises to 'go out',"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also singled out other highlights in the stock market, including the average daily transaction volume of Exchange Traded Funds on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange exceeding HK$13 billion in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the China Securities Regulatory Commission had also recently announced five new measures to support the development of Hong Kong's financial sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the one country, two systems principle was the cornerstone of the city's prosperity, and the Basic Law protected freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its successful implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law and Safeguarding National Security Ordinance had "brought about a safe and stable environment conducive to investment and financial development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Early this year, a survey conducted by a major foreign chamber of commerce reflected that nearly 80 per cent of its members interviewed had confidence in the rule of law in Hong Kong, and nearly 70 per cent of them also indicated that the operation of their enterprises had not been affected by the National Security Law," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It underlined Hong Kong's status in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Various data and facts not only reflect the performance of Hong Kong's economic and financial development, but more importantly, highlight Hong Kong's unique advantages and strategic position under the 'one country, two systems' principle, as well as its resilience and flexibility, in the face of global instability," it said. "Despite the fact that external environment will remain complicated, the Mainland and Hong Kong's economic growth is steadily improving, and even in a faster pace than some developed economies."

    HKU head says wasn't told about new appointments

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756251_1_20240605220920.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president and vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Zhang Xiang, on Wednesday confirmed he wasn't told about new senior staff appointments by the HKU council, saying it severely undermined the institution's "century-old academic autonomy".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an email to HKU teaching staff and students, Zhang said the council's move to appoint several interim vice-presidents without consulting him violated established procedures and disregarded the fundamentals of good governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the University of Hong Kong Ordinance and Statutes, the president was granted the authority to appoint temporary senior management officers, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Neither were the nominations for these interim vice-presidents recommended by me, nor was I consulted about them. The university management did not have prior knowledge of these appointments at all," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stability and development of our University, as well as the reputation of Hong Kong, are now at risk, not to mention the negative impact on our efforts to attract global talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes reportedly include a demotion for Richard Wong, Zhang’s right-hand man and deputy vice-chancellor, who had served as the university’s interim provost since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that Wong had been appointed as a vice-president and would oversee institutional advancement, while his original post would be taken up by Vivian Yam, a professor at the science faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Zhang said he was thrilled that HKU had ranked higher than ever before in the new QS World University Rankings, adding he was dedicated to leading the institution to new heights and positioning it alongside the world's leading universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU climbed up nine places to 17 on QS’s list of the world’s top universities.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 16,000 pupils - or 84 percent of the intake - were accepted into their top three schools in this year's central allocation of Primary One places on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau earlier announced that a total of 19,204 children took part in the central allocation exercise, and the overall satisfaction rate was 92.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau reminded parents to register their child with the school allocated from next Tuesday to Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some parents were happy with the outcome, while others went to their targeted schools for interviews as a last resort to compete for the remaining few places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parent lined up outside a primary school in Yau Ma Tei from 9am for "door knocking" and tried his luck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We live nearby and the school is famous. [My kid] has prepared by earning some certificates and participated in competitions. But I'm not very optimistic, because the school is quite popular," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the Confucian Tai Shing Primary School in Wong Tai Sin said it was unfair that it was only allowed to operate one Primary One class instead of two, saying it had admitted at least 31 pupils this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the bureau said the decision was based on established mechanisms because the total number of students admitted was less than 41.

    New teaching kit to help autistic teens make friends

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two social welfare groups on Wednesday introduced a new teaching kit to help teenagers with autism make friends, saying they often find it hard to fit in.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Family Planning Association and Wai Ji Christian Service worked together to design games and story cards that teach autistic teens to interact with others in different social scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maggie Fung, a clinical psychologist with the Christian group, said autistic children struggle to read other people’s emotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Their main difficulty is they don't really recognise the facial expression or the reaction from others. Therefore, they might have a lot of difficulties recognising their reaction and coming up with an appropriate response to them,” she said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Wai-wai, an education officer from the association, said the teaching kit helps them understand what's expected in social situations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With these stories shown to them, they can actually say, 'Oh, this is what people expected, this is what's going wrong.' So they can learn from seeing. They can learn from understanding,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report published by the Census and Statistics Department showed that 22,400 people are living with autism in Hong Kong as of 2020, making up 0.3 percent of the total population.

    Subpar taxi fleets could be banned: authorities

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government hopes new taxi fleets will drive up service quality. File photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756208_1_20240605164135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New taxi fleets set to hit the streets of Hong Kong could be suspended from doing business if their service quality isn't up to scratch, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department is currently vetting 15 applications for taxi fleet licences, with up to five successful bidders expected to be announced in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to questions from lawmaker Edward Leung, Acting Transport Secretary Liu Chun-san said taxi fleet operators will need to take part in a mid-term appraisal and their performance would be taken into account should they wish to renew their licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transport commissioner would be able to initiate an inquiry should a fleet fail to meet the required standards and a number of sanctions would be available, such as a licence suspension or withdrawing certain taxis from the fleet, Liu said in a written reply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year saw a 75 percent surge in complaints against taxi drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-third of the 1,006 cases filed to the authorities were related to drivers refusing hire, while another 340 cabbies were accused of overcharging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But authorities cautioned that the jump in complaints came against a low base of comparison in 2022, when Hong Kong was still curtailed by Covid restrictions.
