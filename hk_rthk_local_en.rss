<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said it called the police over a Light Rail service disruption case in Yuen Long, saying it suspected that a truck hit and damaged overhead cables.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rail company said the incident happened at around 2pm, and the affected section was near the Shui Pin Wai Stop, which is next to Yuen Long Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had arranged free shuttle buses to get affected passengers around, as workers conducted emergency repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Light Rail routes, including 610, 614, 615, 671P and 751, had to be diverted.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local NGO, Agency for Volunteer Service, on Thursday said more than 54 percent of those it surveyed had taken part in organised volunteer service over the last three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its survey of more than 770 people, conducted last month, showed about 40 percent of participants volunteered through a charity or NGO. Melissa Pang, chairwoman of the agency, said reaching out to organisations to indicate a willingness to volunteer was an important first step for those looking to do volunteer work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it is very important for them to get attached to an NGO or a school or other organisations who can provide more attractive scheme of volunteering. Sometimes they [the people looking to volunteer] might have the wish, 'oh I can spare an hour now to volunteer.' However, they might not find the appropriate work to do," Pang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey also found that the economic value of volunteer service in 2023 was the equivalent to almost HK$11 billion, double the amount in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Kwong, assistant professor at Heng Seng University, said that on a scale of five, with five being the happiest, people who volunteered were happier than those who didn't.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added a new research indicator had been created that would analyse participants' interest and input in volunteering, as well as the impact it creates. The data collected would help reflect a realistic picture of Hong Kong's organised volunteering efforts.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year's Hong Kong Streetathon say participants will get a unique experience that engages all their senses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The day will include a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, as well as a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon", local delicacies will be dished out to runners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This, organisers say, will satisfy the gustatory sense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There'll be music and fragrance diffusers in parts of the route for the auditory and olfactory senses, while the scenes of Victoria Harbour, various performances, and high fives from the sidelines will satisfy the visual and tactile senses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we aim to create the most meaningful marathon by bringing the first ever 'Five-senses Marathon' into the event to enhance the overall running experience," said Andes Leung, CEO and co-founder of organiser RunOurCity Foundation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said this year's marathon not only promises a fun running experience, but is also partnered with 25 charities and NGOs to advocate for the seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Streetathon will include a family event, the Asian YOUTHRUN 10K race, designed to encourage students to participate in long-distance running activities to promote physical fitness and a healthy lifestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Streetathon will be held on December 8, with registration for the full and half marathon, and the 10K race beginning on July 25.

    Legco lowers compulsory land sales threshold
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco lowers compulsory land sales threshold" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762099_1_20240718124251.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Developers hoping to knock down old residential blocks might not have to work as hard to get flat owners to agree in future, under changes to the law approved by Legco on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At present, developers need the backing of at least 80 percent of owners to trigger a compulsory land sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new law, thresholds as low as 65 percent will apply, depending on the age of a building and its location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lowest percentage will apply to buildings across the city that are at least 70 years old, as well as any block older than 60 years in the designated areas of Wan Chai, Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei, Cheung Sha Wan, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, To Kwa Wan and Tsuen Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current 80 percent threshold will remain in place for buildings outside the designated areas that are between 50 and 60 years old, while developers will need to get the blessing of 70 percent of owners of blocks aged between 60 and 70 outside the designated areas, as well as those in buildings aged between 50 and 60 in the designated areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Development minister Bernadette Linn brushed off calls by some lawmakers for the pace of redevelopments to be slowed down because of the sluggish economy and housing market, saying addressing the issue of ageing buildings is an urgent matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while sceptics may think the changes are to benefit developers, they are actually aimed at helping society at large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most important objective is to expedite redevelopment of old and debilitated buildings, to assist building owners in addressing the building hazards and improving the living environment for all," Linn said in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every now and then, we learn from the media criticisms about our approach, and that only private developers benefit from this policy [amendment], but this is not true."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said her bureau and the Urban Renewal Authority will both set up dedicated offices to offer more support for homeowners affected by redevelopment plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said that if all goes smoothly, the new thresholds could come into effect by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most councillors spoke in support of the law changes. An amendment motion moved by Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen to keep the threshold at 80 percent in the designated areas was voted down.

    Watchdog apologises over Nongfu water row

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday apologised to mainland bottled water and beverages company Nongfu Spring after the firm threatened legal action over a report it condemned as erroneous and "massively damaging" to its reputation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an article in the watchdog's latest CHOICE magazine – which suggested people should stop buying bottled water altogether and make do with tap water – the council noted that every litre of Nongfu Spring's bottled water contains three microgrammes of the potential carcinogen bromate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that three microgrammes is the maximum amount permitted in mineral water under European Union regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, which also covered a number of other bottled water brands, prompted an angry response from Nongfu Spring, which complained that its product should not be categorised as mineral water but "natural drinking water".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's limit for bromate in drinking water is 10 microgrammes per litre, more than three times higher than the level permitted in mineral water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the council said it has reclassified the product in question as "natural drinking water" after holding a meeting with Nongfu Spring representatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also adjusted its rating of the product, from 4.5 stars to the maximum five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council reiterated that all 30 water products it tested in the study were found to be safe to drink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring also issued a statement noting that the council has found its product to be fully compliant with the relevant standards.

    West Kowloon arts hub plans to sell land in batches

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Betty Fung, on Thursday said land for residential developments at the arts hub site will be sold in two or three batches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fung said the authorities will work with private developers on land sales for homes, but not for hotels and offices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because as a blueprint for diversified property development, we think it is best to keep some properties to ourselves for rental income."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank, Ryan Ip, said private residential developments at the cultural district should incorporate art elements and have areas that are open to the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Development Bureau has to act as a gatekeeper to make sure the whole project will not become a pure luxury residential project just like you can find anywhere in the city," Ip said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A project that can be seamlessly integrated within the West Kowloon Cultural District by, for example, adding in arts and culture elements in its design and also allowing the public to use some of the public open space within the residential projects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip said the land parcels are in a prime location and could bring in HK$15 billion for the authority, which is currently losing around HK$700 million a year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man from Hong Kong has been arrested in Singapore on suspicion of drug trafficking, SAR police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said it had contacted counterparts in Singapore over suspicions that gangs in Hong Kong were sending people there to smuggle drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Singaporean officers arrested a 25-year-old man as he was allegedly handing over a box to a logistics company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR police said four kilogrammes of methamphetamine worth around HK$3 million was found inside two statues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man was detained pending further investigation, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau said anyone found guilty of trafficking more than 250 grammes of methamphetamine can face the death penalty.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lands Department on Wednesday announced the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Hung Kai Properties beat 10 other bidders and won the tender for a site in Siu Lek Yuen, Sha Tin, for HK$619 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site is expected to generate around 280 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the only residential plot on offer in the April-June quarter under the government land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Victor Lui, said the company will build small and medium-sized units there, with a total investment of around HK$2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kathy Lee, head of research at Colliers, said the government's first successful sale of residential land after scrapping property-cooling measures in February sent a positive message to the market, amid concerns that developers were reluctant to bid for land.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All qualified swimmers will be allowed to participate in the long course championships held by the Hong Kong China Swimming Association in November, regardless of their affiliated club's membership status.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This emerged from a meeting on Wednesday held by the association, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, as well as former SAR team swimmer Alex Fong and other representatives, after a nine-year-old swimmer from Fong's club was barred from competing due to its low ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the meeting, president of the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, Ronnie Wong, said the body is looking to reform their membership and appeal mechanisms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The swimming association will use a scoring system to determine club membership, regularly assessing how well the club is doing in different areas such as organising events, promoting swimming in district level, training swimmers and top athletes, and the number of top athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They will also set up a system for moving up or down in rank. Clubs that perform well can be upgraded and those that fail to meet standards may be downgraded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that suggestions put forth by Fong and New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho, which include increasing transparency in the three-tier membership system and revision of the composition of the swimming association's executive committee, will be discussed in a later executive committee meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Fok, sports sector lawmaker and vice president of the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, described the meeting as positive, adding that all parties reached a consensus to improve the sport of swimming in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that he hopes the controversy could come to an end and people can focus on supporting the SAR team in the upcoming Olympic Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong, with the government hoping it could help resolve an acute shortage of nurses in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials project that in 2030, Hong Kong will see a general nurse shortage of 8,700, with the number falling to 6,000 in 2040.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legal amendment introduces a new pathway allowing non-locally trained nurses to work in the SAR through special registration, without the need to pass local licensing exams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is subject to them having worked full-time for five years at specified institutions, and that their employers confirm they were satisfied with their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another pathway, there will also be limited registration or enrolment for the admission of non-locally trained nurses to serve in premises such as care homes, social welfare service units and nurse training schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current amendments to the Nurses Registration Ordinance do not seek to change the role of locally-trained healthcare professionals as the backbone of our healthcare system," health minister Lo Chung-mau told lawmakers before the passage of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Admitting non-locally trained nurses is an effective measure to address the local nurse shortage in the short term, so that Hong Kong's shortfall of healthcare professionals does not undermine the quality of healthcare and care home services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many lawmakers spoke in support of the bill, but they also expressed concern the new arrivals would need training and would need to overcome language barriers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said while bringing in non-locally trained nurses could ease the pressure of overburdened staff, he said he thinks it's not just a matter of "adding up the numbers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government needs to ensure service quality and that there would be sufficient supervision, especially at care homes.

    Exco conditionally approves arts hub funding plan
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kevin Yeung (right) says the funding plan will help the hub stay afloat for at least 10 years. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761981_1_20240717170517.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council has conditionally agreed to a funding proposal to allow the cash-strapped West Kowloon arts hub to sell some of its land parcels to ease a financial shortfall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority will be allowed to sell residential developments within Zone 2 of the site and keep all proceeds received from tenders to private developers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This means the development of residential blocks in the zone will no longer be restricted by the “Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) only" model adopted since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Culture minister Kevin Yeung on Wednesday said the plan will help the hub stay afloat for at least a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past few years, with very great effort of the authority, the BOT tender did not seem to meet with the appetites of the contractors or developers in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Instead of having a constant stream of income in the many years in future, we are now cashing in for a lump sum upfront, which could help release the financial challenges or the requirement at present."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority will have to meet certain requirements, including a triennial cap on operating deficits and a cap on the percentage of staff costs in relation to the total annual operating expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body's chairman, Henry Tang, said they can now avoid "drastic" cost-cutting measures such as reducing the number of days each week that the M+ museum is open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added that the authority will come up with ways to boost income without adding to the strain on the public coffers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to operate as we have always done under a discipline that we only spend what we need to spend and we will control our costs diligently and very seriously," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are ways that I can make more revenue without disrupting the operations of the museums and I will look for ways to do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the funding arrangement and its financial woes, DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng said the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority should explore more sources of income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority or the CSTB (Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) has to do more to make this hub an international culture arts hub," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this moment, we don't see they have a lot of different kinds of income, no matter the ticketing, renting the places... We do think there're a lot of different opportunities. So we hope that the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority do explore more different kinds of income strategies."

    Take advantage of 'panda economy': DAB

<img alt="Regina Ip (centre) says the government should set up a joint-immigration checkpoint at Hong Kong International Airport." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761972_2_20240717160539.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB urged the government to make good use of the two incoming pandas as a means to promote the local economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as the party submitted its Policy Address recommendations to Chief Executive John Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Council on Wednesday, DAB lawmaker Holden Chow said the “panda economy” could benefit the tourism, catering, and cultural sectors in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We very much look forward to these pandas coming to Hong Kong, and that would definitely boost our tourism," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the chief executive [in his Policy Address] would very much focus on the economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the New People's Party (NPP) said the government should set up a joint-immigration checkpoint at Hong Kong International Airport, to strengthen the SAR's status as an aviation hub by improving connectivity with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after submitting the NPP's Policy Address recommendations, the party’s chairwoman Regina Ip said co-location checkpoints are popular as they make travel to the mainland easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Co-location is nothing new. We already have co-location at the Shenzhen Bay control point and there will be more co-location facilities in the Greater Bay Area, and it's very popular with the visitors and with the travellers. So I don't think it will raise any legal problems. Of course, suitable legal amendments will need to be made,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the government should look at ways to attract locals and mainlanders to stay in Hong Kong over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Council, Tien said many Hongkongers are travelling north because the cost of living in the city is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whatever you buy in Hong Kong is more expensive than you can get for the same thing in Shenzhen. That's why a lot of Hong Kong people no longer spend their weekends in Hong Kong. So how do we tackle that? We suggest that we need to go high-end, to move up the market," he said.

    Govt asks CLP to speed up lightning rod installation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tse Chin-wan said he hopes CLP can install 500 lightning rods at power supply facilities in two years." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761957_1_20240717150415.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he has urged power company CLP to speed up the installation of more lightning rods, as part of efforts to avoid power outages caused by extreme weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In response to a question in the legislature, the minister said the company reported 26 "significant" outages in the past three years, 10 of which were caused by external factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said he met CLP's senior management on Tuesday to discuss recent blackouts and stopping bad weather affecting the power supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He cited the power company as saying it plans to install another 100 rods in two years at facilities such as transmission towers, but said he asked them to do 500 instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The plans are not taken forward fast enough. They're expecting in two years' time they can install 100 more such [devices], but I think this is a bit too slow," Tse told lawmakers at a council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker William Wong asked officials to lay more underground cables, so there would be less external disruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said in response that this has been the practice in new towns, but CLP still has lots of outdoor facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that the power company has told him that in the event of outages, it would deploy more manpower to help residents, as well as using mobile power supply vehicles.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Book Fair opened on Wednesday, attracting scores of visitors and book lovers to the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Abby Johnson, who teaches at TWGHs Tsoi Wing Sing Primary School, said she was hoping to buy authentic literature books for her students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secretly, I'm hoping to find some books for myself too as well later on," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student Jaccari said the fair offers better prices than book stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Book Fair usually secures a better deal, compared to maybe walking around in book stores, especially the chained ones which are more expensive," Jaccari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raistlin Lau, under secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, emphasised the importance of the fair in an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The publishing and printing industry is one of Hong Kong's important creative industries, and the Book Fair is an essential part of promoting industrial development," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as single-entry tickets which cost HK$30 for adults and HK$10 for children, visitors to the fair can also buy a super pass for HK$88 to enjoy unlimited entry to the week-long event, which ends on Tuesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Wednesday said Hong Kong should make good use of its common law jurisdiction, particularly when it comes to taking advantage of the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam participated in the 16th antechamber meeting, which focused on the Belt and Road Initiative. This monthly informal gathering brings together government officials and lawmakers from the Legislative Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Lam said Hong Kong needs to leverage its strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The central people's government takes the view that Hong Kong in future should focus on firstly enhancing Hong Kong's role as a platform for providing professional services, including, for example, to serve as an international legal service centre,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And secondly, to promote financial services and to enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre in particular in the area of green finance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same occasion, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said authorities were actively working towards strengthening cooperation with Belt and Road countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the Belt and Road Office is organising all these activities in coordination with the central government for organising visits to the Belt and Road countries, checking the enterprises and the professional services, going abroad and meeting different sectors so as to promote Hong Kong and our advantages,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau noted the government was also working towards joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a wide-ranging free trade agreement.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC announced that Georges Elhedery will become the new group CEO. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761942_1_20240717132925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC on Wednesday named chief financial officer Georges Elhedery as the bank's next chief executive to drive "the next phase of development and growth".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to confirm Georges as the next HSBC Group Chief Executive," group chairman Mark Tucker said in a filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board concluded that Georges was the outstanding candidate and we look forward to working together as he leads HSBC through the next phase of development and growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery will take over on September 2 from current CEO Noel Quinn, who announced his retirement in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery joined HSBC in 2005 and previously held the role of Co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets before being appointed chief financial officer in January 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanon-born, French-educated banker also led the bank's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkey region from July 2016 to February 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before assuming the role of CFO in 2023, Elhedery had a six-month sabbatical that included spending time learning Mandarin, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery has a "track record of leading through change, driving growth, delivering simplification, containing costs and brings a strong focus on execution," Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery said he was "deeply honoured" by HSBC's trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory," he said in the filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC said it would announce the next chief financial officer in due course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn would work with Elhedery to ensure a "smooth and orderly" handover before stepping down, the bank added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn, 62, oversaw a transformation of the London-headquartered lender and saw record profits during almost five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under him, the bank accelerated a years-long pivot to Asia -- where it generates most of its revenue -- vowing to develop its wealth business and target fast-growing markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank concluded the sales of its Canadian operations and its retail bank operations in France. It will also sell its Argentina division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn last year led the effort to repel a bid by major shareholder Ping An to spin off its Asia assets, with the proposal eventually voted down by shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The break-up bid highlighted HSBC's precarious position amid US-China tensions, with some observers questioning whether Europe's largest lender can continue to straddle East and West. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi on Wednesday said the new citizenship and social development (C&S) subject that replaced liberal studies in this year's Diploma of Secondary Education exams didn't make it any easier for students to achieve better scores overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some 94 percent of all candidates passed the new subject, which has either a pass or fail result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the C&S subject, I think we have a standard criteria and reference for assessment. So the result doesn't mean it's easier than before and it is not comparable because it is a newly adapted curriculum,” she told reporters after giving a speech to students at a school in Fo Tan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So I think we appreciate very much the effort from teachers and also from the students that they achieved their good scores.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she is pleased to see that students’ performance across all core and elective subjects improved overall, compared to last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 17,600, or 43 percent of daytime secondary school pupils got the grades needed for a publicly-funded university place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Ariel Lau, from Jockey Club Ti-I College, said she wants to study English at either Chinese University or City University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was out of my expectations to pass all my core subjects. I had so much anxiety. I couldn't sleep last night and it was very troubling for me. I'm very conflicted right now on what to choose because before I thought I might have to take the associate degree. But now that I've got 5** in English, I think I might have the upper hand in choosing between the two programmes,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students with physical disabilities also accomplished great results. One pupil with cerebral palsy at Hong Kong Red Cross Princess Alexandra School got a 5** in business, accounting and financial studies. He said his biggest obstacle to studying was not being able to move around easily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I can't sit for a long period of time, or else my legs will feel tense. My writing speed is also a bit slower than a normal person. I need to stretch and relax my muscles frequently during my studies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, 10 students from eight schools achieved top marks across six subjects, up from four last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the top scorers came from La Salle College. One said he is going to Imperial College London to study economics, finance and data science, while another said he plans to stay in Hong Kong and study at Chinese University's medical school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe it's because a family member of mine became sick when I was young. I think a doctor doesn't just provide good treatment for patients but also provides mental support. Now that I have this chance, I would also like to provide mental support for my future patients," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the top scorers came from St. Paul's Co-educational College. One plans to study medicine in the SAR and the other economics in the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It means a lot to me because I grew up in a grassroot family. I know the struggles, I know what it feels like to struggle about your daily necessities… and by studying economics, I learn about government policies, social welfare and I can utilise my knowledge to say, not necessarily assisting the government, but maybe reflecting the needs of minorities to the government,” the second student said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong Chinese Women's Club College produced a top scorer for the first time ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very excited! Looking at the past records, more top scorers came from elite schools. I never expected myself to be one of them. I am really thankful to every teacher in the school. I hope I can encourage other students to fight hard for their dreams," the student said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other top students came from St. Joseph's College, King's College, Ying Wa Girls' School, Diocesan Boys' School and Pui Ching Middle School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, around 49,000 students received their DSE results on Wednesday.

 Hong Kong passport holders can now stay in Thailand visa-free for a maximum of 60 days, up from 30, the Immigration Department announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A department spokesperson said in a statement that the two places have a close relationship in people-to-people and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the Belt and Road Initiative, this extension of the period of visa-free entry will bring greater travel convenience to holders of HKSAR passports and strengthen the tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, 172 countries and territories have granted visa-free access, or provide visa-on-arrival services, to Hong Kong passport holders.

    Fish-allergic children may eat some fish: CUHK study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Chinese University on Tuesday said they have developed a ladder system to help children with fish allergies reintroduce the food into their diet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The researchers said that between 2016 and 2021, they studied 249 children with fish allergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were found to be allergic to the protein β-parvalbumin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said some types of dark fish, such as salmon and tuna, have lower levels of the protein in them compared to fresh fish, such as tilapia and catfish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the researchers, Agnes Leung, said she hopes the ladder system can help children with allergies eat some kinds of fish, because the food has nutrients that can't be found elsewhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fish has very unique nutritional properties, for example, Omega 3 fatty acids are unique to fish, they help a growing child's brain development," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said they found that around 30 percent of the children in the study were not allergic to shellfish, such as shrimp and crab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major allergen in fish is parvalbumin, but the major allergen in shellfish is tropomyosin, so they are fundamentally different," Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For a lot of fish-allergic patients, they could in fact tolerate shellfish without developing allergic reactions."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty Hong Kong secondary school students will attend a young astronaut training camp on the mainland later this month, to get a taste of the country's space programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their nine-day trip includes stops in Beijing, as well as space facilities in Jiuquan, Gansu province, and Wenchang in Hainan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Space Museum said it's the first time the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre will open to a Hong Kong delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students will get to put on spacesuits, make and fly rocket models and may get to meet real-life astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the students were picked from a pool of 200 applicants, who were nominated by their schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Form two student Law Shun-yan is among those heading to the mainland and said he's very interested in the country's space development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud of China's space development. I want to become a space scientist or even an astronaut," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope to share what I experience in Jiuquan and Wenchang with others in Hong Kong, so that they get to know more about space, so we can study in this field together in future and contribute to our motherland's aerospace industry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony before the students headed off, Chief Secretary Eric Chan described the students as new blood for the SAR's integration into the country's development plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an international innovation and technological centre, Hong Kong surely has its responsibility to contribute what we can to the country's space missions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan thanked mainland authorities and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the camp, for their support.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) says companies in the SAR should look for investment opportunities in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edmund Lo, an economist at HKTDC, on Tuesday said investors should look out for green investments in Vietnam as this aligns with national policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another economist at the council, Henry Cheung, said Laos is looking for infrastructure investments to develop logistics, while Cambodia has several focuses ranging from digital infrastructure to being a logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irina Fan, director of research at HKTDC, said investors should look at both demand and national policies when determining business trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most important thing is to look for trade activities because when the trade activity moves up to a certain level, it will trigger investment activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) would also like to diversify from what they are doing, so this is a time where they would need investment support, they would need solution support."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nongfu Spring lashed out at the Consumer Council on Tuesday, accusing the watchdog of affecting its reputation by making what is said were biased comments towards its water content.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company demanded an apology and clarification from the watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council was following up on a lawyer's letter issued by Nongfu Spring, a day after the watchdog revealed its test results on 30 bottled water brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring said the watchdog wrongly categorised its product, applied an incorrect testing standard, and claimed the findings were misleading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also claimed the council's findings caused panic among Hong Kong and mainland consumers, and had caused "massive" damage to its brand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring stressed it would take further action unless the watchdog apologised and clarified its test results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council confirmed it had received a letter issued by Nongfu Spring's lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It maintained its analysis showed all samples of bottled water it tested were safe to drink.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761823_1_20240716172412.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten students have achieved perfect scores in this year's university entrance exams, up from four last year, while an overwhelming majority of Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam candidates passed the new citizenship and social development subject.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority on Tuesday said eight male and two female pupils got a perfect 5** across six subjects and earned "attained" in the new citizenship subject that replaced liberal studies, with eight of them also acing an extended mathematics module.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top scorers are among more than 49,000 DSE exam candidates who will receive their results on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 17,600 daytime secondary school pupils, or roughly 43 percent, met the minimum requirement needed for a publicly-funded university place, known as "332A22".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means scoring at least level 3 in both Chinese and English, level 2 in maths, and “attained” in the citizenship and social development subject, as well as level 2 in two electives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said 94.1 percent of candidates sitting the new subject achieved an "attained" level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wei Xiangdong, the authority's secretary general, said the introduction of the subject, graded with “attained” or “unattained”, was not a factor when it came to the increase in top-performing students this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it makes it easier to gain so many 5**, because all the other subjects, their assessment criteria did not change, and we used standard referencing every year. It should be equally difficult or easy to get 5** in other subjects," Wei said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricardo Mak, the director of public examinations, stressed that a number of overseas institutions recognise the new subject, including world-renowned universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Cambridge University, Simon Fraser University in Canada and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore also require students to have the ‘attained’ level in this subject to be admitted to their academic programmes,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exams authority also said it’s highly concerned that question-and-answer booklet content had been uploaded to social media platform Xiaohongshu, a move which resulted in a woman’s arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But officials said the incident did not affect the confidentiality of the exam questions, as such content was posted online after the tests had taken place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exams body added there are no plans right now to significantly expand the number of testing sites across the border after holding the exams at two centres in the Greater Bay Area this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly six percent of Hongkongers suffer from iron deficiency, according to a Department of Health study.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the department said it arrived at the figure after research involving 2,000 people aged between 15 and 84.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that iron deficiency, which can cause tiredness among other things, is more prevalent among girls and women, with 17.5 percent of those between 15 and 49 suffering from the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[With] regular menstruation there is blood loss, with blood loss there is iron loss, therefore women of reproductive age have higher iron requirements and are more prone to iron deficiency,” said Dr Rita Ho, head of the department's non-communicable disease branch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said 10.6 percent of females aged 15 to 49 have the more serious problem of iron deficiency anaemia, which can cause further health issues including fatigue and shortness of breath. Only 0.3 percent of males have the condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These figures are similar to those in other high income places, such as Canada and the United States, the department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said people can increase their iron intake by eating fish, eggs and beans, as well as up to 500 grammes of red meat per week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the department advised against iron supplements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is enough iron absorption [from meals] and the iron supplement is not necessary. There is too much iron in the supplements, there may be gastrointestinal side symptoms such as constipation,” Ho said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB called for better road maintenance in Central and Western District to address concerns regarding uneven roads, cracked pavements, and loose and sunken paving bricks which affects the safety of pedestrians and vehicles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The DAB recently inspected roads in the district and identified more than 200 spots with poor pedestrian or traffic conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said repairs in the past were fixed with poor quality paving material because it was quick and convenient. However, many repairs were damaged over time due to tree root growth, vehicles driving, and heavy trucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have continuously reported to the Highways Department to do emergency repairs, however, the material they are using is not durable...it may only last a few days after they do repair work," said District Councillor Rex Ip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legislative Councillor Chan Hok-fung called for a re-evaluation of the quality of asphalt used for emergency repairs and the strengthening of inspections so that work could happen as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip said while bigger repairs may come with disruptions, they were necessary to ensure the durability and longevity of new roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It may take over a month to do the whole repair work [for Caine Road]. If we could show the public that after the complete maintenance work is done, it may last for a few years, even though it may cause a bit of inconvenience.”

    HK swimming body to share review findings on rules

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's swimming governing body will announce the findings of a review of its rules within this year after a recent controversy on competition qualifications, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong China Swimming Association came under fire after initially barring a nine-year-old swimmer from competing due to his club's low ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The young swimmer is now allowed to join the championships in an individual capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said sports associations should take a pragmatic approach in reviewing their rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On resource allocation and organisation of competitions, each association is required to draw up their own rules. We also believe that this is the right approach," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if problems are identified, then a pragmatic approach should be taken in resolving these issues. Discussions are necessary to consider all options on enhancing the mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that the swimming body, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China and other representatives will have a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he will lead a delegation to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia later this month to explore business opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The delegation will include professionals from the trade, legal, commerce, logistics and innovation sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Asean is Hong Kong's second largest trade partner and a huge emerging market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We attach importance to our cooperation with these countries... I will talk to the business sectors and the political circles about what Hong Kong can bring to them, opportunities in various areas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to get their support for Hong Kong to join RCEP [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership] so that Hong Kong can be a super connector and super value adder."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lee announced the start of a public consultation exercise for his next policy address, adding that his team will attend more than 40 sessions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the sessions will focus on improving the economy and people's livelihoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is an open economy. We are affected by external uncertainties, say for example geopolitical tension, high interest rates, as well as challenges from different fronts. So we need to maximise our possibilities and opportunities," he said.

    'Consider inflation when setting public housing rents'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Winnie Ho says the authorities should not casually make changes to the way public housing rent increases are worked out." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761682_1_20240715175648.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday called on the government to take into account inflation and the cost of living when reviewing public housing rents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The calls came after the Housing Authority proposed raising rents by 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved, the increases would take effect in October with a three-month exemption period for most tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Edward Lau said the government should consider how much rent tenants can afford, as the city's economic recovery after the pandemic has been sluggish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Yang Wing-kit said the exemption period suggests a need to revamp the way rent increases are decided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Out of the past eight inspections, including this one, there have been four times when the Housing Authority provided some form of exemption or deferment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the entire mechanism is working well, you wouldn't need to specifically provide exemptions or delay payments. At this point, I think we need to consider whether the mechanisms in the current regulations require a review or optimisation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the authorities should not casually make changes to the way public housing rent increases are worked out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is one thing needed to be very cautious about inflationary factors. Because when we incorporate them, we should consider the actual affordability of each tenant. Inflation goes hand in hand with deflation," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, in a deflationary period, the reduction in wages may be less than the decrease in prices. This could result in a situation where you have to reduce wages and increase rent. These are sensitive situations, and we should not make changes to our mechanisms casually."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent.

    Girl whose heart stopped had no underlying illness: HA

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Monday said that a girl who suffered a cardiac arrest while getting stitches at a hospital didn’t have any underlying illnesses, after tests on her were negative.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Sum-yuet, who’s now five, went to Yan Chai Hospital in late May to treat a head wound, but while getting stitches, her heart stopped beating for nearly 20 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She remains in critical condition in intensive care at Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her father had accused medical staff of pushing her head down on a pillow during the procedure, something that was denied by the HA, which said her head was tilted sideways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After meeting with the girl’s family, the HA’s chief executive, Tony Ko, again apologised over the matter, saying the gesture was needed since the “unfortunate incident” took place at a public hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he wouldn’t say whether human error was involved, citing an ongoing criminal investigation by the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko stressed he wouldn’t go into details over exactly what went wrong, but an expert review of child care guidelines recommended checking patient vitals and consider using sedatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, when doing such procedures, [the expert panel recommended] how to better communicate with the patients and the relatives, how to closely monitor the patients, as well as in suitable cases when we need to introduce procedural sedation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[The panel is] not investigating the case, so mainly the purpose is to review our present guidelines to see which are the areas that we need to further emphasise and remind our colleagues to pay particular attention.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HA chief admitted the guidelines wouldn’t clearly list out all scenarios, such as whether sedation was needed in each case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko said officials discussed with frontline staff on ways to raise the overall safety of child patients, and the recommendations would be passed on to staff again later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said two medical staff involved in the girl’s treatment were transferred to non-clinical positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko said officials would do their best to provide medical care to the girl as well as give necessary support to her family.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Terminal Expo will be held in Hong Kong this November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The expo will feature conferences, awards and forums centred on celebrating and introducing aviation technology advancements, as well as facilitating discussions about urban air mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Duck, executive vice president of Informa Market, said multiple sectors, from banking to restaurants, stand to benefit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong has been chosen for the expo because it is right at the centre as the biggest growth area for aviation in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This (expo) is very important to show to everyone within the region that the place to meet the most amount of people in the shortest amount of time, is here in Hong Kong," Duck said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vivian Cheung, acting chief executive of the Airport Authority, said Chek Lap Kok has already made good use of new technology, from the third runway and facial recognition for passengers, to automated vehicles to carry luggage.

    'Housing estates to be more accessible for elderly'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Monday spoke at the Accessible for All @ Hong Kong Symposium about making residential areas more accessible for the elderly and disabled people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About a third of Hong Kong's population will be 65 or above in around 20 years from now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elderly citizens living in older estates may not have as many aids, such as handlebars, that help them move around easily. Ho spoke about plans to install handles and assistance bars in commonly frequented areas at housing estates such as bathrooms, by the elevators, and in hallways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In our residential estate design, accessibility is of the utmost importance...it is very important for us to make it convenient for [the elderly] to be mobile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho mentioned other ideas to make areas around residences more accessible, citing hopes to build more bridges and lifts to accommodate those who live in hilly parts of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linda Lam, chairperson of the Equal Opportunities Commission, stressed the importance of creating a universally accessible society, especially as Hong Kong's population ages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accessible, barrier-free environments and facilities are the prerequisites for people with disabilities to participate equally in society," said Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As our population ages, the demand for such facilities becomes increasingly urgent."

    Beware of suspicious pop-up alerts: police

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beware of suspicious pop-up alerts: police" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761644_1_20240715141143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday warned people to watch out for suspicious pop-up alerts on their computers, to avoid falling prey to "technical support" scams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said 12 cases were recorded in the past two months, with total losses amounting to more than HK$17 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said scammers send false system alerts to computers and pretend to be law enforcement agencies, before asking victims to call technical support and transfer money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Superintendent Baron Chan from the force's cyber security and technology crime bureau said victims are usually foreigners and English speakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Nowadays, the operation systems that we are using in most of our computers are Western-based. The language we use is mostly English, so that's why the scammers purport the scam alerts, they are mostly using English,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 70-year-old retiree, who gave her name as May, said she lost around HK$10 million to fraudsters who posed as police officers and technical personnel at Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The alert seemed urgent and official and being accompanied by ongoing loud noise and flashing colours on the screen. It was a relief to be offered a solution to a computer security threat, so I called the number,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan advised people to install antivirus software and avoid calling any technical hotlines, adding that the force is taking steps to block such pop-up advertisements.

    Watchdog recommends boiled tap water over bottled ones

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday advised people to opt for boiled tap water instead of bottled water.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During hot summer days, people tend to lose water more easily, and staying hydrated becomes crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consumer watchdog tested 30 bottled water brands, including mineral water and distilled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The findings revealed that tap water contained a higher mineral content than mineralised purified water and distilled water with added minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also discovered that the price of tap water was around 2,700 times lower than that of bottled water, as a litre of tap water costs around $0.00262 while distilled and purified drinking water costs HK$7.02 per litre on average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said tap water is a more eco-friendly and affordable option for consumers, compared to bottled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously our tap water, after you boiled it, it is much more economical, much more friendly, especially from an environmental protection point of view. Every bottle when you produce, you know, you're polluting the environment. Every bottle that you consumed, you are creating harm to the current environment as well as the next generation,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that all bottled water it tested passed its safety tests.

    Indoor playhouses urged to ensure facilities are safe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Consumer Council says indoor playhouse operators should ensure their terms and conditions are clearly stated. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761629_1_20240715115159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The consumer watchdog on Monday called on indoor playhouse operators to ensure the design and layout of their facilities are safe, and to clearly list out terms and conditions to avoid disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council said it had received a complaint about a child suffering a forearm dislocation and a wrist fracture from a fall while navigating a rope tunnel at a playhouse, and that a request for a refund and compensation was initially met with "ambiguous responses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The venue involved only proposed compensation of HK$3,000 after the watchdog stepped in, but the child's parent had yet to accept the offer and was considering legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The council would like to remind the industry that indoor playhouses must follow stringent safety standards in terms of game design and venue layout. They should also properly assess and mitigate any safety risks and provide sufficient safety measures to participants to ensure a positive experience for both parents and children," the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complaints included a toddler playgroup centre providing unclear terms and conditions to use complimentary playtime offered alongside a course enrolment, and another members-only indoor playhouse resetting a customer's account balance to zero without prior notice upon the expiry of the one-year membership period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The terms and conditions of use should be clearly stated, and flexible pricing policies are recommended to manage expectations and minimise disputes between traders and users," the watchdog said.

    Police meet with retail trade to address theft
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police meet with retail trade to address theft" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761617_1_20240715115137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they recently met with some 40 retail industry representatives to work on ways to prevent theft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the force recorded around 37,000 cases of theft between January and May this year, which represented a three percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them, there were 3,678 cases of shoplifting, a 12 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities arrested 1,750 people in total, of which around 150 of them were caught on suspicion of making repeated attempts at shoplifting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was suspected to have shoplifted five times during the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most common age group to commit shoplifting were those between 41 and 50 years of age, followed by those aged between 51 and 60 years. Police said there was no distinction between gender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mong Kok, Tsuen Wan and Tseung Kwan O were the areas that recorded the largest numbers of shoplifting cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Common shoplifted items included pharmaceutical products, shampoo and razors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine and chocolate were the main targets from November to January each year, while fruit and ice cream were most popular during summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largest case involved two bottles of wine priced at around HK$130,000. The force said there was no fixed price range of stolen products, as shoplifters mainly act out of a sudden urge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They don't steal the items for the values of them. They don't need the items, they don't need the money," police clinical psychologist Michael Fung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In one study, more than 48 percent of them committed shoplifting because of their personal loss, psychological loss in recent times. It could be losing their spouse, their loved ones, their job, or mobility or health. That somehow triggered their depression or negative feelings, negative mood, [and] they need to find a way to cope with that.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police have offered security suggestions for the retail sector, such as allocating more staff to assist customers, arranging for security guards in plain-clothes to patrol shop floors, and upgrading surveillance cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police noted that shoplifters look the same as ordinary customers, but there are a few ways to identify potential thieves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, [shoplifters] wear extraordinarily big clothing during very hot seasons, as it is easy for them to put stolen property into their clothes and just walk out, or bringing extraordinarily big bags that are empty at first... these might be hints they want to do something,” chief inspector Kelly Choi, who works on crime prevention, said.

    HKUMed adopts generative AI literacy into curriculum

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The HKU faculty of medicine will offer a generative AI literary series as a course to facilitate and enhance teaching and learning, through various multimedia methods.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department has developed a simulation education system called KASES to imitate real-life patient scenarios and an app that helps classify X-rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regardless of their disciplines or year of study, students can use these virtual systems with information compiled and validated by professors to practice the process of clinical reasoning and history taking. This particularly benefits first-year medical students who are not yet able to attend clinicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical Associate Professor and Director of Educational Technology Dr Gary Lau explained the need for AI literacy in the medical field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our future healthcare professionals must understand not only the potentials of generative AI but also the ethical issues, potential legal aspects, and professional considerations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While AI offers new opportunities for learning, Lau stressed the importance of not becoming over dependent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Teaching can not be purely replaced by AI. It will enhance our teaching, but the interaction of our students with real life patients is highly invaluable and cannot be replaced."

    'Treat DSE results day as a learning opportunity'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Students will be receiving their DSE results on July 17. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761605_1_20240715100208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A clinical psychologist said students who do not receive an ideal grade on their DSE exams should not feel discouraged, and instead treat the experience as a learning opportunity to build resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Students will be receiving their results on Wednesday and Dr Martina Cheung, from Castle Peak Hospital, said results day is a chance for students to build stress-coping techniques in the face of a challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that students can use the "MANGO" technique to train their psychological muscle in accepting undesirable results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said the M stands for meaning and purpose in which students can treat the experience as a learning opportunity, while A, for acceptance, encourages students to accept the results rather than to question it. She said the N for nurture pushes students to take care of their bodies and practise mindfulness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "G is for gratitude and generosity because some research show that if a person can have gratitude, it's better for their mood so they can think about what they can feel grateful, and also it's important to be generous to others because by helping others, one can focus on others rather than themselves. The research shows that it can reduce the anxiety and also the depressive symptoms," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last one is optimism. By having some positive visualisation of the future, it can improve the mood of the students and also when a person has better mood, they can have broader perspective and also can have better creativity to think about how to solve the problems."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung stressed that parents should ask how their child would like to be supported during these times, and give them the space and freedom to process the results.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun is looking to take part in his second Olympics next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clinched gold in men's single sculls in the lightweight category of the World Rowing Cup in May, which involved athletes weighing no more than 72.5 kilogrammes. Now, he's taking on a whole new challenge by participating in the open category in the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu told RTHK he's adopting a new strategy that he believes will better prepare him against the "real giants".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Ryan Leung is the first person from the SAR to successfully swim across the North Channel, between Ireland and Scotland, one of the marathon swimming challenges of the Oceans Seven.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 35-year-old swam 40 kilometres in 14 hours and 5 minutes with the swim ratified by the Irish Long Distance Swimming Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an Instagram post, the swimmer said he spent more than three hours on the last seven kilometres due to the current.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also wrote: "not fast but once again my fat is proven life-saving – average water temperature is 12.7 degrees Celsius, but I am sure most of it was 11 degrees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who used the challenge to raise funds for charities supporting grassroots youth development, thanked his fans for all their support.

    Hydrogen bus makes maiden cross-harbour trip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A double-decker hydrogen bus made its maiden cross harbour journey on Sunday, with route 170 passing through three toll tunnels, including Aberdeen Tunnel, Cross Harbour Tunnel and Lion Rock Tunnel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Richard Hall, the managing director of Citybus, said the company aims to phase out diesel buses in the next few years with plans of operating a full fleet of zero-emission buses by 2045. He said the company plans to purchase a large number of electric buses and bring in at least five hydrogen buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By running those vehicles in parallel, we have a greater volume. We will be able to get more data that will enable our future design and purchasing decisions. In terms of fares, fares have to rise on an ongoing basis. Fares are critical to supporting the sustainability of our operations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fares ensure that our employees, citizens of Hong Kong... can meet their cost of living and continue to keep pace with inflation. Fare increases also allows us to invest in new technology, improving our bus operations and delivering a great solution to all the citizens of Hong Kong that they can be proud of."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hall said their fleet composition in the future will compose of 70 percent hydrogen buses and 30 percent electric buses. He also said that Hong Kong would be put at the forefront of international and technological development for new energy solutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people were already queuing at Wah Fu Bus Terminus at around 6am to board the first scheduled bus of the day. A man surnamed Wong said he is worried about travelling through tunnels in a hydrogen bus given that it is flammable, but he said he believes the company had undergone many tests before its release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Diesel buses run on diesel so it releases a lot of exhaust smoke, and the bus is pretty loud when it is running. The hydrogen bus is a lot quieter and you can only hear the sound of the air conditioning. It is quiet inside and out," said another passenger surnamed Yau.

 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Sunday said the government has received an overwhelming response for the light public housing programme, receiving nearly 10,000 applications for flats under the project.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The housing minister noted that the administration received over 9,600 applications for the first batch of some 4,400 units located in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok, which will be ready early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants for these units must have been on the waiting list for conventional public housing for at least three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on a social media post, Ho urged eligible people to submit their applications regardless, saying that even if they do not get a unit this time, they will be prioritised in future rounds of applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also mentioned that she had visited the community in Tsuen Wan on Saturday to explain details of the programme to those who are interested, and reassured them not to worry about adjusting to a new living environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have visited people who only ever lived in the urban area and had never lived in the New Territories. They initially moved to Yuen Long with great trepidation. However, within a week or two, they found that adapting was surprisingly easy,” she wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The priority application period for the scheme closes on Monday.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says the administration will provide 96 extra foster beds during a 18-month period to temporarily accommodate about 300 abused children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761525_1_20240714170919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Sunday said it is reasonable for a newly passed law to make reporting of child abuse mandatory to come into effect 18 months after it is gazetted.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Sun said given the complexity and scale of the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill – which requires certain professionals to report to the authorities when they suspect serious child abuse cases – a year and a half is a reasonable timeframe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand that this involves 25 different professions and there are over 100,000 people involved. There’s a lot to work on,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what needs to be done? First, we need to create detailed guidelines. We need to train these 100,000 people and make sure they understand. On the other hand, we need to prepare for the aftermath. We expect an increase in reported cases, so that we need to have enough staff, facilities, and emergency resources. Everything needs to be in place before we can proceed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added the administration will provide 96 extra foster beds during the 18-month period, which will be used to temporarily accommodate about 300 abused children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding the Social Workers Registration Board, which saw seven of eight elected members of the current term resign, Sun said he is confident that other social workers would be willing to join the board when the next election takes place at the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the TVB interview, the minister also said he did not think it was too harsh to permanently revoke the licences of social workers who have been convicted of national security offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that it does not mean the administration is not giving a second chance to social workers who have committed other crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our judgement is the mainstream view of the society and the Legislative Council, is that social workers who have committed crimes against national security are out of the question. This is a lifetime suspension arrangement. But for social workers who have committed other crimes, I want to be very clear, we are very tolerant, as long as the circumstances allow and everyone thinks it's appropriate, they can still be social workers."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that public secondary school exam results due this Wednesday should not define the future of candidates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said regardless of the results, young people can find and develop their own future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology and innovation nowadays are rebuilding different industries around the world, as well as our lifestyles," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So long as young people embrace changes, dare to imagine and keep learning, and are determined to move forward, they can surely break new ground and develop their own future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that there are ups and downs in life, and people should persevere through success and failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that the government has been promoting development in innovation and a diverse economy, with the hopes of providing more quality jobs for young people, while enhancing the economy's development, momentum and resilience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil service minister Ingrid Yeung, for her part, said public exam results are not everything in life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said for those who intend to serve the public, they can try to learn more about jobs that the government offers as early as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can be a step quicker than others and plan your career, equip yourself for the future," she wrote on social media.

    Taxi fare hikes come into force

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New taxi fares went into effect on Sunday with the flagfall of red urban taxis increasing from HK$27 to HK$29, but some passengers say it is not the right time to raise prices, which also went up for green and blue taxis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For green New Territories taxis, flagfall went from HK$23.5 to HK$25.5, while the fares went up HK$2 for blue Lantau taxis to HK$24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After flagfall, the incremental charges for each 200 metres travelled under first-tier rates have also gone from HK$1.9 to HK$2.1 for urban taxis and from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9 for New Territories and Lantau taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-tier distance charges are up from HK$1.3 to HK$1.4 for urban and New Territories taxis, and from HK$1.5 to HK$1.6 for Lantau taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman surnamed Ko told RTHK that now is not the right time to be increasing fares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy isn't doing well right now, and suddenly they are increasing the fare by so much. The fares keep going higher and higher. Taxi drivers actually told me they don't want the fares to go up. They said if the fares go up, so does the rental costs for their vehicles so they don't really profit from this," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another woman, surnamed Cheung, said she does not mind the fare increase, but hopes that taxi services can improve. She said some cabs smelt of cigarette smoke and drivers had been rude to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Tong said people who take taxis frequently will not mind the fare increase, adding that he has had good experiences with taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a taxi driver surnamed Choi estimated that the fare increase could earn him HK$5 to HK$10 more for every HK$100. He said he does not think business will take a hit because of the fare hike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people rely on taxis like those who are in a hurry or people who are immobile. I don't think they will mind that extra dollar or two," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said on Sunday that officials will not set a cap for booking fees for future taxi fleets, which they hope will hit the streets by the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government is set to give out five licences for these fleets this month, which it hopes can provide high quality taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked whether passengers will find booking fees troublesome, the minister said people are familiar with online car-hailing services, and that booking charges will be something that will be left up to the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We won't be setting a maximum booking fee level. We believe the market will make adjustments. Of course, we hope that the fleets and the users will come up with their own reasonable amount in this regard," Lam said on a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed the taxi fleets must provide online car-hailing services, adding the Transport Department will be providing links on its website to their platforms and mobile apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said that taxi fleets will be given the freedom to design the looks and logos of their vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government – which will carry out a year-long study on passenger demand and how their needs are changing – plans to regulate online car-hailing services by issuing licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said the administration's study does not take the price of taxi licences into consideration, adding that officials have the overall public interest in mind, and stressed that the government wants to maintain a highly efficient public transport system.

    Doraemon fans flock to Tsim Sha Tsui exhibition

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of Doraemon flocked to Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday for an exhibition, in its returns to the city after 12 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The free-entry zone at the Avenue of Stars features the world's tallest 12-metre inflatable Doraemon sculpture as well as 34 different versions of Doraemon in 1:1 life size.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some fans chose to buy a ticket to access the indoor exhibition at K11 MUSEA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who came from Shenzhen, said he made a day trip to Hong Kong just for the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very excited and I'm looking forward to it. I've waited for this moment for over two months. I may come again next week for the drone show," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Doraemon fan said his family had moved to the United States, but they are back in town and felt lucky to catch the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are back in Hong Kong for the summer vacation. Tickets went on sale 2 months ago and we bought them immediately. We spent about HK$2,000 on souvenirs. We bought clothes, a popcorn bucket and a soft toy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition runs from Saturday to August 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers said tickets for the indoor exhibition are sold out.

    Watchdog mulls penalty to firms in data breaches

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Privacy commissioner Ada Chung says her office received nearly 100 data breach reports in the first half of 2024. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761441_1_20240713130652.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legal amendments to directly penalise firms involved in data breaches are being considered, privacy commissioner Ada Chung said on Saturday, which would change the current practice of issuing an enforcement notice with a non-compliance subject to a fine or imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Chung said there is a need to empower the watchdog to penalise firms breaching the privacy ordinance to increase deterrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we are to introduce a mechanism for administrative fines, we have to look at a series of factors and then decide on the penalty amount. For example, the number of people that were affected by the data breach, because affecting 10 people is completely different from affecting 100,000 people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also we have to look at the sensitivity of the data, whether it involves medical records, as well as how the data was leaked, whether it's the fault of the company or its staff, or simply an individual case.“
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said the privacy watchdog received 97 data leak reports in the first half of the year, with seventy percent of them coming from private firms and public bodies accounting for the rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of data breaches in the second quarter rose by 70 percent, she added.

    Travel alerts on HK not grounded in facts: Eric Chan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan has hit out at certain countries and regions deciding to issue travel alerts on Hong Kong, saying the warnings are simply not grounded in facts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taiwan recently upgraded the warning to its second highest after the United States renewed the SAR's emergency status, which were widely condemned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The senior official told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that the moves were politically motivated and the SAR must rebut the accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have one mega event almost every two days on average. We also have a lot of international events. The aim is to have overseas tourists come to Hong Kong and see if it's as others say it is, that police are arresting people arbitrarily on the streets after the introduction of the national security law," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's best for people to come and see for themselves, and they will see that the situation isn't what they think it is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary also said the administration will promote patriotic education through a "soft approach", and that people must first understand the nation before forming an identity and eventually loving and safeguarding the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that there will be activities across all 18 districts on October 1, combining National Day celebrations and patriotic education.

    'No sports system should obstruct an athlete'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sports chief Kevin Yeung says sports governing bodies should review their systems from time to time and strengthen their governance. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761433_1_20240713114753.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sports minister has stressed that no system should hinder an athlete's opportunity to compete or receive training, following calls for the swimming governing body to revise its rules of competition qualifications.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong China Swimming Association came under scrutiny after a nine-year-old was reportedly barred from competing at a swimming competition due to the ranking of his club, despite meeting the qualifying time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, on Saturday said the government awaits developments of the situation, after the association said it has ways to allow the concerned athlete to compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he told a Commercial Radio programme that different sports governing bodies should review their systems, from time to time and strengthen their governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope to promote the sport, as well as its development, while giving talented athletes the chance to receive professional training or compete, or even represent Hong Kong in competitions. This is a basic principle that I believe everyone agrees with, so no system should become a factor that hinders this goal," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrival of the two giant pandas gifted by the central government, the minister said the pair should be able to arrive in Hong Kong by National Day, on October 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the administration would discuss whether to give the pair new names when they arrive in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the government is considering promoting "giant panda economy" to boost tourism.

 The administration is aiming to have all government bureaus and departments adopt Hong Kong's own version of ChatGPT within this year, according to the technology chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Dong, the secretary for innovation, technology and industry, also said on Saturday that his bureau has been trialling the AI-powered document assistance system, which was developed by government-founded platform InnoHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The concept of the trial is that when we are using the system, problems will arise, and then we give feedback to improve it. At the same time, the more we use and train it, the better the model will be," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now, the trial has been smooth, and the system will soon be expanded to other bureaus for use. The goal is simple – to have the entire government using the system this year. And the system will eventually be open to the whole society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said the government has deliberated introducing the city's data security law, but noted that the process is rather complicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Legislation is definitely within our scope of consideration, but it cannot be done overnight," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that data security law will be introduced once the data industry has matured.

    AI robot helps patients with cognitive impairment

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761414_1_20240713081443.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eastern Hospital is testing an AI-powered robot to help training patients with mild cognitive impairment, with therapists describing that as "a helpful assistant".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hospital’s occupational therapists have compiled a database of about 400 questions, covering key cognitive domains and input it into the robot, which is able to communicate with people in Cantonese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During training sessions, the robot randomly posts questions from the database. Patients can answer by talking to the robot, and they must get each of the questions right before moving on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The robot will provide hints if patients struggle with a question repeatedly and adjust the difficulty level for subsequent questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will be a very good encouragement for the patients to continue their cognitive training. Because many of the patients, if they face several failures, they may just idle the training sections away,” says senior occupational therapist Thomas Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And this situation is very common when we use the traditional one-way computer-aided training. For AI, it can eliminate these kinds of limitations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These robot-assisted sessions are typically about 20 minutes shorter than traditional face-to-face sessions, and patients who improve quickly can even do the sessions without a therapist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Cheung stressed that while this helps free up some staff time, it doesn’t mean human therapists can be replaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can say this AI robot facilitates the patient's participation in training but I don't think AI robots will replace human therapists. For this AI robot it still has to depend on the input from the therapist in programming and provide different situations for this system to learn,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital currently deploys one AI-powered robot to work with a select group of geriatric and psychiatric patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it’s working on expanding the AI database and upgrading the hardware to improve the robot’s conversation skills and response time before wider use.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday led a number of senior officials to attend the Hong Kong-Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He told delegates with the SAR government enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law this year, Hong Kong could now focus on economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the areas of co-operation, the SAR government said it was studying with its Shenzhen counterparts on ways to build a clinical trial co-operative platform within the Lok Ma Chau Loop area, also known as the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it would set up a clinical trial institute in the Loop area by the end of this year, with the aim of providing trials for the entire Greater Bay Area population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said Hong Kong and its bay area counterparts would work to build an international medical innovation hub in the long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute was first mentioned in Chief Executive John Lee's policy address last year.

    'Harsher punishments over medical incidents needed'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical sector lawmaker on Friday called for harsher punishments for senior managers responsible for medical incidents at public hospitals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority set up a review committee earlier this month to look at the operations and incident response policies at public hospitals following a series of blunders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmaker David Lam, who is one of the committee members, said senior managers should be held accountable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If it's just about having senior management to come to meet with the press, bow their head, express their concern for the affected families, and deduct some bonus or welfare benefits to the staff concerned, that's not enough. We should not just shift the responsibility to frontline staff," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review committee will examine existing mechanisms to monitor performance and look at systems to manage risk and accountability, as well as incident response policies at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will submit its recommendations to the authority's governing board within three months.

    Tai Lam Tunnel toll plan sparks debate in legislature

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it has reservations about making the Tai Lam Tunnel free. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761327_1_20240712160232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Whether the Tai Lam Tunnel should be free at certain times was up for debate among lawmakers on Friday, with the government expressing reservations about the suggestion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Most legislators agreed, however, that the administration should charge time-varying tolls after it takes control of the New Territories tunnel next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature earlier, officials outlined three different pricing scenarios, including two fixed toll proposals and a third with different fares for peak, regular and off-peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed staggered tolls, private car drivers would pay HK$45, HK$35 or HK$20 depending on the time of day. Taxi drivers would pay HK$30 at all times, while commercial vehicles would be charged HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Chun-san, the undersecretary for transport and logistics, said the government has reservations about making the tunnel free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reduction is not acceptable for the point of view of the use of public money and traffic management. We have to make sure that the traffic is smooth, and to maintain the tunnel, we need to charge a toll," Liu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some lawmakers, including New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip, said they believe fees are necessary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to let people know the infrastructure is a massive public investment and we should make the best use and do not abuse any infrastructure. We have to let people know that resources are valuable. So I'm against an infrastructure service free of charge," Ip said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Edward Lau of the DAB said he would not support any of the three pricing scenarios put forward by the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the new tunnels... all of these are offered for use free of charge. Why do you adopt a different principle for the Tai Lam Tunnel?" Lau asked.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As part of the "100% Doraemon & Friends Tour (Hong Kong)", ticket holders can view an expansive indoors and outdoors exhibition at K11 Musea in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Those that do not have tickets can view a Doraemon exhibition at the Avenue of Stars for free, where there will be 34 1:1 life-sized sculptures of different versions of Doraemon along with 10 friends of the beloved blue cartoon character.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from the exhibitions, other activities include "The Doraemon Drone Show", which will return to Victoria Harbour on July 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on that day, "100% Friends-Calling Bell" themed trains will park at Sha Tin MTR Station and at the Light Rail's Siu Hong stop so fans can take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Kevin Yeung, said he believes this will be a good large-scale event for Hong Kong, adding that Doraemon is a cherished part of many Hongkongers' childhood memories.

    Govt urged to raise number of hire-car permits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers discussed a government proposal to regulate online car-hailing platforms. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761307_1_20240712125139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have urged the government to increase the number of permits for ride-hailing services, saying authorities have to ensure healthy competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of permits is currently capped at 1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting on Friday, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the threshold to apply for a permit is too stringent, and that online ride-hailing services are a rising trend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another legislator, Chan Pui-leung, said the government should not keep online car-hailing services “on a tight leash”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to uphold one principle – regulation is meant to promote healthy growth of the industry,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Chan Siu-hung, for his part, said regulating such platforms should come hand-in-hand with issuing more hire-car permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If [the administration] is just regulating the platforms without issuing licences, and if only taxis are able to provide personalised point-to-point business, then people would be discouraged from taking taxis because of their poor service quality,” the legislator said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we don’t have enough competition in the market, people and tourists will be the losers… We don’t want to have an impression that the government is tilting in favour of the taxi industry.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport chief Lam Sai-hung said the government's regulation plan does not favour the taxi trade, and the administration will “listen to opinions and look at data” when drawing up its legislative proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to ensure the safety of passengers and their rights, and also have to pay attention to the healthy development of the transport industry. I don’t think the two are mutually exclusive,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we want to see a healthy development of the industry, and given the two broad principles, we need to strike a balance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is planning to regulate online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate. Anyone found to be involved in providing illegal services could have their driving licence suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities will conduct a study to review passenger demand before presenting a legislative proposal next year.
