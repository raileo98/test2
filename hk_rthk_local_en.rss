<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a ruling by the Communications Authority that a satirical RTHK TV programme had breached broadcasting rules by insulting police officers and failing to ensure its content was accurate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Communications Authority had issued a warning to RTHK’s
  <i>
   Headliner
  </i>
  programme over an episode in 2020, which allegedly denigrated police by depicting an officer popping out of a rubbish bin, and for suggesting that the force was scrapping foot patrols amid the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal found that the authority, and a lower court, were wrong in ruling that
  <i>
   Headliner
  </i>
  -- which was taken off air four years ago -- was in breach of broadcast rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I accept that the Police was mocked and lampooned as worthless and unprofessional in the opening and closing sequences of the segment, and that this must be insulting and denigrating to them," wrote the High Court's vice president, Susan Kwan, in the judgment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, it is clear that when the opening and closing sequences are considered in the context of the entire segment, the mockery was directed towards the work of the Police in the fight against Covid-19."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added the authority, and a judge who partially supported their findings, had failed to take into account this broader context, and had misapplied the relevant code in finding that the programme had denigrated the police purely on the basis of social status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Appeals Court also said the lower court had made a “fundamental error” by failing to address the broadcaster’s contention that the comments in the programme regarding the police patrols were a satirical expression about public concerns, rather than a statement of fact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As such, the court ordered the relevant rulings to be quashed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separate appeals over the earlier rulings were lodged by the authority, the RTHK Programme Staff Union and the Journalists Association.

    Scores of imported workers being exploited: union

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A union on Wednesday urged the government to enhance monitoring of construction companies, saying it has received complaints about exploitation of imported workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the Construction Industry Employees General Union said it believes that more than 100 such workers are being exploited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said some have been told to work extra shifts for no pay, and to pay for training fees and the tools they use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union alleged that a company involved in the airport's third runway project told workers to hand over their ATM cards and confiscated more than half of their salaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union's rights and complaints officer, Ng Wai-leung, said the complaints are only the tip of the iceberg and it's likely that many abused workers are keeping silent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They don't want to be blacklisted by their company, making them not able to come to Hong Kong again. This is their main concern," Ng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that some workers have been sacked and sent out of Hong Kong after seeking help from the union.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Wednesday it would consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 between 6pm and 9pm as Typhoon Yagi continues to intensify and edge closer to the western part of the South China coast.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Standby Signal No. 1 is now in force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory also said it would assess the need to issue higher signals between Thursday afternoon and Thursday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of 9am, Yagi was estimated to be about 520 kilometres southeast of Hong Kong and local winds are expected to strengthen gradually on Wednesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory also recorded more than 9,000 lightning strikes from 10pm to midnight on Tuesday amid an Amber Rainstorm Warning signal.

 Police have arrested 217 men and 45 women in a seven-week-long anti-narcotics operation. The suspects, aged 15 to 72, were detained on suspicion of manufacturing, trafficking, and dealing in dangerous drugs, as well as possession.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the operation, codenamed Tailbacker, officers seized 695 kilos of suspected cocaine and 572 kilos of suspected marijuana with a total street value of HK$759 million. Police said most of the drugs were recovered from Kowloon East and Yuen Long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those arrested, 33 were aged 20 or below. More than half of them were arrested for trafficking in dangerous drugs. Police said one of the suspects, a 15-year-old boy, was found with 34 grams of suspected crack cocaine and 8.6 grams of suspected ketamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the operation, officers also seized a total of about 2.2 kilos of suspected etomidate, commonly known as "space oil".

  Wheelchair fencers kicked off their campaign in the French capital, but had relatively brief stints on the piste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six-time Paralympian Alison Yu earned a bye in the round of 32 as the 10th seed of the women's sabre category A.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The classification is for fencers with good sitting balance and impairments affecting their lower limbs.
  <br/>

   The 40-year-old made a winning start in the last 16, but was beaten 4-15 by Georgia's Nino Tibilashvili in the quarter-final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yu fell into the repechages, where she was eliminated by Gemma Collis of Great Britain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She admitted sabre wasn't her strong suit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My goal before the event was simply to win one match. I’ve achieved it by winning the first match," the seven-time gold medallist said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Later on, my swordsmanship was a bit lacking compared to other players. What's good about the day was that I could adapt to the venue and the cheers of the audience. I also saw many friends from Hong Kong in the crowd showing their support."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fan Pui-shan was also sent packing from the women's sabre, after being edged out by South Korea's Kwon Hyo-kyeong in the round of 32.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 49-year-old fencer lost 8-15 in category A.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For me, I treated the sabre competition as a warm-up match, because sabre fencing isn't my strong suit. I mainly enjoyed it and got the feel of things," she said.

    In category B for fencers with an impairment that impacts their sitting balance or fencing arm, Tong Nga-ting was unable to advance after she was beaten by her South Korean rival in the repechage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The SAR fencers now look ahead to the foil competitions.

     Natasha Tse was placed 15th out of 22 entrants in the grade one individual championship test.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Only the top eight riders progressed to the individual freestyle event.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Tse competed with her new horse, Juno's Whispering Angel.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The four-time Paralympian said she's still figuring out how to team up well with her new equine partner.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "We've worked together about a dozen times over the past few months. We're still getting the hang of things. Its performance is okay, but there's plenty of room for improvement. When I was preparing for the Paralympics, I hurt my waist, but I pushed through to finish the competition," Tse said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Wednesday morning said it may consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 later in the day. It had issued the Standby Signal No 1 at 5.40pm on Tuesday, as Severe Tropical Cyclone Yagi neared the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HKO added that the No 1 signal will remain in force until at least noon on Wednesday, with Yagi maintaining a distance of more than 400 kilometres from the SAR on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKO said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 later on Wednesday as the storm edges closer to the coast of southern China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the influence of Yagi, the weather over the coast of Guangdong will deteriorate in the latter part of this week. There will be heavy squally showers and seas will be rough with swells," the Observatory said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to take note of the latest weather forecast.

 A task force set up to look into a spat between top University of Hong Kong (HKU) officials has expressed hope that it could help the tertiary institution's operations return to normal, following a meeting with its governing council.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Investigation and Study Group on the Internal Operational Affairs of HKU said it's come up with a range of recommendations on the personnel arrangements for senior positions at the university, based on a number of guiding principles such as making the interest of the institution as the overriding priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also called on the university's higher-ups to cooperate and fill senior-level vacancies as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group held a meeting with council members including former lawmaker Abraham Shek and incumbent legislator Chan Chun-ying, where all recommendations put forward by the task force were accepted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This outcome is the result of more than two months of relentless efforts by the [investigation and study group], which can help the HKU resume normal operations as soon as possible in its fundamental interest," a statement released on Tuesday read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The task force – made up of Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li and University Grants Committee chief Tim Lui – also noted that the university had been conducting hiring exercises, with some relating to senior positions such as the provost, vice-presidents, the registrar and deans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [investigation and study group] urges the council and the management to work expeditiously on these searches with a view to filling such vacancies," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group was established in June this year amid an escalating conflict among the university's leadership. It said it’s held more than 60 meetings with parties, including the university's president and vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang, and council chairwoman Priscilla Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang had previously complained that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Wong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Association for the Physically Disabled of Hong Kong, China said on Tuesday that more promotion of para sports is needed to attract a new generation of para athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association’s chairman, John Leung, applauded the SAR delegation for their speculator performance in the Paris Paralympics. Team Hong Kong has won six medals so far, including two golds, three silvers and a bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong has produced many top-ranking para athletes, and he hopes more will continue to join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of our disabled students and the disabled youth are decreasing. And therefore, we have to work harder to attract more students from the special school, from the disabled school, to encourage them to participate more in the disabled sports," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We are] hoping [they will move up]… to the Tier B level, and eventually, they go to the elite."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung also said he hopes more resources can be allocated in this area, and that more people in Hong Kong will support and pay attention to para sports in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) on Tuesday issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 5.40pm, as Severe Tropical Cyclone Yagi neared the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HKO added that the No. 1 signal will remain in force until at least noon on Wednesday, with Yagi maintaining a distance of more than 400 kilometres from the SAR on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKO also said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 later on Wednesday as the storm edges closer to the coast of southern China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the influence of Yagi, the weather over the coast of Guangdong will deteriorate in the latter part of this week. There will be heavy squally showers and seas will be rough with swells," the Observatory said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to take note of the latest weather forecast.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A transformed museum documenting China's resistance against the Japanese invasion is set to open on Wednesday, with Chief Executive John Lee calling it "an important base" for patriotic education.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence was renamed the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence, focusing on the history of the War of Resistance and the city's military affairs, to cultivate a stronger sense of national esteem and patriotism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The name change was made on Victory Day of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the museum now combines the existing relics of coastal defence with exhibitions on the war, to allow visitors to experience "the resolute resistance" of the Chinese people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The history of the war against Japan reminded us to cherish the hard-fought peace. It is an important teaching material for young people to learn the deeds of the martyrs, and deepen their feeling for the nation and traditional cultural connotations," Lee said at an unveiling ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence will become one of the important bases for patriotic education."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revamped museum will see its first thematic exhibition, jointly presented by local and mainland authorities, highlighting the resistance activities of the East River Column in Shenzhen and Hong Kong during the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The museum's curator, Rebecca Cheung, said the exhibition is very important to "convey the idea of patriotism" and to understand the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The East River Column was not only a pillar of the resistance of southern China, but also made a significant contribution to the national victory in the war," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said people are encouraged to donate items and photos relating to the war to the museum for future exhibitions and research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be four exhibition galleries to showcase the history of the War of Resistance at the museum in Shau Kei Wan.

    Cathay's handling of engine glitch 'professional'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A flight engineering expert says the public should not worry about safety after the latest engine glitch at Cathay Pacific. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768907_1_20240903153255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A flight engineering expert said on Tuesday the public should not worry about aircraft safety, after Cathay Pacific grounded its A350 flights due to an engine glitch on Monday which forced its Zurich-bound aircraft to fly back to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The carrier said on Tuesday that ongoing maintenance work had identified 15 airplanes whose engine components had problems which require replacements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the affected planes were expected to be able to fly again on Saturday. Cathay has 48 A350 aircraft in its fleet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warren Chim, the deputy chair of the Institute of Engineers' aircraft division, told RTHK he doesn't think passengers have to worry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes the case required a "mandatory occurrence report", meaning it could lead to hazardous or potentially hazardous conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the engineer thinks Cathay's handling of the matter was professional.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As what we observed, everything after the incident happened in accordance with the established process and established procedures," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So as a passenger, I don't think we need to over-worry about that because all the processes and procedures are according to the international practice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chim stressed not only does Cathay need to report the case to local and European authorities, all engine parts will have to go through stringent tests before the planes can fly again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike Ng, an engineering lecturer with the Institute of Vocational Education, said there were around 600 A350 planes in operation around the world, and whether other airlines would be affected could depend on whether those engine parts came from the same batch as Cathay's faulty components.

    Patriotic education group rolls out a theme song

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's Working Group on Patriotic Education came out with a theme song on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Titled "Our Home", the song was sung by sub-group member Cally Kwong - a Cantopop singer who was active during the 1980s. She is also a local deputy to the National People's Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The city has been through a lot in the past years and I have always wanted to produce a song that could bring warmth to the people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong also shared her favourite verses by singing it out loud when meeting the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Convenor Starry Lee revealed that it took them around a year to work on the project after deciding to roll out a song for promoting patriotism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that using [music] is one of the most effective means to [generate enthusiasm] because we all know that, especially children, teenagers, they all love songs. Actually not only students, teenagers, different ages of people, different sectors of people, go to karaoke, or when attending functions, they will choose songs to express their feelings," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope this song will become very popular among different ages, different people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who's also the SAR's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said production costs were low, adding Kwong does not claim any copyright to the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pointed out that a USB-drive will be distributed to primary and secondary schools, so that they can sing the song during lesson time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also rolled out a karaoke version and has made a QR code available for the public to download it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee called on everyone to sing the song before and after National Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added many activities will be rolled out for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and details will be announced later.

 Cathay Pacific says inspections carried out following the inflight failure of an engine component on one of its A350s have found 15 aircraft in need of repairs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's flag carrier has cancelled dozens of flights since a glitch forced the return of a plane bound for Zurich on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maintenance activity on our A350 fleet is progressing well. Our engineering team have thoroughly inspected our fleet of operational A350 aircraft within 24 hours," Cathay said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In total, we have identified 15 aircraft with affected engine components that require replacement and three have already gone through successful repairs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The remaining 12 aircraft in need of replacement parts were expected to resume operations by Saturday, the airline said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it expected to cancel another 20 regional flights on Wednesday, but that no long-haul services would be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the remaining cancellations up to Saturday (7 September), we will provide further details by 2:00pm tomorrow [Wednesday]," the airline said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has launched a programme to make it easier for non-local professionals who have come to Hong Kong through talent schemes to join volunteer services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the launch ceremony on Tuesday, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the initiative aims to help new arrivals integrate into the local community and allow them to contribute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the platform in place, we expect more of the talents to join us, join hands with Hong Kong local people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So together, we believe they can contribute to our society as volunteers, and we also can benefit from their expertise and also their passion towards Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, Sun confirmed that he has received a proposed list of members for a disciplinary panel under the Social Workers Registration Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The confirmation came after local reports said social worker Jackie Chen, who is involved in a rioting court case, had been removed from the list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I, as the Secretary, am satisfied with the list, we're going to publish it in the Gazette. I can confirm we have received the recommended list from the board. So after vetting the list, we're going to publish the list in the Gazette as part of the legal requirement," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, the Legislative Council passed a bill to reform the board, raising the number of government-appointed members.

 The Observatory on Tuesday said it would issue the Standby Signal No. 1 this evening and there was a relatively high chance it would issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Forecasters said the number one signal was scheduled to be issued sometime between 5pm and 8pm on Tuesday, as Tropical Cyclone Yagi was expected to remain more than 600 kilometres away from Hong Kong and wasn't expected to directly affect the SAR yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With Yagi edging closer to the coast of southern China gradually, winds will strengthen over the region later this week. The chance for issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 is relatively high," the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it expected heavy squally showers and rough seas with swells, as the weather for coastal Guangdong was expected to worsen in the latter part of the week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday appealed for witnesses after a vehicle fell into the sea from Shenzhen Bay Bridge on Monday night; killing the driver, a 46-year-old customs officer. The incident happened at 9.18 pm on the bridge's northbound section.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, police said the car had reportedly gone out of control, rammed into an information road sign on the hard shoulder, then bounced over the barriers before plunging into the sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police officers and firemen sped to the scene and conducted search and rescue operation in the vicinity. The car was located at the bottom of the sea. The driver was trapped inside the compartment and later rescued by firemen. Sustaining multiple injuries, the man was rushed to Tin Shui Wai Hospital in an unconscious state and was certified dead at 1.30 am today," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer had been heading to work at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At an earlier press briefing, chief inspector Chui Wing-luen said the road was dry and there was no road maintenance work at the scene.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan has wrapped up his illustrious career by collecting a silver medal for Hong Kong, China at the Paralympic Games in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old veteran insisted he was proud of his performance, despite not being at his best on the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two came up short against Daiki Kajiwara, the top seed from Japan, losing 10-21, 10-21 in the men's singles WH2 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was still one step better than his bronze-medal finish in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, a tearful Chan revealed lower back pain hampered his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I really put in a lot of effort. Before the competition, my waist was so painful that I couldn't even turn around. I had to ask the therapist for help, and take medications," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to compete like a 20-year-old, but I haven't been able to do that in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stood by his decision to hang up his racquet, saying he wanted to have a good rest and recuperate from the "tormenting" chronic spasms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was heartbreak for fellow SAR shuttler Chu Man-kai, who missed out on a medal after losing to Brazil's Vitor Tavares 21-23, 21-16, 12-21 in the men's singles SH6 bronze medal match.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Customs officer has died after his vehicle fell into the sea from Shenzhen Bay Bridge on Monday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at about 9 pm on Monday of a traffic accident on the northbound route of the Shenzhen Bay Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, chief inspector Chui Wing-luen said the road was dry and there was no road maintenance work at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Officers found two skid marks on the fast lane of the road and a damaged road maintenance sign on the slow lane. There were also signs of impact on the railings. We believed the vehicle plunged off the bridge after the accident," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fire Services Department said the diving team took over two hours to locate the vehicle, and rescuers retrieved the driver's body from the car at around midnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An assistant divisional officer Yu Wai-wah said conditions weren't favourable for the search and rescue mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The water is shallow and the environment is dark. The visibility is very low underwater, which made the search more difficult," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the driver was sent to Tin Shui Wai Hospital where he was later certified dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said there were no surveillance cameras at the scene, but officers would inspect the vehicle and try and find out how fast it was travelling at the time of the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner of Customs and Excise Louise Ho expressed deep condolences over the passing of the officer, who died while heading to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the man was a senior customs officer stationed at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point.

 Third-time Paralympian Ho Yuen-kei clinched another gold medal for Hong Kong, China, at the South Paris Arena. She defeated her Australian opponent 4-2 in the boccia women's individual B-C-3 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ho said the gold medal belongs to everyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It’s for everyone who helped me...I hope our 23 athletes at the Paralympics in France show that we aren’t doing well just because we have disabilities and work hard. We want to send a message that we’re all the same and share the Hong Kong spirit of never giving up."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific said it has cancelled 48 flights after discovering an engine glitch in one of its A350 aircraft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's flag carrier said it identified an engine component failure in an A350 aircraft en route to Zurich on Monday. That forced the flight to return to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This component was the first of its type to suffer such failure on any A350 aircraft worldwide," Cathay said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier has since inspected all 48 of its A350 aircraft and found that some of the same components required replacement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said 48 flights operating through Tuesday were cancelled. Affected passengers have been informed and offered alternative travel arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Each aircraft is undergoing a rigorous inspection. Upon completion, the aircraft cleared for operation will return to service, while those identified with technical issues will undergo further repair and maintenance work," Cathay's engineering director Keith Brown said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, we are liaising with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department and the aircraft and engine manufacturers.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR boccia athlete Annie Cheung on Monday added a silver medal for Hong Kong, China in the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paralympic debutant, 25, was defeated by China's Lin Ximei 5-1 in the women's individual BC4 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin scored a point in each of the first two ends for a 2-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the third end, a series of miscues by Cheung widened the gap, with Lin scoring three more times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung picked up one point in the fourth and final end but it was not enough to overcome the deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's victory in the final avenged her loss to Cheung in their inaugural pool match in the preliminary round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not very satisfied with my overall performance, especially in the final. I was too nervous, so I wasn't playing as freely as I should. But I am still very happy to be able to win a silver medal," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I try to regroup as quickly as possible... and I hope to achieve good results in the mixed pairs event."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will compete in the boccia's mixed pairs event alongside six-time Paralympian Leung Yuk-wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Cheung on winning the silver medal, praising her for staying resilient against the world's best athletes throughout the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, SAR table tennis player Leung Chung-yan ended his Paralympic debut when he was beaten in the last 16 of the men's MS-11 singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost 6-11, 11-8, 6-11 and 6-11 to Peter Palos of Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team have now captured one gold, two silvers and a bronze at the Paris Paralympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR boccia player John Loung on Monday won Hong Kong's first gold medal in the Paris Paralympics, bowling his way to victory in the men's individual BC1 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Loung, who is competing in his fourth Paralympics, beat Jung Sung-joon of South Korea 4-1 to reach the top of the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete went ahead by scoring two points in end one, and then added a point in each of the next two ends, before Jung responded with a point in the final end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Loung cheered and waved to the crowd after his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on behalf of Loung after the match, his coach Marco Lau said the athlete did not think it was possible to reach the final, let alone win a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Loung also paid tribute to his coaches as well as veteran boccia star Leung Yuk-wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to our head coach, Kwok [Hart-wing], and other coaches who have helped me a lot. And also, thank you to Leung Yuk-wing, for assisting his teammates quite a bit in their training," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Loung on winning gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "John Loung demonstrated unwavering determination and superb skills in the competition, claiming the first gold medal for the Hong Kong, China Delegation at this year's Paralympic Games," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His gold medal is well-deserved. All Hong Kong people and I are thrilled and proud of his outstanding performance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR has won three medals at the Paralympics so far, which include a silver and bronze in swimming.

    SAR primed for new productive forces: Beijing official

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A top Beijing official in Hong Kong on Monday said the SAR is the most suitable place to develop new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a summit, Zheng Yanxiong, the director of Beijing's liaison office, said talent is key, as he hailed Hong Kong's top-notch research and development teams, as well as its convenient global connections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is an international financial centre. Finance and innovation and technology are intertwined, and Hong Kong has incubated more than 4,200 start-ups. It is a petrol station for the development of new quality productive forces," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has unique and unparalleled conditions to develop new quality productive forces."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng also brought up "tourism is everywhere", a concept suggested by Xia Baolong, the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trade should think about how to make good use of the beautiful 1,180 kilometres of coastline and 263 islands, how to support Hong Kong's tourism with animation, performing arts, e-sports, healthcare, artificial intelligence and coastal sports, and how to provide a top destination for leisure and vacation for the more than 500 million middle- and high-class people on the mainland," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, at the same event, vowed to speed up the development of new quality productive forces and said overseas talent will be a focus for the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government is fully committed to providing broader space for entrepreneurship and employment for talents in innovation and technology, encouraging industry and academia to work together to cultivate them, and to offer them richer practical opportunities," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we continue to improve our talent schemes to attract more global talent and to become a place for high-end international talent to gather."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a newspaper interview, Lee said those who came to Hong Kong via various talent schemes generally earn more than the median monthly income.

 The Liberal Party on Monday called on the government to provide the TV rights for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles for free to major broadcasters in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party surveyed 1,047 people, with around 70 percent of them backing the idea of the government buying the official rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities secured the television rights for the Paris Olympics, enabling live broadcasts on four free-to-air television channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Southern District Councillor Jonathan Leung, who is also from the Liberal Party, said the free broadcasting rights had ignited an Olympic fervour across the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said the government should ensure that people in Hong Kong could watch the Los Angeles Games for free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This Olympics, we can see that the media tried so hard to broadcast, to show our citizens how good this Olympics is. I believe they all benefited from the free broadcasting this year," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they would [be] happy to see the government purchase the next Olympics broadcasting [rights], and they would share the benefit. I think it's good for all of us - the television, the media, and the citizens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to concerns over the remuneration local athletes receive, Leung called on businesses to offer more sponsorship and job opportunities to athletes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A green turtle that was rescued in 2022 was released back into the sea on Monday, according to a spokesman from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The turtle had been under the care of Ocean Park Hong Kong (OPHK) since it was rescued by AFCD staff from waters near Chi Ma Wan Peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The green turtle weighs around 39 kilogrammes, and its carapace length measures about 66 centimetres. It was assessed by the veterinarians of OPHK as being in good condition and ready to return to the sea," an AFCD spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The department is thankful to the veterinarians and staff of OPHK for taking care of it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers released the green turtle in the southern waters of Hong Kong, adding that a microchip, tag and satellite transmitter have been attached to it for future identification, and for tracking its movements and feeding grounds for conservation purposes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green turtles are a globally endangered species and the only sea turtle known to nest locally.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho on Monday said that public housing tenants would soon be able to enjoy a better living environment that is more age-friendly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as the Housing Bureau and Housing Authority offered a glimpse on their well-being design guide for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team came up with eight concepts - health and vitality; green living and sustainability; age-friendly; inter-generational and inclusive living; family and community connection; urban connectivity; upward mobility; perception and image - after visiting 26 housing estates across 17 districts to seek the views of over 3,000 residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, under the inter-generational and inclusive living concept, a special area would be set up for vehicles such as medical vans, allowing residents easy access to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It may not just serve the elderly persons, although sometimes the health-related mobile services may relate to the elderly persons more, but there are also mobile libraries which the children and young mothers would be very interested in," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other facilities to improve the living environment include items such as exercise stations at convenient locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also gave an example on how a facility could achieve age inclusivity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Very usually, we see the grandparents bring their grandchildren to the playground. So if the grandchildren were playing, where should the grandparents sit?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Can they sit comfortably under the tree when they watch the children play, and at the same time, can the grandparents can have a social chat to share necessary information? That is the kind of environment we want to create,” Ho added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pilot programme will be launched at five existing estates - Kai Yip Estate, Fu Shan Estate, Chak On Estate, Shui Pin Wai Estate, and Mei Lam Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is believed that Hin Fat Estate and Yip Wong Road Phase 2 (Yip Wong Estate) will be the first two projects built under the new guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calvin Au, a researcher at the think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation, welcomes the introduction of the design guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au told RTHK that the authorities have to design public housing based on the needs of residents there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Different people have different needs. The challenges would be how to pick the right design recommendation from the guide to apply to the right estate," he explained
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the architect and policymakers, they really have to have a good sense of what is the population they are planning to serve, the data, so they know about the population mix and they know what they need."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au also said it's important to cater to the needs of elderly residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our population is ageing, our building is ageing, and our senior residents have difficulty in their daily life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This guideline... can really gather resources across sectors and across society to really apply the newest technology and the newest design in a larger scenario such as public housing estate, which can really push forward the development of the age-friendly community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The details of the guidelines will be unveiled next Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The well-being design guide was proposed in Chief Executive John Lee’s maiden policy address back in 2022.

    Mixed feelings on first day back at school

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong pupils on Monday had mixed feelings about going back to school, with some happy to see their old friends again and others saying they wished the summer holiday was longer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I slept at around 9.30 last night because I was playing with my dad. [I miss the holiday] because I still want to play," said one pupil studying at a Tin Shui Wai school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another pupil said she was nervous because there would be many new faces in class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Education Secretary Christine Choi wished pupils a good start to the academic year, and highlighted the need for mental health support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said as of July, more than 420 schools had signed up for the government's 4Rs Mental Health Charter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 4Rs stand for rest, relaxation, relationship and resilience, and the charter is designed to address the plight of students struggling with their mental well-being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know some schools have their own mental health support programmes for students in progress or in future," she told reporters at a secondary school in Tuen Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that as those plans are gradually integrated, more and more schools will participate in the 4Rs mental health charter, to encourage students to rest and relax, improve their resilience, and establish good interpersonal relationships."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau has sent six advisory letters to follow up on a primary pupil who has reportedly been absent from school for more than two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the bureau hopes to help the pupil get back to school as soon as possible by getting in touch with different stakeholders.

 The observatory on Monday said it might issue the Standby Signal No.1 between Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night, with Tropical Cyclone Yagi intensifying into a severe tropical storm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said Yagi would be within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong on Tuesday and then edge close to the coast of southern China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added there was a high chance Yagi would move towards the vicinity of the western part of Guangdong and Hainan Island and would further intensify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the observatory forecast Yagi could strengthen to a typhoon by Thursday.

  Ng returned to the pool one night after finishing sixth in the women's SM6 200 metres individual medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paralympic debutant was second at the halfway mark of the SB6 100 metres breaststroke final, before being leapfrogged by China's world-record holder, Liu Daomin, towards the end.
  <br/>

  Ng touched the wall at 1:34.15, nearly two seconds behind Liu for bronze, while Britain's Maisie Summers-Newton retained her gold.

   Speaking after the race, Ng has set her sights on improving her stamina.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm happy I finished the event and won the second medal for team Hong Kong. For the last 25 metres, I couldn't maintain my pace. When I return to Hong Kong after the Paralympics, I hope to train harder and give my best in another competition," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Patients will be able to pick up their medications at community pharmacies from next week, the Hospital Authority (HA) has announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HA launched a medication delivery service last year, allowing patients to receive their medications at home or at the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it will expand this service and allow patients to collect their medications at over 100 community pharmacies, under Mannings and Watsons, from September 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  William Chui, chief pharmacist with the HA, said it would provide one more option for patients, and they will be able to receive professional help as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have the professional, the community pharmacists, provide counselling and also drug information to patients who want more information about their medication or drug treatment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So [it's] not only for the delivery of the drugs but also providing immediate service or professional service to the patient."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui said the HA would look into expanding the scope to cover more pharmacies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the HA also aims to encourage Hong Kong residents to make use of primary healthcare services to reduce the workload on public hospitals and clinics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Pharmacists in the community provide information, and also professional advice on how to prevent disease, how to improve patients' health overall. I think this is a good start to let our patients make use of healthcare professionals in the community," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Teenage swimmer Jasmine Ng clinched her first Paralympic bronze medal for Hong Kong, China, in the women’s 100m breaststroke SB6 event, becoming the youngest Hong Kong Paralympic medallist.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old touched home in a time of 1:34.15, less than three seconds behind British Maisie Summers-Newton who smashed the Paralympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Daomin took silver for the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng is now Hong Kong's youngest-ever Para medallist, refreshing the previous record set by legendary sprinter So Wa-wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 14 years and five months old, she is five months younger than So when he took home his first Paralympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the race, the teenager has set her sights on improving her stamina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy I finished the event and won the second medal for team Hong Kong. For the last 25 metres, I couldn't maintain my pace. When I return to Hong Kong after the Paralympics, I hope to train harder and give my best in another competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the final of the mixed 4-by-100m Freestyle Relay S14, the SAR team of Chan Yui-lam, Cheung Ho-ying, Andy Cheung and Tang Wai-lok finished fourth out of five, clocking a time of 3:55.20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain took gold, Australia bagged silver and Brazil rounded off the podium.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One in five teenagers exhibited symptoms of depression or anxiety, according to a survey released on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service, an NGO providing mental health support and counselling, interviewed 1,646 secondary pupils between last November and April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 25 percent of the respondents even displayed "medium" to "severe" levels of depression. When asked to self-evaluate, many said they felt useless, had nothing to look forward to or hated their lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 37 percent of them also expressed dissatisfaction with their academic performance, while one in four felt distressed about their appearance and body shape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The situation is "concerning", according to Scarlet Poon Fung Oi, the group's assistant chief executive officer who reported the findings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, she believed the existing three-tier school-based emergency system is effective in identifying pupils with suicidal risks or high mental health needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government introduced the scheme in December last year with an aim to offer timely assistance to students going through mental health issues. The response came after multiple teenagers took their own lives in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical psychologist Jeff Kei advised teenagers to proactively seek help when needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes we tend to avoid or even suppress our emotions. This may help us navigate the world when we are stressed but in the long run, actually it may lead to more emotional problems," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think the first thing teenagers can do is to recognise and acknowledge their feelings. There are many online services or resources that can help them enhance their emotional well-being. So, don't hesitate to look for these resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the new school year begins on Monday, Kei also called on teachers and parents to offer additional support to pupils grappling with mental health issues.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday that preparations are underway at the Kai Tak Sports Park for a grand opening ceremony in the first quarter of next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his social media page, Lee said he and a number of his top officials inspected the sports park last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the main structure of the public sports ground, indoor sports centre and main stadium are almost complete, while the interior decoration and landscaping construction are still in progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the inspection, I asked the working group to ensure that the Kai Tak Sports Park is successfully completed and opened as scheduled to consolidate Hong Kong’s strategic positioning as a city of major events. At the same time, I reminded staff to pay attention to implementation details, strengthen adaptability and ensure smooth operations after the park is completed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kai Tak Sports Park will conduct different drills and trial opening activities before its official opening to allow for adjustments… it will also adjust strategies as needed to improve response efficiency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a video posted on the CE’s social media page, the main stadium will have about eight floors, with a seating capacity of 50,000. There will also be 28 concession stands and five bars, with one being amongst the longest in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said many local sports stars and artists are slated to attend the grand opening ceremony next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes that the new, state-of-the-art venue will not only drive sports development, but also generate substantial economic benefits to Hong Kong by stimulating the growth of the performing arts, tourism and other sectors.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong has what it takes to be a regional processing hub for Australian exports, ahead of his five-day duty visit down under.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The financial chief departed for Sydney on Sunday. He will also visit Melbourne before returning to the SAR on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said he hopes to achieve three objectives in his latest trip, with luring investment being top of his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the highlights of this visit is to meet enterprises in the fields of biomedicine, new energy and fintech, and I will promote Hong Kong's strategic advantages and hopefully get them to set up shop in the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similarly, Chan also hoped to strengthen cooperation in green technology, citing his goal to develop Hong Kong into a "green finance centre" under this year's Budget.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also noted that Hong Kong imported HK$14.8 billion worth of Australian goods last year, including fresh produce, seafood and wine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia is now the city's second-largest source of imported wine by value, and the largest by volume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's highly interconnected and accessible air freight network, well-developed storage facilities and efficient customs clearance have made it a cost-effective transshipment hub for high-value goods," Chan explained, adding there is potential to further boost trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from meeting local business leaders, Chan will also attend an Asia Summit organised by the Australian Financial Review, and deliver a keynote speech.

    HK needs to beef up tech investment: Sun Dong

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong still has a long way to go before it can become a Silicon Valley-style international technology hub, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said the SAR has rolled out measures to boost the sector over the past two years, noting that the target of attracting 100 I&T enterprises to the territory within five years has been achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said there’s room to further boost investment in cutting-edge technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Hong Kong] government is investing more money on frontier technologies. Last year, it spent 1.07 percent of GDP on this, which is a record for Hong Kong. However, this is still low compared to nearby regions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, the mainland spends 2.7 to 2.8 percent of its GDP on research and technology. Cities like Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai spend even more, over 5 percent of their GDP."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the government needs to consider how to make the most out of its investments given the current financial climate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech chief also highlighted the need for the SAR to enhance its role as a super connector and super value-adder to lure more global talent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities said people who're caught feeding wild pigeons will no longer get any verbal warning and will instead face immediate, on-the-spot fines of HK$5,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said pigeon feeders will face instant enforcement measures, after an amendment to Hong Kong's wildlife protection law came into effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Amendment Ordinance has already been in effect for a month," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enforcement officers will take immediate enforcement action without prior verbal warnings upon discovering any person who is found to be illegally feeding wild animals or feral pigeons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the changes approved by the Legislative Council in May, the maximum penalty for feeding wild animals has also been raised to a one-year prison term and a fine of HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AFCD noted that officers will step up patrols across the territory, and work closely with other department to conduct joint enforcement operations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China's badminton and boccia players closed in on medals at the Paris Paralympics late on Saturday, though two swimming finalists missed out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In badminton, Daniel Chan, a bronze medalist in Tokyo, will take on South Korea's Yu Sooyoung in the semi-final of the men's WH2 on Sunday after comfortably topping his group by beating rivals from Chile and Malaysia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chu Man-kai, the top seed in the men's SH6 competition after taking silver in Tokyo, won all three pool games to earn himself a bye through the quarter-finals. He beat opponents from Britain, India and Indonesia to top Group A, and will go again in tonight's semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two women's boccia players also secured semi-final places in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After topping her group in the women's individual BC4, Annie Cheung took control of her quarter-final, beating Laissa Polyana Teixeira of Brazil 4-1. Cheung is at her first Paralympics and next takes on  Malaysia's Noor Askuzaimey Mat Salim in the semi-final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Yuen-kei had to come from behind to win her BC3 quarter-final against Kla-Han Ladamanee of Thailand, scoring twice in the final end to seal a 3-2 victory. She next faces Kang Sunhee for a place in the final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmers Tang Wai-lok and Andy Cheung missed out in the final of the men's  S14 200m freestyle, as Britain's William Ellard smashed the world record to take gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who won gold in the same event in the Rio 2016 Games, finished seventh while Cheung, who is making his Paralympic debut at the age of 19, finished eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ellard dominated from start to finish, taking more than a second off the record with a time of 1min 51.30 seconds. Nicholas Bennett of Canada and Australia's Jack Ireland took silver and bronze respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's Chan Yui-lam and Cheung Ho-ying bowed out in the semi-finals of the equivalent women's event. The S14 category is for swimmers with intellectual disabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang will be back in action in the S14 100m backstroke and the SM14 200m medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's sole para athletics representative, Yam Kwok-fan, missed out on a place in the final of the women's T36 200 metres, finishing fifth in her heat. She's got the 100m coming up later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in boccia, Hong Kong's Leung Yuk-wing saw his campaign end at the quarter-final stage in the men's individual BC4 event. After finishing second in his group, he was beaten 6-1 by Britain's Stephen McGuire in the early hours of Sunday. He'll be back later in the mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BC2 competition, Yeung Hiu-lam was beaten by Britain's Claire Taggart 3-2 in the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Sunday, John Loung of Hong Kong takes on Huadpradit Witsanu of Thailand in men's BC1 quarter-final.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The national security police said on Saturday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of "doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention" in relation to a suicide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 41-year-old male suspect had allegedly put memorial light boxes in various places, while a 28-year-old woman is suspected of publishing falsified last words of the deceased.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said the contents provoked hatred towards the central authorities and the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers holding a court warrant searched the duo's homes in Kowloon and the New Territories yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They seized light boxes, materials for making the boxes and electronic communication devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees were detained for investigation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay flight heading to Hong Kong from Kaohsiung remained grounded just before take-off after one of the aircraft's engines reportedly caught fire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airline said the CX431 flight was scheduled to depart at 11.20 am on Saturday, but one of its engines encountered technical problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online videos showed that the flight was preparing for take off on the tarmac, when the engine suddenly shot out of flames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A loud bang was heard, and the aircraft later came to a halt on the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline said no passengers or crew were hurt in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Members of the national team on Saturday said their goodbyes to Hong Kong, saying they were delighted to meet the crowds and were surprised by their enthusiastic reactions, as the delegation of 65 mainland athletes wrapped up their three-day visit to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meeting the press before their departure, weightlifter Li Fabin, who also visited Hong Kong with a delegation three years ago, shared his thoughts on the visit this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time there weren't that many crowds because of the pandemic…This time in Hong Kong, people have been incredibly enthusiastic, something I haven't seen before. The cheers and applause from the Hong Kong residents have deeply touched our hearts and are a strong source of support for us," the two-time Olympic gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also mentioned that he plans to defend his men’s 61 kg title at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving queen Quan Hongchan was asked about her secret to success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's all about staying calm, happy, and not overthinking," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun Yingsha from the table tennis team visited the Hong Kong Sports Institute on Friday. She said she's thrilled to have had the chance to exchange and interact with Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel like Hong Kong’s overall table tennis standard has improved a lot. From my visit to the Sports Institute yesterday, whether in terms of training equipment or the logistical support, I think it’s getting better. I hope that we can all work hard together for the common goal of fighting for the country,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Synchronised swimmer Wang Qianyi and her elder twin sister Wang Liuyi will pursue PhD degrees at the Education University of Hong Kong in the coming academic year. She said they were looking forward to studying in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've always wanted to experience the campus atmosphere. We hope to enhance ourselves while enjoying the campus life and experiencing different aspects of life beyond training," Wang Qianyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday afternoon, the delegation left Hong Kong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, headed to Macau for a three-day visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official Facebook, Chief Executive John Lee thanked the delegation for bringing an unforgettable experience to Hongkongers and filling the city with a strong sports atmosphere in the past three days.

    Unions make appeals ahead of Policy Address

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768482_1_20240902154822.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Various workers' rights groups on Saturday submitted a series of proposals to Chief Executive John Lee ahead of his third Police Address in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suggestions include calls for standard working hours, a higher minimum wage, universal retirement protection, and improved occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the organisations, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, urged the government to review a scheme that reimburses medical expenses for employees injured at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Up to now, the medical expenses [reimbursement] depends on the fee of the public hospital, so that the injured worker only can take back HK$300 per day for their medical expenses for treatment. We think that this amount is not enough for their treatment and recovery,” said Lam Ching-yee, the association’s organiser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association also called for the cost of imaging examination services, such as X-ray scans, CT scans and MRI scans, at private clinics to be covered, allowing injured workers to quickly find out their treatment options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, unionists representing property management and security guards urged the government to promote a standard working week of 44 hours and raise the minimum wage to no less than HK$56 per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that security guards are overworked while receiving wages that are not livable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A carer concern group called for changes to the Social Welfare Department's caregiver allowance. It suggested eliminating the eligibility review mechanism, lower application thresholds, and allow caregivers to receive the allowance in their own name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many groups also pointed to the need for a universal retirement protection scheme, advocating for a tripartite contribution model where the government, large businesses, and individual employees all contribute to the pension system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Saturday entertained cheering crowds in Hong Kong by putting on spectacular sporting displays, as the delegation of 65 mainland athletes wrapped up their three-day visit to the territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Divers and swimmers headed to Victoria Park swimming pool, with synchronised swimming twins Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi kicking off the ticket-only demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those taking a dive into the pool was fan favourite Quan Hongchan, who received roaring cheers. The 17-year-old won the women's individual and synchronised 10m platform competitions at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quan, who brought along her famous collection of turtle toys, introduced herself to the audience in Cantonese and ended the post-demonstration interview with a signature blessing: " Kung hei fat choy!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow diver Chen Yiwen, who won two golds at the Paris Olympics, also climbed the steps to the springboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is interesting to be able to showcase diving in such way. It's not as serious as in competitions," Chen said. "We perform in an entertaining way, and we also interact with everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations at the pool later turned cheeky with a series of wacky dives and fun leaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai, athletes from land-based disciplines wowed spectators with showcases of gymnastics, badminton and table tennis, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton mixed doubles champions Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong demonstrated some techniques alongside women's doubles duo Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan, with the latter pair also trading partners with the SAR's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam for a showdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To add some more fun, Sheng Lihao, who won in the men's 10m air rifle in Paris, also took a shot in badminton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team's clean sweep of gold medals in table tennis did not go unnoticed at the stadium amid loud applause from the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lucky spectator was picked to play against ping pong legend Ma Long, with women's singles champion Chen Meng guiding her, hand in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd also caught a glimpse of the breakdancing scene from bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, also known as "671".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rounding up the demonstrations in Wan Chai was a video speech from Hong Kong's sole two-time Olympic gold medallist, Edgar Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be able to appreciate the grace of so many world number ones at such a close distance is really a rare thing. It's pity that I am not in Hong Kong, so I can't be here in person to participate in this event," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's events marked the end of a visit by the national team to Hong Kong, which next heads to neighbouring Macau.

    Talent scheme focus is on abilities: Chris Sun

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Talent scheme focus is on abilities: Chris Sun" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768464_1_20240831111624.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The labour minister said on Saturday that the focus remains on the abilities as well as the perspectives of imported talents, instead of their nationalities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 95 percent of those coming to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme are from the mainland, but Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun emphasised that it does not make the scheme any less international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, the minister pointed out that most of the talent coming from Category C of the scheme - full-time bachelor's degree graduates in the past five years with less than three years of work experience - attained their degrees from universities in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While they may be mainlanders, they received their higher education in America. Obviously, they have a more international perspective. With these people in Hong Kong, I am sure they are going to bring benefits and will add value to our economy," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of talent is expected to apply for a visa renewal as soon as early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said the bureau is still conducting a review of the scheme, which was rolled out in 2022, and plans to diversify its pool of overseas talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that Malaysia will be the authorities' first destination in Southeast Asia, citing the compatibility with the ethnic Chinese community there who are mostly trilingual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said the government has approved 21,000 applications for the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed that if the shortage of local labour forces is alleviated, the authority will "definitely" reduce its quotas for imported labour.

<div class="itemFullText">
 As the new school year begins on Monday, a psychologist is urging parents to pay attention to their children's emotional, physiological and behavioural well-being.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheryl So, a senior clinical psychologist at Kwai Chung Hospital, stressed that students of different ages face different forms of stress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While pre-schoolers struggle to leave their comfort zones and adapt to unfamiliar environments, primary and secondary school students are expected to learn to be independent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents are advised to look out for signs of potential problems such as depression, extreme mood swings, headaches, stomachaches, prolonged sleep disturbances, fear of separation from family or excessive self-criticism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If such symptoms persist for more than a month, they should seek professional help," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that teachers and parents can play different roles depending on the developmental stage of their students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Like for kindergarten, for parents, I think the first day of school is better to give them a very positive goodbye. They have to leave familiar people. They have to go to some uncharted area, that is, school," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For more than two decades, the hospital has worked with the education sector and charities to raise awareness of mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 16,000 students from over 100 schools have taken part in programmes that facilitate interaction with people who have recovered from mental health problems, with the aim of combating stigma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We provide some talk on common mental health issues students will face. And then we'll also teach them some stress management, emotion regulation skills. We also provide some workshops to train them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How to deal with mental health issues... how to interact with a person in recovery... so through the contact with them, they will realise mental illness is not that horrible. And they will have a more accurate understanding of mental illness and better experience with people in recovery."

  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday strongly condemned untruthful remarks smearing the freedom of press in Hong Kong, after former editors of the now-defunct Stand News were convicted of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in a statement, the authorities said officials from the United States and Western countries, anti-China organisations and some foreign media had made "untruthful and purely political" remarks regarding the judgment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said freedom of the press is protected under Hong Kong law, but it stressed that reporters must follow the principle of "responsible journalism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Like all other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. Journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. Their freedom of commenting on and criticising government policies remains uninhibited as long as they do not violate the law," it wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the media and relevant personnel publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including protection of national security or public order, or of public health or morals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities pointed out that the District Court had said the relevant reports and articles by Stand News were not based on facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reasons for verdict have also pointed out clearly that the ideology of Stand News was localism which excluded China, and that it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government during the 'anti-extradition amendment bill incidents'," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government added that the United States and Western countries had "double standards", as these countries have carried out enforcement actions against the dissemination of disinformation and incitement of hatred.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Friday showed off some of their skills and shared insights and stories from the Paris Games at an evening gala.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium was one of the events where local fans could interact with the competitors during their three-day visit to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening of the show, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong residents had been looking forward to meeting the elite athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the Olympics, Hong Kong had a fiery atmosphere for the Games, and residents watched free broadcasts through the night to support the mainland and SAR athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From watching the broadcast from ten thousand miles away, to seeing the athletes first-hand, I believe everyone is excited and looking forward to the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes shared positive vibes with Hong Kong fans, and showcased their skills at the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I, of course, have to play for my country on the court, but in life, I think we need to chill out, and be happy. I hope everyone can spend every day happily," table tennis player Sun Yingsha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shuttler Zheng Siwei said he missed his usual mixed doubles teammate Huang Yaqiong after being assigned a new partner. However, he was happy to be reunited with Huang at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People only cherish something after losing it. I believe everyone’s experienced this before. Please cherish the one who fights alongside with you and the one who accompanies you," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And some national team athletes, such as table tennis player Fan Zhendong and diver Quan Hongchan, used Cantonese to greet the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A few SAR Olympians, such as gold medal fencer Vivian Kong, and shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet, were also at the stadium and shared their experiences with the audience.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday said it has fined WeChat Pay Hong Kong for failing to prevent risks associated with the financing of terrorism and money laundering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following an investigation, the digital wallet service provider was ordered to pay a penalty of HK$875,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said WeChat Pay Hong Kong does not have a robust system for conducting customer due diligence reviews upon incidents that pose a risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKMA executive director Raymond Chan urged mobile wallet service operators to strengthen their due diligence procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVF (Stored Value Facilities) licensees should apply enhanced due diligence measures on their customers in situations involving potentially high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing," Chan said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These enhanced due diligence measures should be effective in ensuring that the associated money laundering and terrorist financing risks are properly managed."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Social Workers Association (HKSWA) on Friday urged local employers to recruit more disabled people when considering their hiring needs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the number of disabled people who had attained a bachelor's degree from eight UGC-funded universities tripled to around 1,500 in the academic year spanning 2023 to 2024, compared to four years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKSWA recommended that companies be given training before hiring people with disabilities, so they can be assigned tasks according to their strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Athena Ng, who is visually impaired, said she was worried about communicating with her peers in the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most people rely on visuals on when they communicate. For example, they would point at a particular object when referring to it. But the visually impaired are unable to [do that], leading to communication issues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng now works for a product development company that cooperates with the Hong Kong Blind Union to train the disabled as badminton racket stringers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director Kwan Wing-fai revealed his company has employed four disabled persons - all but one suffered from hearing difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was concerned about their working abilities to begin with, but he found these worries were unfounded as they performed even better than able-bodied people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They completed the project on time and even completed it earlier than our target. I think they give me the confidence to employ the disabled again," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Kwan from the HKSWA's Professional Development Committee said many non-governmental organisations are doing a good job in supporting people with disabilities by providing them with training and counselling services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I think the government may do more, for example, the government can support NGOs, to give more resources to NGOs to promote or support enterprises to foster an inclusive culture in the business sector."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 11.8 percent in July compared to the same month last year, marking the fifth month of declines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Friday showed the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.1 billion in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slump follows a 9.7 percent drop in June and an 11.4 percent decrease in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined further in July from a year earlier amid the continued impact of the change in consumption patterns and the strong Hong Kong dollar," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More outbound travels by residents during the summer holidays was also one of the factors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the government said challenges remain, but the authorities will continue to support small and medium-sized enterprises, including those in the retail industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Friday called on the government to encourage students from countries involved in the Belt and Road initiative to work in Hong Kong after completing their studies here.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The request is part of the university's proposals to Chief Executive John Lee for his policy address in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, the university's vice-president for research and innovation, Christopher Chao, said the government should increase subsidies and scholarships for these students, adding that the advantages of doing so extend beyond the education sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because when we are going to all these 'One Belt One Road' countries, apart from the educational part, in fact, we are also talking about a possibility of doing investment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we are talking about the investment ecosystem, we are talking about how these things can be integrated together."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chao also urged the authorities to extend the Strive and Rise programme – which pairs students from underprivileged backgrounds with volunteer mentors – to countries participating in the Belt and Road initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such a move would help children in developing nations, while enhancing the global image of Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday re-appointed former lawmaker Lam Tai-fai as the head of RTHK's advisory board, with his new two-year term beginning on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said five other board members were re-appointed, including media veteran Ronald Chiu and former Law Society president Thomas So.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board has provided invaluable advice to the Director of Broadcasting and assisted RTHK in fulfilling its public purposes and mission as set out in the Charter of RTHK," Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am grateful that Lam and the five incumbent members have accepted reappointment to continue serving on the Board."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also announced seven new members to the body, including City University governing council member Robert Lui, sports scholar Jim Luk, NGO chief Kitty Chau and Meggy Cheng, a top executive at a local dance academy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister thanked the outgoing members, which include lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen and Chinese University media scholar Anthony Fung, for their contributions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers had the chance to meet members of the national Olympic team on Friday, as a delegation held various meet-and-greet events on the second day of a three-day visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A group of 65 competitors from Team China are in the SAR to celebrate their success at this year's Games, after bringing home 91 medals from Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some competitors went to the Sports Institute and a school, where many aspiring athletes and students waited in anticipation to meet them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One girl, 10, came with a portrait of her favourite athletes, saying meeting them was an opportunity she could not pass up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I live in the building next door. I was doing my summer homework when I saw the athletes coming out of the car outside my window. I told my mom to immediately take me there to meet them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I watched most of the competition that they had broadcast. As long as I can see my favourite athletes, no matter how much sacrifice or hard work, I am happy and willing to do so."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A form 1 student surnamed Ho waited outside the Sports Institute in the hope of meeting the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope I can interact with them up close. I really like Ma Long, Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha. I started noticing Ma Long after watching the last Olympics and that inspired me to take up table tennis. I started the sport because of him," the boy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, some athletes participated in a meet-and-greet event with the disciplined services at the Fire and Ambulance Services Academy to showcase their skills and interact with young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fans cheered as the athletes entered the stadium in an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the exchange session, some youth representatives got to play table tennis against Ma and Fan Zhendong, who made do with a pot lid and a spatula as their paddles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said he was honoured and excited that the mainland athletes had come to Hong Kong, and praised them for their perseverance and unyielding spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My favourite is weightlifter Li Wenwen. She picked up her coach after she won gold and shouted 'We're done with work!' Wasn't that so exciting?," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The national team's perseverance, superior skillset, passionate performance and dedication to the country are all in line with Hong Kong's disciplinary forces, and also the spirit of the disciplinary forces."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation was to visit Victoria Peak and Victoria Harbour in the afternoon to take in the sights, before a gala show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will end on Saturday with sporting demonstrations in the morning for the public to enjoy, including badminton, gymnastics, table tennis, diving and swimming.

    Beijing blasts criticism of Stand News court verdict

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768297_1_20240830114245.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has hit out at statements made by the United States, Britain and the European Union after a court convicted two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller called the verdict "a direct attack on media freedom", while Britain's foreign office minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West, said the SAR administration should "end politicised prosecutions of journalists and uphold press and publication freedoms" and the European Union said the ruling was "yet another sign of the dwindling space for press freedom".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said the court's decision safeguarded national security and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson also criticised the West of using press freedom as a political tool to make excuses for anti-China organisations, and smearing and attacking the rule of law in the SAR to advocate the so-called "chilling effect".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It went to say that press freedom in the territory has been better protected under a safe and stable environment following the implementation of the national security laws, and urged relevant politicians to stop harbouring criminals and interfering in the SAR's judicial and internal affairs.

    Vulnerable newborns to get dedicated care at hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The multidisciplinary team at Queen Mary Hospital. Photo Courtesy of the Hospital Authority" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768278_1_20240830085501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Mary Hospital has set up a multi-disciplinary team of professionals to look after babies born prematurely, while providing psychological and even palliative support for parents in case of emergencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 43-strong team comprises obstetric and paediatric healthcare professionals, clinical psychologists, and social workers. It has helped the parents of over 20 babies since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team springs into action whenever a baby is delivered between 23 and 25 weeks, the so-called periviability interval where medical intervention is often needed in order for the newborn to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to a quarter of the infants also develop severe disabilities later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading the team is Mimi Seto, an associate consultant at the hospital's Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said apart from caring for premature babies, the team also intervenes by delaying pre-term labour for expecting mothers by prescribing them medication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We use] antenatal steroid drugs to enhance the fetal lung maturity, and give them magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If needed, if [the mothers] are in pre-term labour, having regular contractions, we might also give the mother tocolytic therapy, which is a drug to stop the uterus from contracting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The logic, Seto said, is to allow the baby to receive sufficient prenatal treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she admitted tocolytic therapy may have side effects to the mother, even though it is safe most of the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some cases, the hospital also provides palliative care to parents, including counselling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seto suggested all mothers-to-be, especially those with a history of pre-term birth, to seek antenatal care as soon as their pregnancy begins and follow the advice by obstetricians.

 Members of the national team arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday to celebrate their success at this year's Olympics, with a delegation including 59 competitors who were either individual champions or part of winning teams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of 65 competitors were in the SAR for a three-day visit, with events including an evening reception and banquet hosted by the Hong Kong government, followed by a gala show and sporting demonstrations in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the athletes at a banquet, Chief Executive John Lee said their visit will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to pursue careers in the sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking back, the mainland's Olympic athletes delegation has visited Hong Kong several times. Their visits not only enhance emotional exchanges of the people between the two places, but also facilitate the exchange and development of sports culture," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that this visit will further deepen the profound friendship between Hong Kong and the mainland. It will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to engage in sports careers and strive for excellence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation visiting the SAR was all-time great in table tennis, Ma Long, sporting a gold from the team event – the sixth he has won in his illustrious career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meet-the-media event, Ma said it was the fourth time he had joined a visit to Hong Kong, adding that he is always touched by the warm greetings he receives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time around, I hope to have more opportunities to communicate with the young people in Hong Kong. I think this would definitely be a special memory in my career," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After the Olympics, many people have been asking me about my future plans. As of now, I am still an athlete. Of course, if there are any changes, I will definitely let everyone know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving superstar Quan Hongchan had captured the hearts of many fans with her cute personality as she struck gold again in the women's individual 10 metres platform and the synchronised 10 metres platform with teammate Chen Yuxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think if you have passion, go for it. Don’t be afraid of failure. I would also like to thank everyone for liking me so much," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, swimmer Pan Zhanle, who made headlines for his world record-setting victory in the 100 metres freestyle, said he was looking forward to meeting the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will first train myself well. When I become more mature, I can then be a role model for others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team won a total of 91 medals at the Paris Games, including 40 golds, 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

 Two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News were found guilty on Thursday of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen and acting chief editor Patrick Lam were convicted of conspiring to publish and reproduce seditious publications between July 2020 and December 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News' parent company, Best Pencil Limited, was also found guilty of the same offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written judgement, District Court judge Kwok Wai-kin ruled that 11 of the 17 publications raised by the prosecution were seditious, noting the political climate at the time was extremely heated and many people were unhappy with the SAR and central governments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The published materials included interviews with opposition figures as well as commentaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that the political ideology of Stand News was localism and its stance was to "support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the anti-extradition bill movement, it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government,” Kwok wrote in the judgement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that Chung knew and approved of the articles’ seditious intentions and offered Stand News as a platform to incite hatred against central and SAR authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge also noted that Lam approved one of the articles found to be seditious, while at the same time voicing support for the anti-extradition bill movement in a forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict, originally slated for last October, was postponed three times pending an appeal in a separate sedition case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing has been adjourned to September 26, and both Chung and Lam were freed on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They each face up to two years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was absent from the hearing on Thursday due to a health issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence lawyer Audrey Eu read Lam’s mitigation letter in court, which said Stand News journalists sought to run a news outlet with fully independent editorial standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Journalists are not only responsible for their own reports. They are also failing in their duty if they deliberately avoid reporting when they know the public has the right to be informed,” Eu quoted Lam as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also revealed that Lam is suffering from a “rare disease” that required chemotherapy, and it would be difficult for him to receive medical care if jailed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written mitigation letter submitted to the court, Chung said it is the “inescapable responsibility” of journalists to report the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior counsel Eu told the court that both defendants had spent over 10 months behind bars before getting bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News closed down in December 2021 after police raided its office and froze its assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the court after the verdict, chief superintendent from the national security unit, Steve Li, said police welcomed the court's decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the national security department took the enforcement against the Stand News on December 2021, some people criticised us that we are suppressing the freedom of the speech and the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the judge's verdict has clearly illustrated the necessity and the lawfulness of the enforcement [action] taken on that day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at another event, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said authorities respected and valued media freedom, which is protected by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all journalists report based on facts, I think there would not be situations restricting the freedom of the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Criticising the government is not an action that is not allowed. We see news articles criticising the government every day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late Thursday evening, a government spokesman said "any individual or organisation that incites hatred and engages in acts and activities endangering national security can never escape sanctions of the law, and such malicious acts will surely be duly punished."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement added, "To distort words and acts that incite hatred as 'journalistic work' as such individuals and organisations did is indeed the gravest insult against the professional journalists of Hong Kong."
