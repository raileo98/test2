<div class="itemFullText">
 Finnish conductor Tarmo Peltokoski has been named the new music director of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HK Phil), succeeding Dutch maestro Jaap van Zweden from the 2026-27 season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old is the youngest director in the philharmonic's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his debut with the orchestra at a concert in June last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK Radio 4, Peltokoski compared the experience of leading the HK Phil to driving a luxury car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's absolutely world class. So it's a luxury car, so to say. I actually don't drive actual cars, but now I can drive the HK Phil. I was super impressed. We had our first rehearsal, and I'm excited for the years to come," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The award-wining composer studied piano at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, and is also interested in music comedy and improvisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January 2022, he was awarded “Principal Guest Conductor” of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen in Germany, the first conductor to hold the position in the orchestra’s 42-year history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Cogman, chairman of HK Phil's board of governors, said he is delighted to welcome the Finnish musician on board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a remarkable and visionary musician, and we are very fortunate that he will write the next chapter in our orchestra’s history," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive of HK Phil, Benedikt Fohr, said the appointment of Peltokoski marked a significant milestone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a highly talented musician from the younger generation. Under his leadership, we wish to inspire a new generation of music lovers, and continue to enhance our artistic excellence and elevate our reputation in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested two women for allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old boy in Tseung Kwan O for crypto ransom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They received a report from a woman that her son was taken from a mall on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boy was rescued by officers in the flat of one of the suspects on Thursday morning. He had no apparent injury and was sent to hospital for observation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the two suspects had financial difficulties. They also said there's no evidence they knew the boy's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that one of the suspects took the victim by force and moved him to a quieter place nearby, like a park, in a stroller. Another suspect put the kid in a suitcase and then moved him to the flat," said chief superintendent Kwan King-pan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said one of the suspects is an HKID holder and the other holds a two-way permit. Both are 38 and unemployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspects asked the boy's family to pay the ransom in cryptocurrency possibly because it's harder to trace, but no ransom was paid.

    Govt to tender one residential site this quarter

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday announced that it will put only one residential site up for tender this quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A plot at Shiu Lek Yuen in Sha Tin is expected to generate 570 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the authorities will not be selling any commercial sites this quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is also a hard fact that the vacancy rate for the commercial floor area in the economy is now on the high side. According to some recent statistics, it is around 13 percent. So, taking into account the market condition, we think we have a reason not to roll out commercial sites in this quarter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also said the government's land sales, private property developments and urban renewal projects in the first two quarters will provide a total of 4,065 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will meet around one-third of the target of 13,200 units for this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to sell a total of eight residential sites this financial year, including six unsold sites from the previous land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Lands Department, only one piece of land was sold between April and June. The plot, which went for almost HK$82 million, will be used for a charging station for electric vehicles.

    Ladies only: KMB route driven solely by female drivers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In a first for Hong Kong, KMB has earmarked a bus route which will be served exclusively by female drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The franchised bus operator is also adding more female-friendly staff facilities in the hope of attracting more women to join its ranks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting this month, KMB's route 69 between Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long will be handled by 11 female bus captains. A second such route is also on the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A new resting room installed at the Tin Shui Wai terminus was also designed with female users in mind. It includes a changing room and a full-length mirror.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas Mak, head of operations at the company's Tuen Mun depot, said the bus operator is keen to smash a common stereotype that female drivers are not as good on the roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that women currently make up eight percent of KMB's 10,000 drivers. The company's goal is to increase this to 10 percent.

    STARLUX hopes to add more Hong Kong-Taipei flights

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taiwan-based airline STARLUX on Thursday said it aims to operate up to five daily round trips between the island and Hong Kong in the future.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its first flights between Hong Kong and Taipei will take off on July 16, with two round trips each day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tony Cho, the airline's mainland China chief representative and Hong Kong branch general manager, said the coming year is the right time to boost passenger flight frequency, when Chek Lap Kok's third runway comes into full operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline is capable of increasing its manpower from the current 18 members of staff stationed in Hong Kong, Cho added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to compete with each other among this industry, but we also cooperate with them," he said. "We need more frequency to serve Taiwan and Hong Kong, and other areas for our business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In celebration of the new flights, a STARLUX-themed tram will run until the end of September, and there will be a sightseeing journey across Hong Kong Island later in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Tramways, which has partnered with the airline, said the collaboration will attract more tourists from Taiwan to visit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nixon Cheung, the tram operator's head of commercial and brand, said the public transport firm has seen a surge in passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have a great rebound during the past years, especially when we have many free ride days, that catered to a lot of customers, especially tourists flying from all over the world," he said.

    Two dead dolphins found on Pui O Beach

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ocean Park Conservation Foundation on Thursday said it had retrieved the carcasses of two dolphins from Pui O Beach on Lantau, to try to find out why they died.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The foundation said one of the dolphins was a newborn, while the other was a severely decomposed adult of 2.4 metres in length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation urged people to report any stranded dolphins or whales to the 1823 government hotline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also called on people not to use shampoos or body washes while on boats, to prevent ocean pollution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s Assistant Scientific Manager, Dr Edgar Leung, estimated that the two Chinese white dolphins died over a week ago. He added that based on past experience, it will be almost impossible to find out the cause of their deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since 2006… we have investigated over 600 cetacean stranding cases altogether. However, most of the carcasses were found severely decomposed, like these two cases. Therefore, the cause of death is hard to determine. Only 10 percent of them can be addressed,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said possible causes of death include entanglement in fish nets or a bacterial infection. He said a necropsy will be carried out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Dolphin Conservation Society, Taison Chang, also said it will be very difficult to determine the cause of the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because mainly of the condition of the decomposed body. Most of the time, dead bodies recovered are very decomposed. So even if there is like a cut by a fishing line or a cut by propellers of a boat, the decomposed part, the body tissue, can easily mask the injury," he said.

    More measures for non-Chinese people on the way: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said more measures are on the way to make life easier for non-Chinese people in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came days after Beijing's move to allow non-Chinese permanent residents of the SAR to apply for a five-year mainland travel permit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the China Conference, hosted by the South China Morning Post, Lee hailed the new arrangement as a groundbreaking policy development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is actually a big policy breakthrough. The first step I have done to create convenience for non-Chinese friends in Hong Kong is that for any staff of a company set up in Hong Kong, there has been a fast-track procedure for them to apply for a visa to visit mainland China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So that is step one, and now we have step two, and there will be more steps coming. I hope I will deliver more to you in due course."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the measures underline Hong Kong's unique advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle, attracting companies and professionals to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong will continue to strengthen its competitiveness and role as a gateway between the mainland and global markets.

    Legco passes bill to reform social worker board

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco has passed a bill that the government says will get the Social Workers Registration Board back on the right track.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill to reform the Social Workers Registration Board, increasing the number of government-appointed members.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The board will be expanded from 15 to 27 members, with the number of appointees rising from eight to 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All members will be required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new law also stipulates that social workers who are convicted of a national security offence will be permanently stripped of their licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All lawmakers who spoke on the bill supported it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB chairman Gary Chan said reforming the composition of the board will ensure that different voices within the sector are properly represented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the changes have righted some wrongs, and the bill's passage shows Legco wants the sector to start afresh and return to providing professional services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Welfare Secretary Chris Sun thanked lawmakers for supporting the bill, saying the legal changes will allow the board to get back on the right track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe with the strengthened composition of the board, it will encourage more young people to study social work and be a social worker. With a broadened board, it will provide better protection and certainty to the profession," he told reporters.

  <br/>
  "We believe [the new board] will strengthen the professional development of the whole profession as well as strengthen its role to ensure national [security]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past three weeks, all but one of the existing elected board members resigned, including former chairman Ng Yut-ming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said there is no need to hold by-elections for their seats, because they left with less than a year of their terms remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new law will be gazetted on Friday, when an oath-taking ceremony will take place and the list of appointed members will be announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that he hopes the new board can quickly review the members of its disciplinary committee panel, as well as the social worker code of practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said it should set up a mechanism to ensure the prompt handling of social worker registration for those who have committed serious crimes such as national security offences, as well as a framework for the continuous development of the profession.

 Customs officers say they have charged a 27-year-old man with trafficking dangerous drugs after a tip-off from their Australian counterparts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Between them, authorities in the two places seized 13.5 kilogrammes of methamphetamine and six kilogrammes of cocaine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drugs, with a combined street value of HK$12 million, were being sent from the SAR to Australia inside stone statues, SAR officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police in Perth arrested a 17-year-old boy, while the Hong Kong arrest was made in Tsim Sha Tsui on June 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Earlier in June, the Australian enforcers have notified us that they intercepted an air cargo shipment from Hong Kong to Australia. The shipment was declared as a collection of stone statues. The statues were found to conceal around six kilogrammes of suspected cocaine. Customs subsequently took over the investigation,” said investigator Chris Kwan from the department's drug investigation bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We swiftly identified three more shipments that were about to be sent from Hong Kong to Australia. They were also declared as stone statues or Feng Shui decorations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said officers discovered a unit in a Tsim Sha Tsui commercial building where drugs were being concealed in statues and decorations before being smuggled to other locations.

    PolyU plans to apply for Chang'e-6 soil samples

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University on Wednesday said it is planning to apply for lunar samples from the Chang’e-6 space mission.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The spacecraft returned on June 25, bringing back the first samples ever collected from the lunar face that can’t be seen from Earth. PolyU developed a device to collect the samples.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university previously acquired lunar soil samples collected in the Chang’e-5 mission from the China National Space Administration, including a 400 mg surface sample and a 42.6 mg deep drill sample.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Yung Kai-leung, who heads the university’s Research Centre for Deep Space Explorations, said such samples are hard to come by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The lunar regolith is very very precious. Even if you are able to get 400 milligrammes, even for one crystal or one particle of the lunar regolith, we will be able to actually tell a lot of stories from there,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung said the team is eager to compare soil samples from both sides of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That actually has a lot of significance. Because we can see the front side, meaning that side is actually protected by Earth, especially from the magnetic field and the Earth’s gravity,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But on the far side, it’s open to the bombardment of all the different meteorites as well as solar winds, direct effect from the solar system.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team will also look into finding water in moon soil by analysing its content and formation process.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that it is proactively promoting the development of a low-altitude economy on various fronts and a senior official will be appointed to coordinate these efforts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The use of low-altitude airspace has become a prominent topic of discussion on the mainland, with the emergence of delivery drones, flying taxis and other aircraft for emergency services and agriculture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing sees the development of a low-altitude economy as one of the new engines of growth, and the SAR government has been repeatedly urged to catch up with the national development strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco meeting, Deputy Secretary for Transport and Logistics Liu Chun-san told lawmakers that his bureau will work with the Civil Aviation Department to examine issues such as aviation safety and airspace management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of air safety, the government will take a gradual approach to start from the near to the far and from the light to the heavy to gradually widen and enrich the application scenarios of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On management of low altitude airspace, with public interest in mind, the aerial routes of AAM should be far away from populated areas. There should be a safe distance with buildings and structures and the flights should not affect the civil aircraft taking off and landing at the airport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu said new large-scale development projects, such as the Northern Metropolis and the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands, can provide enough open space, community and commercial land to meet the infrastructure needs of a low-altitude economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it has approved three visa applications under the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES) since its launch in March.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The scheme received about 340 applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of Immigration Benson Kwok said the authorities are exploring more opportunities to boost business travel convenience in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe the New CIES will bring new vitality and opportunities to Hong Kong. The Immigration Department will continue to collaborate closely with InvestHK to create an even more business-friendly environment in Hong Kong," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alpha Lau, director-general of InvestHK, said the government will continue strengthening Hong Kong as a business hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The New CIES brings a vast pool of talents to Hong Kong, attracting successful businessmen and innovative entrepreneurs, and with current application numbers an expected investment of over HK$10 billion to enhance the developmental strengths of Hong Kong's asset and wealth management industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said 80 applicants have been granted a visitor visa at this stage, to allow them to stay in Hong Kong to make investments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants are required to invest a minimum of HK$30 million in the SAR's tech and innovation sectors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of a review committee set up to look at the operations of public hospitals following a series of blunders said on Wednesday that there doesn't appear to be a clear mechanism in place to respond to incidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "If an accident involves human factors, such as individual healthcare personnel not following guidelines, it raises questions about how to establish a fair assessment mechanism," Tim Pang from the Society for Community Organisation said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, if it does not necessarily involve human factors, it may be related to the overall quality supervision of services or the formulation of procedural systems. The responsibility seems to fall on the management level, as they are responsible for establishing these procedures and measures. Should they be held accountable? How should they be held accountable? It seems that there is currently no clear mechanism in place to address these issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority committee is chaired by Fok Tai-fai, a paediatrician and former dean of Chinese University's medical faculty. It has seven members, including medical sector lawmaker David Lam and former head of the Urban Renewal Authority Daniel Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee is to review existing mechanisms on monitoring performance, systems to manage risk and accountability, as well as incident response policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will submit recommendations to the authority's governing board within three months.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kowloon City district councillor Rizwan Ullah says the new mainland travel card announced by the central authorities is good news for the ethnic minority community in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The permit allows non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents to have visa-free access to the mainland, with China Travel Service issuing the permits from July 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that before the arrangement, it was a challenge for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents to obtain a mainland visa, but now it is simply an online application that can be completed in under 10 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First you go online and submit the documents, second phase is a preliminary screening by the authorities and third you go to the centre and submit the documents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah also said that the new card will encourage some to grow their business in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of business individuals and traders who are Pakistani, Indian and Nepali nationals in Hong Kong who can now seize this opportunity to expand their business in the mainland."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that ethnic minority residents also see the new card as "recognition of their contributions to the country".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority on Tuesday announced the list of appointees for a committee reviewing its governance and operations, following a spate of incidents at public hospitals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The committee is chaired by Fok Tai-fai, a paediatrician and former dean of the Chinese University's medical faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four of the seven remaining members are doctors, including medical sector lawmaker David Lam. They are joined by Tim Pang - an advocate for patients' rights - and Daniel Lam, former head of the Urban Renewal Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee will review existing mechanisms to monitor performance, systems to manage risk and accountability, as well as incident response policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HA expects the committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the systemic issues in public hospitals with a view to enhancing the quality of healthcare and patient safety," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee will submit recommendations to the HA's governing board within three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had earlier ordered a thorough review after a string of medical blunders and equipment failures at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This included a 50-minute power outage at Kwong Wah Hospital last month, forcing more than 20 operations to be rescheduled.

    HK Disneyland upbeat about park's prospects

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong Disneyland Resort head Michael Moriarty told lawmakers a variety of new products and events are on the way. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759969_1_20240702190033.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Tuesday said he is confident about the park's performance, citing an increase in visitors and upcoming attractions featuring Marvel comic characters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The theme park earlier announced record-breaking earnings in the first quarter of 2024, while net loss shrank 83 percent to HK$356 million in the fiscal year ending September 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council meeting, managing director Michael Moriarty told lawmakers that the park aims to roll out new events throughout the year to lure visitors to come back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this summer's Pixar celebration is a fine example of that, leveraging the popular intellectual property coming out of Inside Out," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're very much excited about the Marvel expansion, what we're doing for the 20th anniversary [of Hong Kong Disneyland], and a new attraction in between that we're in discussions with the shareholders ... I think all of those, put together, really provide a significant draw to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Doreen Kong asked if there is room to further expand the park on Lantau Island, saying it is dwarfed by other Disney resorts in the region, such as the one in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung admitted there are vacant sites at Penny's Bay, and pledged to make a decision with Hong Kong's interests in mind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have land available, but we need to work out the details with Hong Kong Disneyland to optimise its use," he replied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the upbeat figures, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien told reporters that he had reservations about the resort's financial outlook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was worrying about the capital - whether they need to come to Legco and ask for money again, because the government is paying up money for everything. The bridges, tunnel... hopefully no further (government) investment in Disney," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Disneyland has not turned in a profit since 2014, even as revenue surged 156 percent to HK$5.7 billion in the last fiscal year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales dropped by 11.5 percent in May compared with the same month last year, extending a losing streak to three months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that sales slid to HK$30.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drop came after a 14.7 percent fall in April and a 7 percent decrease in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government blamed the latest slump on changes in spending patterns of visitors and residents, as well as the strength of the Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said a recent increase in duty-free allowances for mainland visitors should help local retailers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The retail sector may still face some challenges in the near term. However, the Central Government's recently announced measures benefitting Hong Kong, including the further enhanced Individual Visit Scheme and the increase of duty-free allowance for luggage articles for mainland resident visitors, should help stimulate retail businesses," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that the authorities will continue to stimulate the local economy and market sentiment by hosting mega events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an online press call, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said retails sales are expected to continue falling in July and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that the market will remain sluggish for the second half of this year, considering the speedy business downturn, together with high rent and manpower costs," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other economic factors, such as the strong Hong Kong dollar, also pose challenges to the retail industry. The difficult situation is expected to continue for some time."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies providing services deemed "essential" could be stripped of their licence to operate if they fail to comply with planned legislation aimed at enhancing cybersecurity, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A proposed new law would cover critical infrastructure spanning eight sectors, including banks and telecommunication services, with companies in these fields required to take action to prevent cybersecurity incidents and report any attacks that take place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting, Security Secretary Chris Tang said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Communications Authority could revoke or refuse to renew a company's licence if it breaches the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For other sectors, when a corporation wishes to renew its licence, we will report its work on protecting computer systems of critical infrastructure to related bodies," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe the related bodies will make considerations on whether to renew or revoke one's licence based on the seriousness of an incident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether broadcasters would be included in the list of essential services, Tang said a decision would be made once the legislation takes effect.

    Planning board urged to reject technopole plan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environmental groups on Tuesday urged the Town Planning Board to reject a government plan to build a technology hub at the site of fish ponds in the New Territories, warning it would cause damage to hundreds of hectares of wetland conservation area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their petition came as the board began a second meeting on the proposed San Tin Technopole plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Zimmerman, chief executive officer of Designing Hong Kong, was among those who submitted a petition letter to the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want the government to redraw the boundaries of the technopole and to respect the boundaries of the wetland conservation area and buffer area. It is a very simple request. These boundaries have been here for a long time, for a very good reason,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zimmerman said the area in question is of important significance to migratory birds and is an asset that belongs to citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Conservation Officer at the Hong Kong Birdwatching Society Wong Suet-mei urged the board to reconsider the government's plan to use wetland conservation area for the hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The planning this time relies very much on a just approved Environmental Impact Assessment, but we think the report is the worst one ever conducted in the past 30 years, ever since there are conservation policies in place. We hope the board can examine the assessment under proper circumstances,” Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former observatory chief Lam Chiu-ying, who also attended the meeting, said the development proposal would undermine Hong Kong’s contributions to China’s environmental conservation policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The filling of fish ponds... will make Hong Kong the underperformer in protecting the ecosystem in China. Is the technopole necessary? Are there any alternative locations for building the hub? And why is it a must to use wetland?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government says much of the land to be used for the technopole is of low ecological value and it will seek to avoid affecting the habitats and flight corridors of migratory birds as much as possible.

    InvestHK assists 322 companies in first half of 2024

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's investment promotion agency on Tuesday said it assisted 322 companies to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong in the first half of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was 43 percent more compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  InvestHK said the companies injected over HK$38.3 billion into the economy and created more than 3,500 jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the Director-General of Investment Promotion, Alpha Lau, said these companies are from 33 economies, with nearly half from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the mainland enterprises, over the past years, the percentage had always been hovering around 35 percent, because Hong Kong is an international city that's a springboard into the rest of the world," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are unlike any other Chinese city, which is why even Chinese enterprises have to come to Hong Kong. Most of them do anyway, to set up the first stepping stone or international headquarters to go outside of China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-four percent of the 322 firms helped so far this year are from the financial services and FinTech sectors, while 19 percent are from the innovation and technology industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau also said InvestHK is currently scrutinising 310 applications received since March for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, which aims to attract high-net-worth individuals to Hong Kong. She said she expects the scheme to bring in investments exceeding HK$9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, Lau said the agency will focus its promotional efforts in the coming months on the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as in the Middle East and North Africa.

 A new permit for non-Chinese permanent residents of Hong Kong to travel to the mainland without a visa is proving to be very popular, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China Travel Service will issue the permits from July 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee described Beijing's move as a breakthrough that will "take good care" of foreign residents of the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we're going to improve the arrangements with the China Travel Service. We'll listen to views so as to optimise the arrangements," the CE said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District councillor and deputy school head Rizwan Ullah said ethnic minority residents often find the application process for travel visas to be complicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new card will make it more convenient for students to go on study trips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of InvestHK, Alpha Lau, said foreign residents are hailing the new arrangement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, in one day, I've already gotten a lot of very positive feedback from foreign chambers to say how wonderful the Hong Kong government is for doing this, for facilitating this together with the central government," she told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Grace Citizen’s young number nine, Li Hau-yi, is a rising star in women’s football in Hong Kong. She dreams of representing the SAR, but ironically, her path to success may first take her away from the city, where she can best develop her game by competing against elite players in a professional league.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to be someone who contributes to Hong Kong’s football scene. My goal is to secure a ‘first eleven’ spot on the Hong Kong team. I also hope to be a role model for others; someone people are proud to have as a friend, or a family member," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To make the next step, the 17-year-old will have to take a break from her studies to move to a side in the Chinese Super League because Hong Kong does not have a professional women’s league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said this way, she can concentrate on the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think being a footballer in Hong Kong, in my experience, is quite difficult," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I go to school in the morning at eight, and then practise until around nine or ten in the evening. Sometimes I arrive home at eleven before having to wake up early again the next day," she said, describing her average day in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   <br/>
   Li’s teammate, Iris Kwok, 30, knows a thing or two about the challenges of playing professionally outside of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok played in the territory’s amateur and semi-professional leagues for two decades before Spanish second-tier side Rayo Vallecano added her to their roster in March. Kwok said the transition was tough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The playing-level is high there, whether that is the technique or physicality, so it took a bit of time to adapt. The players are very professional and they come really prepared. Their technique is incredible and their speed is fast so, after training with them, I feel like I have improved a lot."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But joining the squad partway through the season meant Kwok was unable to register with the Spanish league, and so did not feature for the Vallecano first team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_4_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Kwok’s coach at Citizen, Leung Kwun-chung, said he was not surprised his former captain caught the eye of an overseas side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leung noted that the path Kwok has gone down is one of the things that could benefit local football in the long term, adding that Kwok’s experience abroad had inspired her teammates at Citizen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I'm trying to provide more chances for the players to play at the highest level. And once they come back, supposedly the general standard, the club standard, or the level of Hong Kong will be increased."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_6_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
     <div class="image-title-1">
      <span>
      </span>
     </div>
     <br/>
     Leung has been coaching Grace Citizen for two years, but he is better known for his achievements as a player. The defender and midfielder has eleven caps for the Hong Kong men's international team, and has a Premier League trophy to his name with local side Tai Po.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, as a coach, he quickly learnt that the women's game is very different; with precious few resources, but plenty of potential.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Men's football in Hong Kong, maybe they've already got the model…You cannot change too much,” he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "But the women's world is totally different. Maybe they’ve just started, it’s just the beginning. We don't have the professional league, and maybe one of the advantages of that is we don't have any limitations."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_8_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
      <div class="image-title-1">
       <span>
       </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Leung said he is trying to make the most of the resources he has at his disposal. That means he is boosting social media exposure, and trying to fill gaps in staffing to maximise players’ potential.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And all this, he hopes, will raise the profile of women’s football in the SAR and attract more money and resources to the sport.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Coach Leung's philosophy at Grace Citizen is having a knock-on effect among the younger members of his squad, one that is epitomised by Li.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "I am so keen to go abroad, whenever more people are sent out, it rouses my determination, which makes me work harder, and believe in myself more.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong should capitalise on the measures announced by Beijing in supporting the local economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said an increase in duty-free allowance for mainland residents was something that was not easy to come by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Monday, the amount was tripled from 5,000 to 15,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This has been achieved after a lot of efforts by different ministries and authorities of the central government," Lee told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's important that we make good use of the new arrangement so that the benefits will be realised to its best potential."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said officials will keep reviewing different measures and discuss with the central authorities ways to enhance Hong Kong's economic development and tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said as Hong Kong's economy is in a transitional phase, people have to accept that and find ways to improve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can't rest on our own laurels to just think of present success or past successes... So I urge everybody to think of innovative ways to capitalise on the new measures that have been offered to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that various measures in support of Hong Kong can bring major synergy effects.

    Officials to go to Sichuan to discuss panda delivery

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said authorities will head to Sichuan to discuss arrangements for Hong Kong to receive two pandas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was announced on July 1 that the central government will send the pandas to the SAR as a gift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he hopes the pandas will arrive within a few months, and he believes they will attract tourists from around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether there will be a naming contest for the pandas, Lee said the government will first go to Sichuan to discuss details of the arrangement with mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the important thing is ensure that the arrangement for the giant pandas' arrival will be smooth and safe because I know that there will be quarantine requirements and all the necessary procedures need to be followed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have experience of receiving the gifts of giant pandas from central authorities, and Ocean Park has been doing an excellent job in ensuring that they are well taken care of."

    'Soft opening would have eased gridlock on new link'

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759874_1_20240702092541.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link should have had a soft opening to reduce the mega infrastructure project's novelty factor, according to the CEO of a transport consultancy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new 24-kilometre link across the Pearl River Delta opened on Sunday but traffic was gridlocked as many drivers stopped on the bridge to take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of the congestion we are seeing at the moment, those are just novelty factors," said Alok Jai, CEO of Trans-Consult, on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And normally when we open infrastructure like that, usually you should have a soft opening - which gives people the chance to take pictures and look around and appreciate it - before you do the full opening, or proper opening, then it becomes a proper transport linkage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in the gridlock. One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain welcomed the link, saying it would take pressure off the Humen Bridge at the north of the Pearl River Delta and improve connectivity within the region. But he said he didn't think it would cut journey times between Shenzhen and Zhongshan to 30 minutes from two hours, which had been widely reported ahead of the opening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is certainly going to reduce it by 45 minutes or so. But that in itself - as far as we talk about the connectivity within the Pearl River Delta, or the Greater Bay Area - that is a significant saving in journey times," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain also said he expected the new link to take traffic away from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which is more expensive. He said Hongkongers heading to Zhongshan may opt for the new link instead of going via Zhuhai. But he said the main beneficiaries would be those living in the Shenzhen or Zhongshan areas and those using the Humen Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link consists of two bridges, two artificial islands and an under-sea tunnel.

    HKers and tourists enjoy July 1 goodies

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers and tourists enjoyed a wide range of freebies and discounts on Monday as the city celebrated July 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Many took advantage of the free light rail and tram trips on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There happened to be a free tram service, so I feel really lucky. It shows the characteristics of Hong Kong, so I want to experience this," a mainland tourist told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really interested in its double-decker design."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man said despite the tram rides being free, there weren’t too many passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe a lot of Hong Kong people went up to the mainland during this three-day holiday, so there aren't many people... Because there are too many people crossing the border, so we tried to avoid going to the mainland during this period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other people, meanwhile, took the opportunity to visit museums for free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A girl said she enjoyed her trip to the Science Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy because I don't have to spend money for tickets. I can also go and play everywhere and I don't have to go to school," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man visited the M+ Museum at the West Kowloon Cultural District for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't come if I have to pay... I came [an hour] earlier because I can queue indoor and enjoy the air conditioning," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, not everybody was aware of the promotions on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now discovered that there're discounts and freebies offered, and these may also have contributed to the festive atmosphere. But we didn't know about that before, so more promotion may be needed," a woman said.

 Ocean Park has expressed joy over the central government’s decision to send two pandas to Hong Kong as gifts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The park’s chairman, Paulo Pong, said preparations are now underway to receive the new guests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with Ying Ying and Le Le, the new giant pandas will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China with Hong Kong citizens and tourists,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Ocean Park is deeply grateful for the trust placed in us by the central government and the HKSAR government to care for our national treasures.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A regular visitor to Ocean Park told RTHK that she’s very excited about the new pandas, saying she hopes they can be named "Economy" and "Takeoff".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am really looking forward to it. The panda frenzy can boost the economy... I hope they will have panda babies," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two tourists from the mainland, meanwhile, said they will come to Hong Kong again when the new pandas arrive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We couldn't see any pandas when we went to Sichuan. We'd be really thrilled if we can see some in Hong Kong," they said.

 A woman has been charged with murdering her husband in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday night, and she's due to appear in Kwun Tong Court on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The woman, 32, was arrested after she allegedly slashed her sleeping husband with a fruit knife in their flat at LOHAS Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man, 30, suffered multiple wounds and was certified dead at hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers earlier said they were probing the suspect's motives, noting that she had suffered from depression since giving birth around a year and a half ago.

    'Do more to ease traffic on Shenzhen-Zhongshan link'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector representatives have called on mainland officials to do more to smooth out traffic on the new Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, after commuters experienced much longer journey times than expected amid heavy congestion on its opening day on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new mega-project - which comprises two bridges, two artificial islands, and a tunnel – was supposed to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in a gridlock for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some vehicles stopped on the bridge and people were taking photos. There should have been four lanes available, but when the problem was at its peak, there were only two," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The traffic capacity was reduced by half, leading to traffic congestion. Transport departments and officers could have done better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, pointed out that it took him about five hours to reach Shenzhen from Zhongshan on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes mainland authorities will handle the issue by, for example, banning commuters from taking photos on bridges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will keep an eye on the situation for one or two more weeks. I will also see what happens this coming Saturday and Sunday," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will make decisions on tour group arrangements depending on the traffic situation, especially for those heading to the west side of the Pearl River Delta. I think we'll have to keep things flexible and people on tours should be aware of this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach operator Eternal East Bus, meanwhile, said it anticipates a 30 percent jump in passenger numbers with the opening of the new link, and will increase the frequency of buses to Zhongshan accordingly.

    Non-Chinese HK residents to get mainland travel cards

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Authorities said non-Chinese permanent residents can start applying for the mainland travel permit from July 10. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759771_1_20240701105809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing announced on Monday that non-Chinese Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents can soon apply for mainland travel permits, eliminating their need for visas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Immigration Administration said the move is to facilitate cross-border personnel exchanges, and support the integration of the two SARs into the national development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From July 10, eligible persons can apply for the permit by visiting a China Travel Service outlet in person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The permit will be valid for five years, and holders can enter the mainland multiple times during the period. They can stay up to 90 days per visit," the administration said in an online announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Permit holders will be able to cross the border through e-channels after having their fingerprints collected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they will not be allowed to work, study or engage in activities such as news gathering on the mainland. Those who intend to do so need to apply separately to relevant authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities hope the new policy will make it more convenient for personnel exchanges in areas such as businesses and investment, cultural and tourism as well as education and research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Hong Kong government welcomed the new policy, saying it will greatly enhance border clearance efficiency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee added that it demonstrates the country's care and support for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents have deep roots in Hong Kong. They have been working diligently and making significant contributions to the development of Hong Kong," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure is not limited to any nationality or industry, which fully highlights Hong Kong's unique status under 'one country, two systems' and greatly helps Hong Kong maintain its international character and diversity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that officials have been in close communication with their mainland counterparts in facilitating the flow of talent across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Austrian Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong and Macau also welcomed the arrangement, saying it saves business travellers precious time while those with family ties in the SAR can also take advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As far as I understand, [the arrangement] even applies for children," chairman Wilhelm Brauner said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, it makes your business travel easy, but you can even now extend it to your family and take advantage of these improved procedures to take your family to [mainland China] on a weekend - or on an extended weekend holiday - whatever you might want to do,” he added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Monday that Beijing is to send two pandas to Hong Kong as gifts, as he led top officials and political heavyweights in attending activities marking the 27th anniversary of SAR Establishment Day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At 8am, the CE and more than a hundred guests attended the flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those in attendance were the director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, former Chief Executives Donald Tsang, CY Leung and Carrie Lam, as well as Chief Justice Andrew Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the national and SAR flags were being raised, the guests all stood solemnly facing them while the national anthem was being played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disciplined forces, such as the Government Flying Service and Fire Services Department, gave their salute at Victoria Harbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the brief ceremony outdoors, the guests headed to a reception inside the Convention and Exhibition Centre next door.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the reception speech, the CE announced that Beijing will be sending two pandas to Hong Kong, with the pair being the fifth and sixth pandas to live in Ocean Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I sincerely thank the central government's care and support for the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The officials took up my proposal to send the pandas to Hong Kong as gifts. We are immediately starting preparations to receive them in a few months, and they'll bring us joy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said this is just the first of many good news to come for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive also spoke about the work of the SAR government over the past year, including enacting homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law, as well as attracting more skilled workers to come to Hong Kong.

    Shenzhen-Zhongshan link officially opens

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Sunday welcomed the opening of a road link that spans the Pearl River Delta and connects Shenzhen with Zhongshan, saying that it helps to promote market integration in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, which opened on Sunday afternoon, is expected to cut the journey time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, traffic jams at both ends of the link marred the first day of operation, and some people complained the journey took much longer than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi said it's necessary to ensure the link is safe and smooth, and that it will help integrate the eastern and western sides of the Pearl River Delta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said he expects it to be a popular tourist spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One out of two enquiries have been asking about the Shenzhen-Zhongshan link for single-day or multi-day tour groups. Customers hope to go to Zhongshan, Shunde or Gudou and spend three days there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man travelling to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong by tour bus said he now expects the journey to be more convenient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I travelled to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong before, I had to go via Shenzhen Bay and Humen. It took me five-and-a-half hours. I want to see whether taking the link will cut my journey time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A restaurant manager in Zhongshan said he expects business to increase after the opening of the transport link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong tour groups contribute to half of our sales for group dining. After the opening of the link, many travel agencies, which didn't previously partner with us, also came to our restaurant to have a look at the environment and the food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The link is 24 kilometres in length and consists of two bridges, two artificial islands, and a two-way, eight-lane tunnel.

 The Chief Executive, John Lee, on Sunday said Hong Kong currently has more opportunities than challenges, and the city has to grasp the chance to create more achievements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video marking two years of the current administration, Lee said now is the time for Hong Kong to advance from stability to prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are more opportunities than challenges. Hong Kong society is generally safe and stable now, so it's the best time for development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be innovative while having bottom-line thinking. We have to make timely and appropriate measures according to local conditions when formulating policies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that there were still external challenges, but that Hong Kong would make best use of its advantages.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they had arrested a 32-year-old woman on suspicion of murder after her 30-year-old husband was found dead from a knife wound at a flat in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they had received a report about the incident from the suspect's father-in-law at 11.50 pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police rushed to the scene and found the man on the sofa with injuries to his neck. He was sent to Tseung Kwan O Hospital in an unconscious state, where he was declared dead just after 12.30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, assistant district commander Tsang Chun-kit said initial enquiries suggested the woman may have been suffering from depression after giving birth to her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to thoroughly investigate her motive. The mental state of the suspect is one of the key areas that our investigation will focus on. This is because the suspect experienced significant depression after giving birth to her son. She had sought regular treatment from a private doctor," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the couple had been married for five years and had no apparent financial problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that at the time of the incident, their one-and-a-half-year-old son was being taken care of by his paternal grandfather.

    Time for HK to step out of defensive stance, says FS

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, on Sunday said it's time for Hong Kong to take a step forward, after being in a defensive position over the past few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Chan said the city had been safeguarding its financial security and economy since 2019 due to the social unrest and the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the government is working to boost the economy, despite the presence of external challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the short term, we are holding many mega events and inviting people to visit Hong Kong. We hope to make our city more lively and prosperous. After the pandemic, fewer people are coming here, and Western countries may have misunderstandings about Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But businesses, who have come in recent months, feel positive about Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said some countries had criticised but they had been proved wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some said Hong Kong is no longer a financial centre, and that there was an outflow of capital. But if we look at the data, when they were making these slanders in 2023, we still saw a net capital inflow," he said.

    MTR fare rise of 3.09 percent kicks in

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fares on the MTR rose by 3.09 percent on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The MTR had initially sought 3.2 percent but the government's affordability cap - which is based on the median monthly household income - limited the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase means that an adult passenger using an Octopus card to make the long journey between Tung Chung to Hong Kong Station will have to pay 70 cents more, bringing the total fare to HK$24.3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cushion the initial blow, the rail operator is offering a complimentary ride for passengers who make 10 trips on the rail network between July 1 and July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, this offer is only available to adult passengers who have linked their Octopus cards to the MTR Mobile app.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also excludes the Airport Express and Light Rail.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Saturday said it strongly disapproves of remarks by the US regarding the human rights situation in the city. This came after the US published its 2023 Report on International Religious Freedom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the US report was another attempt to slander the SAR under the guise of religious freedom. It accused the US of piling up false stories and fabricating narratives. It said residents of Hong Kong enjoy the right of religious freedom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also called on the US to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.

    Security chief says being a fugitive has a high cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security Chris Tang on Saturday said that the government revoked the passports of six wanted people this month to send a message that there was a high cost to being a fugitive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an interview to mark the second anniversary of the current administration, Tang said fugitives might also lose any foreign travel documents once they were no longer of use to those harbouring them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know why these people think that, 'maybe I'll still have the opportunity to travel to other places by using my refugee status as a refugee or another status.' I'm not entirely sure in this regard," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But firstly, you'll not be able to use Hong Kong SAR passports to travel; and secondly, while you may now have value because others sympathise with you - and they have granted you travel documents - you might lose those documents, when you no longer have any value. Then you won't be able to travel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The six people wanted here for alleged national security offences under homegrown national security legislation include Nathan Law, Mung Siu-tat, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng, Johnny Fok and Tony Choi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the security minister also called on Alman Chan, the wanted principal of drug rehabilitation centre Christian Zheng Sheng College, to return to Hong Kong from the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others - including Chan, who denies the allegations - were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I noticed that Alman Chan said on social media that 'Oh I did not take any funds from the college and the issue has nothing to do with me, and I'm not involved'.."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this is true, I hope he has the courage to return to Hong Kong and explain to us clearly about the whole matter. On the one hand you are running away, and on the other you are making such remarks. This has no meaning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Tang said authorities would make sure that the July 1 celebrations pass off peacefully.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on why there are now fewer protests on July 1, Tang said that, although protesting is allowed, a protest might be hijacked by people with ulterior motives so residents are choosing other options instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe Hongkongers, after going through what happened in 2019, they clearly know that - while they want to hold a peaceful protest - many people, who wish to endanger national security or Hong Kong's security, might take the opportunity to conduct acts endangering national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said Hong Kong residents know that they might be used, so they have chosen other ways to express their opinions. He also said residents might just feel the government is doing a good job.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong would grasp opportunities to innovate and transform the economy. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759582_2_20240629151414.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said that the city's 'One Country, Two Systems' governing principle is a world-recognised success, and that local residents know clearly that there's no change in the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng was speaking at a celebratory event in Victoria Park ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 27 years, which areas in Hong Kong have changed and which have not? While outsiders can pretend not to know, local residents clearly know that there's no change to the city's governing principle," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can clearly see that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle has not changed. The city's high degree of autonomy has not changed, its legal environment has not changed, the business environment has not changed, democracy and freedom have not changed, the way people live their lives has not changed, the city's international character has not changed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And at the same time, we can see all the positive changes in the city since the return to the Motherland. Hong Kong has moved from colonial rule to being the 'apple of the country's eye'," he added, hinting that more policies benefiting the SAR will come along the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also speaking at the event, Chief Executive John Lee again noted that Hong Kong will go all out to boost the economy, in spite of challenges that the SAR might face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is now undergoing economic transformation and it will face different new challenges. But Hong Kong people have always been able to adapt," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So as long as we grasp new opportunities, innovate for change, and strive to be stronger in our various posts... we'll surely reach more glorious achievements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city's top leader also reviewed his work over the past two years via a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include the enactment of the Article 23 legislation, the rolling out of light public housing, efforts to shorten the waiting time for the public housing, the removal of the property cooling measures, as well as the hosting of events to spur economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described his administration as a boat navigating the winds and tides, adding that many policies are gradually bearing fruit.

    Retail sector moves to cater for new allowances
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association says that the increased allowances will offer a boost to the retail industry. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759565_1_20240629121734.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse, said on Saturday that the industry will aim to offer more products that cater for the new duty-free shopping allowances announced by Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland shoppers heading back to the mainland will see their allowances more than double to 12,000 yuan from 5,000 yuan when returning from Hong Kong and Macau at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yau Tse said that while the increased allowances did not match the annual 100,000 yuan duty-free shopping allowances in the mainland province of Hainan, it's hard to compare the two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [duty-free] system in Hainan island is really different from that in Hong Kong. There are different supporting systems for Hainan to achieve such [a quota], as it has real-name systems to keep track of how many things a customer buys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In addition, the duty-free sales in Hainan are monopolised by one group. In other words, it is much simpler to manage a system within one single group, whereas in Hong Kong, we have so many retailers, all of which are duty-free. So how can we set up one system with them all together? It is challenging..."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Tommy Cheung said that the increase was a gift from Beijing ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also urged the government to keep lobbying for allowance increases and an expansion of the multiple-entry limits for mainland visitors.

 The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board, Ng Yut-ming, has resigned amid a government plan to reform the statutory body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the board's website, Ng's tenure in office ended on Friday, following the earlier departure of six other members: Toby Ho, Grace Wong, Chan Kwok-bong, Adino Chung, Phyllis Luk and Lam Chiu-wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means only one elected member, Oscar Lai, remains on the board. The three-year term for the current board is set to expire in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to start the second reading of a government bill aimed at revamping the body next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill proposes increasing the number of appointed members from six to 17, while elected members will remain unchanged at eight.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Saturday said the government will adjust fees for Accident and Emergency departments, based on factors such as public affordability and social acceptance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, he said the financial burden on patients suffering from major illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, could be huge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo told reporters that officials are mulling a cap on medical fees paid by severely ill patients and increasing subsidies for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Considering the major illnesses, a very common example these days will be patients with cancer. It's actually a major burden for the patient and for the family as well. Because with the advance in healthcare, especially in cancer treatment, some of these medications can be very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though most of us believe that we are healthy and want ourselves to be healthy... One day we may have a major illness like cancer or a stroke and we want to ensure that the current healthcare system in Hong Kong can provide a safety net for these people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lo said an independent committee set up by the Hospital Authority (HA) to review a spate of medical blunders comprises members from various backgrounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister said the list of committee members, which includes patient organisations, people with experience in managing medical systems and handling medical equipment, will be announced shortly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has ordered a comprehensive and systemic review at the HA after a series of medical incidents and issues with equipment at public hospitals.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The departure of more members from a social worker regulator would not affect its operation, according to Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, after six of them had left amid a looming reform of the statutory body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Social Workers Registration Board's website, Toby Ho and Grace Wong's terms ended on Thursday. Four others - Chan Kwok-bong, Adino Chung, Phyllis Luk and Lam Chiu-wan - also left earlier this month, leaving only two elected members behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I noticed that several elected members chose to resign. This was their own decision," the labour chief told reporters on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new amendment bill is very clear. Even if members resign, it will not affect the board's operation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development came as lawmakers are set to start a second reading of a government bill aimed at revamping the regulator. It proposes increasing the number of appointed members from six to 17, while elected members will remain unchanged at eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new body can also promptly disqualify social workers convicted of serious offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the Legislative Council passes the amendment bill on July 3, we plan to gazette it on July 5 and the old registration board will then cease to operate," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sector, society, and the government all hope that it can be a seamless transition. To do that, we need to appoint members to the board as soon as the bill is gazetted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also defended the administration's decision to inform board members in advance that they have to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR on July 5, describing it as a "responsible" move.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday warned of potential traffic jams at boundary checkpoints near the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, as scores of travellers are expected to head north for the July 1 long weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently SAR motorists planning to travel to Macau or Zhuhai must make reservations in advance. All northbound slots for Saturday have been snapped up, while limited places are available for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have been urged to address bottlenecks near the Zhuhai checkpoint, after travellers heading back to the SAR were stuck for hours on Tuen Mun Festival earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it has installed cameras so that people can check out the traffic condition at the Hong Kong port's vehicle clearance plaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It anticipates northbound traffic to peak on Saturday, while most will return on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The department will closely monitor the traffic conditions at all ports, and strengthen the dissemination of the latest traffic information to citizens who use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to travel between the three places," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Motorists have been urged to plan their return trip ahead, and travel in off-peak hours "as far as possible".

    Mixed reactions to increase in duty-free allowance

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some mainland tourists say they hope the duty-free allowance can be increased further. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759482_1_20240628175924.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There have been mixed reactions to an increase in the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau, with some welcoming the move and others saying it doesn't go far enough.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Beijing announced that it will increase the allowance from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Tsim Sha Tsui, a mainland tourist said he hopes to see the allowance increased further because he normally spends around 100,000 yuan in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope it can be raised to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, because women’s bags usually cost around that. Also, large jewellery and cosmetics items almost always cost more than ten thousand dollars," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Central, a visitor from Shenzhen said he will spend more in the SAR after the measure takes effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the original limit of 5,000 yuan is not enough because many electronic products cost more than 5,000 yuan... This adjustment will greatly stimulate mainland consumers' purchasing power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shanghai tourist said the increase won't make a difference to him, because he's only in Hong Kong to watch a concert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't really affect me because I don't buy much in Hong Kong. And now prices in Hong Kong are probably similar to the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Retail Management Association said the measure is an important step forward and it hopes the SAR government will continue to pay attention to the needs and development of the industry.

 A new promenade was opened in Kennedy Town on Friday, with officials touting it as an excellent area for people to take photos of Victoria Harbour and the Tsing Ma Bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony, Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said the 280-metre-long promenade connecting Cadogan Street and Sai Ning Street provides more space for events, and will attract visitors to the neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that this new promenade will become an excellent resting place where everyone can come to the seaside for walks and picnics with family and friends. Organisers can also hold various youth activities, exhibitions and markets here to make the atmosphere more harmonious and to make the economy more prosperous in the coming days," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Central and Western District Office will also utilise the space to hold more activities to add life and vitality to the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said the Cadogan Street Promenade will be accessible 24 hours a day and is equipped with shaded seating areas.

 Competition climbing only made its debut at the last Olympics in Tokyo, and the chances of Hong Kong climbers making it to Paris this summer are slim.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, home-grown climber Shoji Chan told RTHK he's taking things in his stride, and believes he will eventually make it to the Olympics one day.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official has reiterated the central government's commitment to maintaining the "One Country, Two Systems" governing principle for Hong Kong, while urging the city to capitalise on its unique advantages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, the director of Beijing's liaison office, on Friday described the territory's prosperity and stability as "rock solid", and said the rule of law, business environment, as well as democracy and freedom in the SAR, remain unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Shortly after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration 40 years ago, British-Hong Kong authorities unilaterally made changes to many of their promises. The last governor, Chris Patten, arbitrarily laid 'political landmines' for Hong Kong," Zheng told a Legislative Council luncheon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the central government's commitment has never changed, and it has offered extreme care for Hong Kong.".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told lawmakers that the city has "risen from the ashes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The central government fully supports Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is rapidly advancing from stability to prosperity. The biggest change is that Hong Kong has transformed from a humiliating colony run by outsiders to the apple of the country's eye," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong serves as the bridge for the world to understand China, enter China, and shake hands with China... [Integrating into the country] will not marginalise Hong Kong, or even 'mainlandise' the city. Instead, it will further strengthen Hong Kong's status and advantages, and have better achievements."

 Politicians and industry representatives on Friday welcomed Beijing's move to raise the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities announced that the limit will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.

  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, told reporters that the move will boost the city's retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that with this initiative, tourists from the mainland can shop more freely and it can benefit our various industries, especially the retail industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that local authorities have to do their part to make the SAR a more attractive place for tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the two sessions in Beijing in March, delegates to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) signed a petition asking for the duty-free allowance to be increased to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, a CPPCC Standing Committee member, said the increase announced is a "good beginning", even though it's lower than the amount proposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This arrangement is exclusive. This arrangement is fair to both parties, and this arrangement can be adjusted going forward. And at the same time, it will be a boost to our retail industry and to our tourism industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation also welcomed Beijing's move, adding that the SAR government can work with malls to promote Hong Kong as a "shopping paradise".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, said it will hand out 500,000 sets of offers worth more than HK$100 million to overnight visitors to Hong Kong starting from July 11, including sightseeing, transport, dining and consumption discounts.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city's government-owned investment vehicle aims to forge a more competitive tech-innovation ecosystem in the SAR, as he highlighted its differences with Singapore's sovereign investment arm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has been considered by some as a local version of Temasek in Singapore, Chan said the two bodies are “completely different” in an interview marking two years of the current administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s like comparing apples and oranges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two goals of the HKIC are to generate appropriate financial returns, and to help boost the innovation and technology industries and create a local ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Other than conducting its own investments, a more important [function of the firm] is that it will serve as a guide for other long-term and sovereign wealth funds and to invest in certain sectors together... to create a domino effect and attract HK$100 billion, or HK$200 billion or even HK$300 billion,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the government investment vehicle, which was set up two years ago and manages some HK$62 billion in assets, is still operating at an initial stage with only two deals signed so far, and authorities will reveal more details regarding projects with the release of its yearly report later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKIC signed deals with tech firms SmartMore and BioMap InnoHub earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the local property market, Chan said it remains stable despite a drop in prices in May, snapping a two-month increase following the removal of all cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid fluctuations in the residential property prices because they're affected by multiple factors, including interest rates as well as supply and demand. They're also affected by how people perceive the outlook of the property market and the city’s economic situation, job market, etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe the most important thing for the government is to maintain a healthy development of the property market, in other words, not to have major fluctuations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary added the government will keep ramping up land supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also expressed confidence towards the SAR economy in the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the economy was in its recovery stage in the first six months of 2024 and was still facing challenges, a series of mega events in the next six months will further boost local economic activity.
