<div class="itemFullText">
 Equestrian athlete Natasha Tse left for Britain on Monday for two final weeks of training ahead of the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Growing up with cerebral palsy, which hinders movement and muscle control, Tse embraced horse-riding at a young age of four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making her Paralympic debut in London at just 15, the veteran is gearing up for her fourth Games in early September, where she'll be competing in the individual para dressage event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this time, Tse is bringing two “horses”. Check out our video to find out why.

    Lower tax for companies sponsoring athletes: DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called on the government to offer tax concessions to businesses that sponsor local athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Cheng, who is also the vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), explained the number of companies sponsoring athletes was limited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are a lot of big companies that are really interested to support all the sports events. When we're talking about the marathon, the badminton competition, they do have a title sponsor," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [number of] companies supporting the athletes [is] not a lot. So, we hope that later on in the future, the government can encourage more companies to support the athletes directly, like supporting their salary or hiring them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also urged the government to purchase broadcasting rights for the upcoming 15th National Games, the 2026 Aichi-Nagoya Asian Games in Japan as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this would make it easier for residents to follow the competitions, rally behind home-grown athletes and provide a boost to the local catering and retail sectors.

    Some toilet paper can clog sewage pipes: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that toilet rolls which hold up well in wet conditions may not break apart quickly after use and can clog sewage pipes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council said it tested 25 types of toilet paper rolls in accordance with mainland standards, comparing absorbency, strength, softness, ease of flushing and hygiene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the overall hygiene and standard of the toilet paper tested was satisfactory, but four types didn't disintegrate so well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When consumers buy toilet rolls, they need to make a choice, whether they want a tougher, stronger product to use, or to balance the implications to their toilet drains," said Consumer Council Chief Executive Gilly Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said it also found that many types of toilet paper lacked proper package labelling, omitting essential information such as the number of sheets per roll, dimensions, weight and expiry dates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It urged manufacturers to improve product labelling and to ensure that all necessary information is clearly displayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong cautioned people against stockpiling toilet rolls and reminded consumers that proper storage of toilet paper in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area is crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Toilet rolls are not vacuum packaged, so if it is put in a high humidity environment… It can easily get moist and have germs or mould,” she said.

    Sports shoe firms urged to improve product quality

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People who are unhappy with the quality or performance of a new pair of sports shoes should not be afraid to follow up with the retailer, as the consumer watchdog says there is a good chance they will be compensated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Manufacturers have also been told to do more to make sure their products live up to the increasing expectations from users, amid a steady stream of complaints against functional footwear in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 101 complaints regarding sports shoes between January and July, compared to 227 for the whole of last year, and 257 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A complainant was refunded 80 percent of the HK$1,170 he forked out for a pair of sports shoes which claimed to be waterproof, but weren't.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water began seeping into the sneakers after he wore them about five times, and the problem persisted with a second pair that the store offered free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the shoes were sent back from the factory following an inspection, the man noticed the inner rubber trim began to peel off. But the manufacturer refused to repair the defect, triggering the complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's chief executive, Gilly Wong, offered some practical tips to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You really have to examine the product very carefully when you buy it, and if there's anything wrong, you should bring it forward to the retailer very promptly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on our experience in dealing with these kinds of complaints, the manufacturers are very willing to accommodate and settle the dispute, because they want to uphold their brand reputation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also urged manufacturers to devote more resources to maintain production quality, and not to just focus on design.

 The government will hold a bus parade on Wednesday to celebrate the triumphant return of members of the Hong Kong team who took part in the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Athletes, coaches and other members of the team will set off from Sha Tin in two open-top buses and arrive at Tamar Park to receive the cheers and applause of the public along the route.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upon their arrival at the park, the athletes will participate in a sharing session with students on their Olympic experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also attend a luncheon hosted by Chief Executive John Lee at Government House at noon, ahead of a welcome home reception.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best viewing locations for the bus parade will be Tai Wai Station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier.

    Newborn pandas doing well, still fragile: Ocean Park
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Monday said the two newborn pandas were doing well, but they remain fragile and it would probably take a few weeks before they started showing signs of strength.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ocean Park chairman, Paulo Pong, said veterinary experts were working behind the scenes to help Ying Ying care for the cubs that were born last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said on RTHK the park was thankful the Sichuan panda research centre had been providing the SAR with milk to feed the cubs, because Ying Ying doesn't have enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth on the eve of her 19th birthday – the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong said the newborns have been eating and discharging well, and it would be another week or two before they grow black and white fur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mainly I think the key is how the babies eat. How much breast milk they can take in, and that they can feel the temperature from their mother - how they sleep and rest. All these are important aspects for newborn pandas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So now that we offer help artificially, on top of Ying Ying learning slowly how to care for the cubs, these things really complement each other. And we hope things will continue on smoothly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong said it could take the newborns two months before they open their eyes, and learn how to walk some four months after birth. He said the theme park would try to give timely updates on the pandas, all while not giving too much pressure to the conservation experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the park would first discuss internally how it would expand its existing facilities to house six pandas, as Beijing's gift of two more are arriving next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's time, Pong said, since it would take around two to three years for the cubs to leave Ying Ying and live on their own.

    Youngsters hit hard by customer service staff scammers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are stepping up publicity efforts against fraud after the number of deception cases in Hong Kong went up by 6.2 percent to nearly 20,000 in the first half of the year, incurring losses of HK$4.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But instead of the elderly, the force is now actively reaching out to young people after noticing a demographic shift in victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of all fraud cases between January and June, 1,605 involved victims who fell prey to swindlers claiming to be customer service representatives of online platforms such as Taobao and WeChat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That number shot up to 1,111 in July alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-fifth of those victims were aged between 18 and 29, compared with only seven percent who were 70 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's because WeChat Pay and Taobao are commonly used by young persons, and they are the tech-savvy generation," said senior superintendent Tsang Nga-sze of the Commercial Crime Bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the cases, a 50-year-old clerk lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to a swindler posing as a WeChat representative last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was told by the fraudster that he had subscribed to an insurance scheme with an annual fee of HK$70,000, and the plan would be renewed automatically if he didn't complete the cancellation process within that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the scammer's instructions over the phone, he transferred a "guarantee payment" to the swindler, in a bid to verify his identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the process, the scammer sent me some links with bank logos on it, and also [showed me] their staff card, which made me believe that the fraudster was a genuine WeChat representative," the victim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He only realised he had been conned after he was ordered to set up a virtual bank account, apply for a loan and then transfer all the money to a designated account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police warned that September and October are peak months for mainland students to get scammed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually, scammers will use the excuse that their visas have some issues because they are involved in some investigations," said superintendent Theodora Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As they are new to Hong Kong, and really want to study or work here... they will believe that they are the true officials from mainland China... and make relevant transfers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force emphasised that the public should ignore calls and messages involving money, or asking for personal details.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of trafficking and manufacturing dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man, who claimed to be jobless, was detained as part of a police raid on an industrial unit in Tsuen Wan on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing the press on Sunday, senior inspector Chan Yu-wing from the Narcotics Bureau believed the suspect received instructions remotely from a syndicate on how to manufacture drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers have also confiscated 2kg of suspected ketamine, and 6kg of raw materials, with a total street value of HK$960,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also discovered a large quantity of corrosive substances. In fact, during storage or heating, these chemicals could easily catch fire or explode," Chan warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Therefore, these drug syndicates are completely neglecting public safety. Their actions are extremely irresponsible. If members of the public or security guards in a building smell something suspicious coming from a unit, like a pungent chemical smell, they should contact the police immediately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect will appear before the West Kowloon Magistracy on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has pledged to actively consider a proposal to set up a third medical school in Hong Kong to address the shortage of healthcare professionals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event honouring doctors on Sunday, Lo said the government will bolster the training of local doctors and retain medical personnel in public hospitals to tackle the staffing shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent years, the government has allocated over HK$30 billion to fund the construction of medical training facilities at universities," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, the SAR government will continue to support the two existing medical schools by enhancing their teaching capabilities, boosting admission quotas and sources. The government will also actively consider a proposal to establish a third medical school."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently only the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong offer medical programmes in the SAR, with the schools producing a combined 590 graduates each year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Nancy Ip, told the media in February that she hoped to launch the city's third medical school by 2027.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday the city's economy is expected to improve next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a two-hour public forum in Tai Po to solicit views for the upcoming Policy Address, the SAR leader heard numerous appeals from the audience to prop up certain industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A securities worker said he had never seen so many brokerage firms shut down. While acknowledging efforts by the SAR administration to lure investment from abroad, he felt the sector has yet seen any material impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lee admitted "difficulties" and "challenges" in the current environment. He believed investors are taking a cautious approach, citing factors such as the upcoming US presidential election, the interest rate development, as well as geopolitical uncertainties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, "those bet against Hong Kong in the long run will be the first to lose", Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the global economic axis is shifting to the East. We should focus on Asean countries and the Middle East, which are the new engines for global development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader was also urged to provide more support to the cultural, sports, and tourism sectors, fresh off stellar performances by Hong Kong's Olympians at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, culture, sports and tourism have been emphasised as a whole. We have had great news recently with the birth of the twin panda cubs, while two more giant pandas are on their way as a gift from the central authorities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More consultation forums will be held in the coming weeks, before Lee delivers his third annual policy blueprint in October.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government announced on Sunday that a delegation of national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics will visit Hong Kong at the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The elite athletes will arrive in the SAR by plane on August 29. Fans will have a chance to greet them at three public events - a gala show on the evening of August 30, and two concurrent demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park Swimming Pool on the morning of August 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will depart the city on the same afternoon and make their way to Macau, where they will stay another three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also meet local athletes at the Sports Institute, and attend a reception and banquet hosted by the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Who exactly will be coming remains unknown, but the Leisure and Cultural Services Department confirmed there will be badminton and table tennis stars, as well gymnasts, divers and swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has expressed gratitude to the General Administration of Sport of China and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office for arranging the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong people will be able to share the national team's joy and triumphs, thereby strengthening their patriotic passion and national spirit, especially among the youngsters," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE noted past visits by the national team had "always been a craze", and hoped the athletes will share their journey of perseverance and success and promote the spirit of Chinese sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 5,000 tickets for the events will go on sale from 10am on Thursday. Each person can buy no more than two tickets, priced at HK$20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some seats have also been reserved for the underprivileged free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identity checks will be enforced at the door to weed out scalping activities, and the government urged spectators to arrive ahead of time.

    HK people can help in global charitable work: CY Leung

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former chief executive CY Leung said on Sunday he hopes more young people can join the country's global charitable drive, saying Hongkongers have an advantage in such work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the GX Foundation, which he set up six years ago, has been helping seven countries in three different continents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes performing surgery for some 15,000 cataract patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's now a vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said when he visited those places, the conditions reminded him of China's past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I go around these places, I see situations worse than how our country was some 40-plus years ago. The medical and public health conditions were rather bad," Leung spoke on a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we utilise the strength of our Chinese community and provide help, do something. And we've got some good results. Such initiatives also help to connect Chinese and overseas peoples."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charity now plans to provide water filtering services to needy countries, on top of educating young people about the Belt and Road Initiative and public health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hongkongers have unique advantages in joining these charitable drives for China, such as the convenience of visa-free travel with an SAR passport, and the city's role as a global aviation and logistics hub.

    URA hits back at homeowners over maintenance needs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wai Chi-sing said it is wrong for homeowners to think that they should no longer pay for maintenance works after their
buildings have been earmarked for redevelopment. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766630_1_20240818124905.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority on Sunday criticised homeowners who complained about their buildings being earmarked for redevelopment just after they had started maintenance work on their buildings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statutory body's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, said it is wrong to think that it is a waste of money to repair dilapidated structures, saying it is a matter of public safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the URA announced redevelopment plans for a tenement block in To Kwa Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The building, which is more than half a century old, was already undergoing repair works with scaffolding erected across the facade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The media cited  flat owners as saying that they'd rather not continue with the rest of the works - now that their block would most likely be knocked down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Wai reminded owners it takes quite a long time for a redevelopment project to be completed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's a maintenance need for buildings earmarked in renewal plans, or they have received mandatory inspection or repair orders from the government, the homeowners really should not delay the procedures and think that they can just wait for the URA's acquisition," he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because in the event that during the wait, a lack of repairs leads to an accident that causes injury or even death, it is possible homeowners will have to shoulder relevant legal responsibilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said if homeowners kept relevant records and receipts for the maintenance works, they would be able to apply for ex gratia reimbursements from the URA after they accept an acquisition offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He explained that redevelopment projects must be kept confidential before their launch, because they involve acquisition and compensation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A search is continuing on Lantau Island for two stray dogs who were allegedly abused by workers of the Po Lin Monastery last Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police confirmed they have arrested two men, aged 65 and 46, on suspicion of animal abuse. Both have been granted bail pending an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair, who worked as chefs at the Buddhist institution, allegedly removed the canines from the quarters, before setting them free at a remote location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monastery said it has arranged staff to look for the stay dogs near Sham Wat Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement online, it said, "the monastery has always been kind to stray dogs around Ngong Ping, providing them a shelter, arranging sterilisation, vaccination and basic medical treatment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprawling monastery on Ngong Ping is home to the Big Buddha, one of the main tourist attractions of Hong Kong.

  It is the second day in a row that the Observatory has issued the amber warning, as Hong Kong continues to be hit by heavy rain.

  The government called on members of the public to report any flooding and warned employers, contractors and workers to be aware of electrical safety at work.

    Hongkongers told to not panic about mpox outbreak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Infectious diseases expert Professor Ivan Hung says the chances of the mpox virus spreading to Hong Kong is very low. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766586_1_20240817180654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Saturday were told not to panic about the more deadly and transmissible clade 1b strain of the mpox virus, but those belonging to the high-risk groups should stay vigilant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advice from infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung came after the World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency - the highest level of alarm that can be issued by the world body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 18,737 suspected or confirmed cases of mpox were reported in Africa since the beginning of the year, including 1,200 cases in a single week, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit country, the Democratic Republic of Congo has reported 222 confirmed and 783 suspected cases, as well as 24 deaths in one week, the African Union health agency noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Hung told RTHK that the chance of the virus spreading to the SAR was very low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he urged those belonging to high-risk groups - such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, bisexuals, and laboratory workers - to get vaccinated and watch out for symptoms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include a rash, a fever, coughing, and a stuffy nose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But important, of course, is that you have to take extra precaution if you belong to the high-risk groups and also those who are immunocompromised, then of course you should be cautious and consider taking the vaccines,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong professor also urged people to avoid travelling to high-risk areas in Africa, and not to touch wild animals so as to reduce the risk of catching the viral disease. (with additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tobacco and Control Office on Saturday said it launched a crackdown on the smoking of waterpipes, also known as shishas or hookahs, in Tsim Sha Tui on Friday night, issuing 11 fixed penalty notices at one bar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers including those in plain clothes raided the bar, handing out the notices which carry a penalty of HK$1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also said the bar's operators may be prosecuted under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance, and for aiding and abetting smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tobacco and Control Office spokesman said due to deeper inhalation a waterpipe smoker usually inhales more toxins and that a typical one-hour session exposes the user to 100-to-200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also flagged the carbon monoxide poisoning risk of charcoal burning and the unhygienic smoking apparatus

 Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) chief executive Tony Choi says the institute provides the city's athletes with an overall package, which includes some financial sponsorship, but athletes are not its employees.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments come after Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary general of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, said local athletes didn't have a need to spend much as they were allocated with accommodation, training, and medical support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But online criticism continued following the SAR's success at the Paris Olympics, with athletes chiming in and saying they had to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Choi said entry-level full-time athletes get around HK$7,000 a month, so they could focus on training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSI and the athlete are not employer and employee," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But also we are including overseas training, local training, coaching support, accommodation, meals, and also education support. It's an overall package for the elite athletes... They are not our staff."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi denied that the limited subsidy provided had led to potential athletes dropping out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see many athletes dropping out... We tried our best to help, in terms of other expenses, which included study, career planning. We hope to give athletes motivation... If many potential athletes dropped out, Hong Kong wouldn't have achieved good results," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi added that "only the fittest will survive", and resources given to athletes were inevitably hinged on their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-chairman of the HKSI, Vincent Cheng, said a review on a direct subsidy scheme for local athletes will be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have to review every four years. We're going to have this review starting from September and October, and hopefully we can finish it earlier next year. We will review... especially on their subsidy support," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong saw heavy rain on Saturday morning with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning for about five-and-a-half hours until just before 11 am. There were no reports of any damage, although there was some flooding in Ma On Shan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government put out a call for the public to report any flooding and for employers, contractors, and employees to be aware of electrical safety at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rainfall comes less than a day after the Drainage Services Department outlined seven projects to cope with the increasingly frequent extreme weather conditions, with the Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok signing five contracts relating to the projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new projects follow the extreme rainstorms last September and a commitment to implement them by the Chief Executive John Lee in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include six underground flood storage tanks in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City, Shek Kip Mei, Sha Tin, Tai Po, and Kwun Tong along with drainage improvement works in those districts and in Eastern District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storage tanks, which have a total capacity of more than 200,000 cubic metres, will be at Shek Kip Mei Park, Morse Park, Hoi Bun Road Park, Argyle Street Playground, Tai Po Old Market Playground, and Sha Tin Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work will be completed in phases over the next three-and-a-half years to six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five contracts signed on Friday totalled HK$6.4 billion.

    We will ensure panda cubs' survival: Ocean Park

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Friday said it is sparing no effort to ensure the survival of the newborn giant panda twins in Hong Kong, with experts keeping a watchful eye on the cubs around the clock.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing a day after their birth, the park reassured that the twins' survival rate is higher in captivity, compared to those born in the wild.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Howard Chuk, the head of Zoological Operations and Conservation at Ocean Park, noted that experts from the mainland are also playing a role in ensuring the baby pandas’ survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the cubs are actually being handled by the experts from Wolong [National Nature Reserve]. We make sure the cubs could [reach] a more stable status," he said, adding that they hope the mother panda, Ying Ying, can raise them later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But of course, we do hope that Ying Ying can learn it and experience it, and not jeopardise her welfare management."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying gave birth to the twins on the eve of her 19th birthday – the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Ocean Park's chairman, Paulo Pong, confirmed that the new cubs will stay in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Luckily at the same time we're actually receiving two new pandas. So it's perhaps the double gold from the Olympics, perhaps it's the double bronze from the Olympics that gave us even more luck," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope this will bring great fortune to Hong Kong and we hope to continue our journey in our works of conservation and education," Pong added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Friday said he expects the public could meet the two new giant pandas gifted by the central authorities in December.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Yeung visited Sichuan where he attended a cooperation agreement signing ceremony on the arrival arrangements for the two giant pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up his visit, he said the two giant pandas are expected to arrive in the SAR by late September. But he said the pair would have to undergo one month of quarantine and that they would need another month to adapt to their new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that Ocean Park may need new facilities to accommodate giant pandas, as the city's panda Ying Ying gave birth to two cubs on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong, in the future, may have six giant pandas... Newborn giant panda babies can live in the same environment with their mum until they are two to three years old," he told reporters at the airport here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still have time. In the next one or two years, we can plan for long-term arrangements regarding the living environment of the six giant pandas."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that the two newborn giant pandas are currently in a stable condition, and that the twins would continue to stay in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Newborn giant pandas need special care because of their small size, such as in terms of their body temperature or how they take in milk," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But people don't have to worry about that. Experts from the mainland and Ocean Park are closely monitoring their situation. We are providing the most professional and the best care for the cubs."

    Job market remains stable for fifth straight month

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's labour market remains stable, with the unemployment rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive month. File photo: Xinhua" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766471_1_20240816172116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's job market remained steady, with the latest government data showing the unemployment rate at three percent between May and July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure has been unchanged since March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a government spokesperson warned the labour market could be under pressure in the short term, as changing spending habits of locals and visitors would dent consumption-related industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the jobless rate remained consistent, around 3,100 people still lost their jobs in July, joining more than 114,000 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, the labour force expanded by 8,400 to roughly 3.83 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weak domestic demand continued to weigh on consumption-related industries. The jobless rate for the retail sector worsened by 0.4 percent to 4.3 percent, while food and beverage industry hit five percent after going up three-tenths of a percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other sectors improved, notably trade and wholesale, accommodation services, transportation, insurance sector and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market "should remain tight in the near term", according to labour and welfare minister Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Statistics from the Labour Department suggest job hunters have much less choice. There were around 71,700 private-sector vacancies in July, a 31 percent decline from a year ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

 Immigration officials on Friday said they had arrested three people on suspicion of working illegally in the SAR as photographers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department said it believes the trio – a man and two women – had advertised wedding and street photography services on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they pretended to be customers and arrested the three suspects after they entered Hong Kong from the mainland as tourists.

    Make HK a hard liquor trading centre, says lawmaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB's Kennedy Wong said if Hong Kong didn't lower or scrap hard liquor duty, it would lose out to Hainan Island and Macau. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766395_1_20240816093031.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong says Hong Kong should scrap its 100 percent levy on strong alcohol so it can match the wine industry and become an international trading centre for hard liquor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Wong said the wine trade had boomed since duty was scrapped in 2008 and revenue from sales of alcohol with a strength of over 30 percent was only HK$700 million. He also said Hong Kong needs to compete with Hainan, which will be tax free by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look at this issue from a trade perspective. If we don't lower or scrap the duty we are already losing out to Macau and the surrounding areas and at the end of this year, when Hainan turns into a free trade zone, a lot of the whisky, brandy promotions - because they are all aimed at the mainland China market - they'll all move to Hainan. Hard liquor from mainland China, like the Moutai, the Wuliangyee, they won't use Hong Kong to tap the international market, they might as well use Hainan," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong had the highest liquor duty in the region with Macau only charging 10 percent. He said Hong Kong also charged more than Taiwan and Japan, although the duty here was about the same as South Korea. He said Hainan, which caters mainly to the mainland domestic tourist market, had been declared a tax free area by the State Council in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said if Hong Kong followed the same route as the wine trade here, it could be an attractive place for companies wanting to sell top-of-the range hard liquor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You scrapped the duty so a lot of aged or vintage wine moved to Hong Kong and because Hong Kong also had first-class storage facilities - and because of our close proximity to the mainland China market, which is a big, big market you know for the wine industry - a lot of wine merchants created off-shoots here including a lot of French vineyards, chateaux that I know," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think likewise for liquor: for vodka, for whisky, for brandy, for the Moutai and so on. If they all create more trading companies here and then they are willing to move some of their vintage - the nice liquor - to Hong Kong, then Hong Kong will gradually climb back to the top of the world in this particular field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month the DAB called on the Chief Executive John Lee to scrap the duty on hard liquor as part of its proposals for Lee's upcoming policy address.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda pair of Ying Ying and Le Le have finally produced babies, after they successfully mated in March this year at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After five months of pregnancy, Ying Ying gave birth to one female and one male in the small hours of Thursday. Ocean Park, where the giant panda lives, said she spent much of her time lying on the ground and twisting, and that she was in labour for more than five hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ocean Park Hong Kong is thrilled to welcome the birth of the first-ever giant panda twins in Hong Kong," the amusement park said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This birth is a true rarity, especially considering Ying Ying is the oldest giant panda on record to have successfully given birth for the first time," the park said, adding that she gave birth just one day before her 19th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both cubs are currently very fragile and need time to stabilise, especially the female cub who has a lower body temperature, weaker cries, and lower food intake after birth. Currently, both babies are under 24-hour intensive care by the park’s animal care and veterinary team, as well as experts from China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee called the birth of the panda twins a very special occasion, and thanked the nation for having gifted Ying Ying and Le Le to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Ocean Park's team for taking good care of the city's giant pandas and experts from the research centre for their support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested the driver of a tram involved in a fatal crash that killed a three-year-old girl in Western District on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tram was travelling along the eastbound track of Praya, Kennedy Town at 10.40am, officers said. But when it approached the pedestrian crossing near Des Voeux Road West, it reportedly knocked down four people who were crossing the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year-old girl was trapped under the tram and was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital in an unconscious state. She was certified dead at about 12.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A six-year-old girl, a 34-year-old woman and a 66-year-old man also sustained injuries and were sent to the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 48-year-old male driver on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and that he is currently being detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For their part, Hong Kong Tramways said that according to their preliminary understanding, the tram was operating as usual when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that they suspended the driver after the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it is very concerned about the incident and that it has asked the tramway operator to investigate it in detail and submit a report as soon as possible.

    Ridership, property earnings boost MTR profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR Corporation has proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766327_1_20240815183232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday reported an almost 45 percent rise in first-half profit compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by a strong recovery in ridership and earnings from property development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the railway firm conceded that passenger numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, even after patronage jumped more than four percent to surpass 950 million in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jacob Kam, the MTR's chief executive officer, said ridership had not been "very good" in the second quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe there are many factors that would affect patronage, the overall economic situation, consumers' patterns, they all play a role," Kam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to be cautiously optimistic as the economy recovers. We hope that patronage will improve over time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, the railway giant posted a net profit of HK$6 billion, up 44.7 percent from the same period in 2023. Total revenue rose 6.2 percent year-on-year to HK$29.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the MTR proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share, same as the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm also reversed its HK$774 million Hong Kong railway business loss into a profit of HK$415 million, while earnings from property development more than doubled to HK$1.74 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are making progress on 14 residential property projects. We will continue to explore property development opportunities along our existing and future railway lines, making optimal use of all land resources," Kam added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the firm will roll out more discounts for commuters, he said the corporation has to invest more than HK$100 billion for its projects in the future, and that it has to be prudent with its finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the railway giant is looking to tender the Tung Chung East project again after it failed to receive any bids last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively studying our projects and we are looking at our tender strategy. Subject to market conditions, we shall continue to orderly tender out our land parcels, in order to meet with the demands of Hong Kong," said David Tang, the firm’s property and international business director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for a land use study near Pak Shek Kok, the corporation said the assessment, which includes the possibility of constructing a new station along the East Rail Line, is still ongoing.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government also said measures to attract talent and import labour were having a positive impact. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766319_1_20240815175637.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population fell by 0.1 percent between mid-2023 and the middle of 2024, according to government estimates released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures by the Census and Statistics Department showed that the SAR's population slid from 7,536,100 in mid-2023, to 7,531,800 in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the territory saw a net outflow of 30,200 residents, but 44,000 one-way permit holders came to the SAR, resulting in a net inflow of 13,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the population saw a small increase in the first half of 2024 due to the introduction of various government policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Benefiting from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation, there was sizeable inflow of persons from the mainland and other places around the world to Hong Kong in the first half of 2024," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Yip, a population expert from the University of Hong Kong, said authorities had to work on retaining talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to make the people who decided to come to Hong Kong, stay in Hong Kong...I think we also have to diversify our portfolio. Not only from mainland China, we also like to attract, some foreign talent from other places too," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to make Hong Kong to be a truly cosmopolitan city, I think we do need talent to come from different places, [like] the Belt and Road countries and also Europe or the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures showed that Hong Kong saw 34,400 births last year, a five percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies, along with other proposals to promote births, was announced in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said the policies announced last October might not be reflected in the official data yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it would be very interesting to see whether there would be any substantial increase in 2024. But I think even if there is any impact, it will be quite limited," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's largest food festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Thursday, with enthusiastic bargain hunters racing inside as the doors opened at 10am sharp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some of the visitors to Food Expo said they had queued up overnight just to snap up bargains or freebies, such as ready-to-eat abalone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were looking to rediscover old favourites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We bought some Taiwanese rice flour noodles, because we went to Taiwan before so I just want my kids to try again," said a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tourists were also at the exhibition centre to sample new flavours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just got some coffee and some coffee beans. I'm from Australia so we really like coffee over there. I've got some peanut chocolate butter as well, that's really nice. Hadn't seen that before," Andrew Frank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully the customs doesn't take it away from me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vendors, on the other hand, seized the chance to learn about the preferences of local customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Illugi Gunnarsson, who distributes Icelandic farm products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very good opportunity for us to meet people from Hong Kong, really see how they react to our products. But it also gives us an opportunity to sell, of course we like that, but mainly to understand our customers," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau, meanwhile, underlined the contribution the convention and exhibition industry makes to the SAR's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The convention and exhibition industry has always been crucial to Hong Kong's economy by attracting high-spending overnight business visitors to Hong Kong, spurring economic activities and creating employment opportunities," Yau remarked at an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am glad to know that this week's fairs have gathered over 1,800 high-quality exhibitors from 28 countries and regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expo will take place until Monday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Thursday said it recorded about four million visitor arrivals in July, with about half involving overnight stays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure was a 10 percent increase on the same month last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 80 percent of July's visitors came from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said Hong Kong received about 25 million visitors in the first seven months of this year, over 50 percent more than the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the city held several events, including drone shows and pyrotechnic displays, adding that a survey of tourists found more than 90 percent believed the drone shows had enhanced their visit experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said it will organise drone shows and pyrotechnic displays during Mid-Autumn Festival, Christmas and New Year's Eve, and will stage a new year countdown fireworks performance.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association on Thursday said it welcomed a possible relaxation of the eligibility criteria for a talent attraction programme, saying it would draw more professionals to the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the moment, graduates of the world's top 100 universities are eligible to move to the SAR under the scheme. On Monday, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government is considering expanding the list of universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who founded the association, said at a press briefing that an expansion would boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This plan would give more support to Hong Kong's economy, and provide more and more entrepreneurs coming to Hong Kong and make more startups in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang also urged the government to offer more support to the children of professionals arriving in Hong Kong through the programme, saying they might encounter challenges when adapting to a new educational environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called on employers to provide housing allowances to incoming professionals due to accommodation costs in the city.

 A three-year-old girl has died after being struck by a tram and getting trapped beneath it in Western District.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The accident, which happened outside the Kennedy Town Swimming Pool on Thursday, also saw two others injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency personnel were called to the scene after a report at around 10.44am that the trio, a man and two young girls aged three and six, had been knocked down by the tram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the three-year-old was unconscious as she was rescued from underneath the vehicle. She was later pronounced dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man and the elder girl were also taken to hospital for treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tram services between Kennedy Town Terminus and Hill Road were temporarily suspended following the incident.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An IT expert on Thursday urged NGOs, schools, and hospitals to prioritise cybersecurity spending, warning they are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This advice came after the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data estimated that roughly 470,000 people's personal data was stolen in a cyberattack against Oxfam Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, the honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation and an Oxfam council member, told RTHK the council had instructed team members to notify all affected individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong explained that a key reason NGOs were prone to attacks was because of widespread work-from-home practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the pandemic because we used to work from home...We normally use a VPN to get into the office server so you can work remotely. But the problem is if you have not updated the firmware of the firewall, the VPN, the OS of the workstation server, even your antivirus or your security software, there are possibly many loopholes the hackers can attack the network and get the data from the server.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said staff awareness was lacking, noting many attacks were caused by employees tapping on suspicious web links or phishing emails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong pointed to the need for a shift in organisations’ mindsets over cybersecurity spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the past, we all thought this was just like one-off expense for security measures, but now because of so many attacks, these expenses [should] become like a regular expense, at least like a yearly expense,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So you should actually update all your servers. You have to buy subscriptions of your firewall and your security software, so that you are being properly protected, and you have to do security audits at least once a year.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments on Thursday signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in areas such as conservation and pollution control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pact was signed during a ceremony at the University of Hong Kong to mark National Ecology Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement is also aimed at stepping up joint efforts to combat climate change, ecological promotion and education, as well as preserving biodiversity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said the SAR government has always tried its best to preserve nature, as part of efforts to build a beautiful China and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always stressed the need for people to co-exist with nature and adheres to President Xi Jinping's philosophy that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively setting up the Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park in the Northern Metropolis, which would be five times larger than the current wetland park. This would enhance the biodiversity and quality of the natural habitat in the Deep Bay area," Cheuk said in a speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also enhances the environmental capacity of the Northern Metropolis and achieves the co-existence of development and conservation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk added that over the next fortnight, the administration will team up with dozens of non-governmental organisations to hold a number of activities encouraging conservation, including free ecological tours and free admission to facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Shenzhen top official on natural resources, Xu Songming, said the pact between the two governments will allow a new level of mutual governance and sharing on ecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Shenzhen has always learned from Hong Kong's good example in terms of environmental protection, calling the SAR "the world's model city" for its green and low carbon developments.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it strongly condemned remarks made by the last governor of colonial Hong Kong regarding a recent Court of Final Appeal ruling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chris Patten, writing in the Guardian newspaper, described the top court's decision to uphold the convictions of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019, as "unjust".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the verdict was "made worse" because David Neuberger, a former president of Britain's supreme court, was a party to the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SAR administration said it opposed the former governor's "malicious slandering" against the verdict and his "wanton personal vilifications" against Lord Neuberger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patten's slandering remarks were made in blatant disregard of the detailed legal analysis by the [Court of Final Appeal] in its 76-page judgement and the factual background of the relevant case," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such remarks were made for the sole purpose of exerting political pressure on the judges ... in an attempt to influence the judicial system of the [Hong Kong SAR], and were nothing but a despicable political manoeuvre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said Patten's criticisms against Neuberger were "completely groundless and unjustified personal attacks" aimed at smearing his reputation and undermining the system of non-permanent judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone has the right to express his or her views on court decisions within the boundaries permitted by the law, but no one can abusively criticise or slander judges, or make baseless allegations purely out of political motives," the spokesperson added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethnic minority pupils in Hong Kong who embarked on a mainland study tour under a new visa-free scheme said they had acquired much knowledge about the country's culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of more than 20 students from Yaumati Kaifong Association School returned to the SAR after a three-day trip across Guangdong province, designed to foster a deeper understanding of the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They learnt about martial arts, paper-cutting and Chinese calligraphy, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really enjoyed Chinese calligraphy. It's fun, beautiful and creative," said nine-year-old Dangal Zane, who learnt to write the Chinese character for "family".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now I know more about Chinese culture and arts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her schoolmate Limbu Maeson, 12, said the trip inspired him to contemplate living across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, maybe I'll decide to work there, because there are a lot of businesses," he said. "I feel like the education is more intense in China, because of the exams. Besides that, maybe it will be a good shot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maeson, just like others on the exchange tour, crossed the border using a new travel permit for permanent residents with foreign passports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time when we went to China, it took way longer and we were stressed out about what if we didn't make it," he said, adding that it only took him a minute to pass through immigration this time round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Ka-ho, a school manager who led the tour, had nothing but praise for the new travel scheme for non-Chinese SAR residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, they did not even have the chance to sign up for an exchange tour due to the lack of a permit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But that's not the case anymore. They could sign up for these tours ... so that they have more opportunities to take part in the country's development and observe the progress by travelling to the mainland."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting from July, Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens can apply for a five-year permit to enter the mainland for short-term purposes such as business, tourism and exchanges.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Food Expo returns on Thursday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, as vendors remain hopeful about sales amid the changing spending habits of local consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, nearly half a million people thronged the five-day extravaganza, with the organiser, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, saying they spent an average of $1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the recent trend of Hongkongers spending their weekends in Shenzhen and other parts of Guangdong Province has threatened local businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's marketing associate director, Eddie Lee, pointed out they've done a lot to promote this year's event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been doing a lot of promotion to communicate the selling point, and the highlights of our expos to...not just our local audience, and by these promotional activities in nearby areas, the Greater Bay Area, we hope also to attract visitors from our nearby cities to visit Hong Kong and participate in our fairs," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the 34th edition of the popular event will be held in conjunction with three other expos, featuring vendors specialising in tea, beauty and wellness products and home appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Admission costs $30 per adult, or $10 if they enter before noon on weekdays or after 6pm every night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An extra $10 is charged for those who wish to enter the "gourmet zone" where visitors are offered a taste of delicacies from around the world, including French foie gras, Australian abalone and Japanese vinegar.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Cyclothon will be revamped this year, with new routes and a sports-themed carnival being introduced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's largest cycling event will return on October 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 50-kilometre race will go through the Sha Tin Heights Tunnel, while the 32-kilometre event will cross Ting Kau Bridge for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both races will start in Tsim Sha Tsui and end at the Jordan Road Flyover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Chan, the board's general manager of event and product development, said a carnival will be held in the West Kowloon Cultural District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's actually very important for us to add more different elements to our Hong Kong Cyclothon," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for a lot of cyclists, after they finish their 50-kilometre or 32-kilometre [race], it will be actually good for them to have some relaxing experiences, either a dance class, yoga class or stretching class. It's a good hangout place for them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Registration for the cyclothon opens at 10am on August 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The board said it will accept more than 6,000 registrations in total this year – 800 more than last year.

    Tam Tak-chi to appeal sedition conviction in top court

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top court on Wednesday granted jailed former activist Tam Tak-chi a final attempt to appeal against his conviction and sentence for sedition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three presiding judges at the Court of Final Appeal agreed to look into whether offences under now-repealed sedition laws must be tried at the Court of First Instance before a judge and a jury, and if the prosecution has to prove a defendant intended to incite others to commit violence or public disorder in order to secure a conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appeal is set to be heard by Hong Kong's top court on January 10 next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam, a former vice chairman of People Power, had lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his conviction and 40-month prison sentence for his chanting of slogans in the street in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judges at the lower court ruled that the intention to incite violence was not a necessary element for the offence, and that there's nothing suggesting people were subject to "an unacceptably harsh burden" due to the restriction imposed by it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sedition offences stipulated by sections 9 and 10 of the Crimes Ordinance have since been repealed and replaced by provisions in Hong Kong's domestic national security law.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of the SAR's Olympians have mixed views over the remuneration local athletes receive, with some saying a better package would certainly help, while others said Hongkongers already receive good support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Entry level full-time athletes can get around HK$7,000 a month in sponsorship from the Sports Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing a recent call from badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu, fencer Cedric Ho said more support would certainly help, noting that plenty of athletes have to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As someone who had been there myself, back in the day I would need to save money sometimes," he said on Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I did was I was extremely thrifty, I don't go out for a meal and force myself to eat whatever at the institute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, sailor Nicholas Halliday said Hong Kong athletes already do quite well compared to some overseas counterparts, calling the pay packages "reasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the airport, after competing at the Paris Olympics, another sailor, Russell Aylsworth, agreed, saying they "owe it all" to the institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the Hong Kong Sports Institute has given Nic and I and my sailing partner Akira Sakai tremendous support, they've been very, very helpful. Without them, I wouldn't be able to call myself an Olympian for sure," he said.

  "I just want to thank everyone in Hong Kong for supporting and watching the both of us sail, I just want to inspire the youth, and for all the other sailors coming up, just to continue to train hard and push hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Halliday and Ho said they plan to qualify for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for now, Halliday said he's looking forward to having some down time and enjoying some Hong Kong food favourites like cheung fun.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation has been launched into suspicions that medicine from a public hospital ended up for sale on an e-commerce platform, authorities said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, HKTVMall said it had removed a merchant from its online marketplace after a buyer complained that packaging for an order came with a label indicating the product had originally been given to a patient of Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The product is a laxative which is not classed as a poison and does not require a prescription or for sales to be supervised by a pharmacist, the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, the administration expressed "grave concern over the suspected resale of public hospital patients' medicines" and said the matter will be dealt with seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The DH (Department of Health) is liaising with the Hospital Authority to seriously investigate into the alleged case and shall take prompt enforcement action as appropriate," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this specific case, the DH will investigate along the line of illegal sale of unregistered pharmaceutical products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, So Yiu-wah, president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists, suggested that "over-prescribing" of medicines by public hospitals could have played a role in the alleged incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patient rights advocate Tim Pang, from the Society for Community Organisation, said doctors at public hospitals tend to dish out too much medication because of the length of time patients have to wait for their next consultation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang said more community pharmacies would solve this problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because if there are enough community pharmacies for patients to refill the drugs, then the public hospital doctors can prevent from prescribing a lot of drugs to the patients during that waiting period," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten thousand flats will be built near the future Pak Shek Kok MTR Station next to Tolo Harbour and the Science Park, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new East Rail Line station, between Tai Po Market and University, is expected to be completed by 2033.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the Development Bureau said the MTR Corporation is carrying out extensive technical assessments for the station's construction and land development strategies, with a detailed plan for the project to be announced later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Scott Leung said the MTR station and related transport infrastructure should be built before the residential units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's also a member of the Housing Authority, said this approach would ensure efficient and convenient transport for the residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources told RTHK the government was working to have two giant pandas arrive in the SAR by late September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two adult pandas, aged between five and eight, are a gift from mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government confirmed that Secretary for Culture, Sports, and Tourism Kevin Yeung would attend a signing ceremony for a cooperation agreement in Sichuan regarding the arrival of the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will head to the province on Thursday morning with representatives from Ocean Park, and will oversee the logistics of transporting the animals to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said Yeung would also be responsible for naming the pandas, adding that September 26 is one of the potential arrival dates for the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Yeung's return to Hong Kong on Friday, Raistlin Lau will serve as acting culture, sports, and tourism chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee had earlier paid a visit to Sichuan, and said the male panda chosen by mainland authorities is agile and smart, while the female panda is gentle and cute.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Insurers may not pay out if trips to Japan are cancelled or cut short in the event that a feared "megaquake" in the country actually materialises, an industry representative said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On August 8, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern island of Kyushu, prompting Japanese authorities to issue their first-ever warning of an increased risk of a major quake in the near future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers has urged travellers to carefully study the fine print of their policies, adding that they may not cover disruption linked to a "known risk" such as any further quake connected to the one of last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [insurance] scheme was purchased after the initial earthquake on August 8, then people may not receive compensation if their trip was cancelled or cut short," said the federation's chief executive, Selina Lau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Hong Kong airport, a man surnamed Lo and his family were checking in for their flight to Tokyo on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said they decided to go ahead with the 10-day trip after confirming their travel insurance was still valid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We planned the trip for a very long time. I don't want to disappoint my kids and family. It is a bit risky, but we still want to go," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman surnamed Yip said she had "no choice" but to go ahead with her trip to Osaka as she did not want to lose the money she paid for the flights and hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I booked the trip around five months ago and I could not apply for a refund now," she said, adding that her insurer had reassured her that the trip would still be covered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have checked the consulate's phone numbers and if anything happens, I will deal with it when it comes," she said.

    'High interest rates weigh on SMEs confidence'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Senior Standard Chartered economist Kelvin Lau (right) says lingering global uncertainties have affected SME business confidence. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766023_1_20240813172255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Productivity Council on Tuesday warned that a high interest rate environment is putting pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with business confidence among SMEs dropping to the lowest point in two years
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a quarterly survey conducted by the council in July, 56 percent of the 814 local businesses interviewed said high interest rates had affected consumer spending, with the most affected industries being retail, accommodation and food services and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, about one-third of the SMEs interviewed said they had a cash flow or supply chain problem because of the high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said business sentiment among SMEs remained cautious, with the latest Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index recording a decline in confidence to 42.5 points, dropping from 47.3 in the previous quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief innovation officer Lawrence Cheung said 10 of the 11 industries involved in the survey had shown a drop in confidence, with real estate having the lowest score. He said that indicated both external and domestic-oriented sectors were under-performing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Standard Chartered senior economist Kelvin Lau said the survey indicated a lack of confidence among SMEs over the global economic outlook due to external uncertainties lingering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Number one is the possibility of [Donald] Trump coming into office after the US elections in November. And the other being China's recent macro data weakness following its slightly weaker than expected Q2 GDP [growth], which came in at 4.7 percent rather than anything closer to 5 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So overall, it's kind of like a double whammy that the local businesses need to worry about the US and they need to worry about China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he added there are certain bright spots, citing expectations the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates from September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our own view is that we could see a collective 75 basis points of cuts between now and the year-end and possibly even more cuts in the first half of next year, to as much as 125 basis points in total,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So that would hopefully be a lot of relief to the Hong Kong SMEs, in particular the real estate sector, for example, and to some extent the accommodation and food services sector as well.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 People on low-incomes in Hong Kong are struggling to afford nutritious food and some are having to skip meals altogether due to rising prices, an NGO said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Food Grace said it carried out a survey involving more than 500 underprivileged people in Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po, finding that a third had cut back on the number of meals they ate due to financial difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost half of the respondents said that to save money, they either opted for less healthy food or went hungry on occasions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO described the situation as worrying and urged the government to provide food subsidies to those in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Angela Lo, project manager with the group, said better education on healthy eating would benefit many people who need to cook on a limited budget.

 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Tuesday said underprivileged students who are taking part in a government mentorship scheme in Hangzhou have been able to learn a lot about Chinese culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister is leading a delegation taking some 80 teenagers to the mainland city, as part of the Strive and Rise Programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after a museum visit, Chan told reporters the teenagers he spoke to have become more confident and pro-active.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last year we began by organising five tours, and the reaction was quite good. Students who joined were all very happy. This year we've increased to 18 tours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, we want to encourage more enterprises and partners to offer us more sponsorships, so we can organise more of these activities that allow children to go on trips and learn more about the country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added it's important for the students to gain knowledge from their mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong, who retired right after her victory at the Paris Games to join the Jockey Club, is also part of the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Strive and Rise Programme was introduced in Chief Executive John Lee's maiden policy address in 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospital bosses have expressed concerns and vowed to take follow-up action after a woman was allegedly sold a medication prescribed by a public hospital from a purchase via HKTVmall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The online shopping site said it had removed the product from its shelves and was investigating the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a photo circulating online, the woman, who was reportedly 38 weeks pregnant at the time of the incident, complained she had placed an order for lactulose, but received the laxative with another patient's name and information indicating it was from Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident came to light on Monday following a post on the online discussion forum LIHKG, with the woman who claimed to be the buyer expressing concern about the quality of the medication and whether it would affect her baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, HKTVmall said the customer reported an issue with the product on July 9 last year, upon receiving the order on May 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the vendor was unable to provide information about the order, given that it had been delivered to her in May 2023, with relevant security camera footage and photos deleted, while the report was filed more than a month after delivery
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site said it had removed the seller from its platform and the vendor must provide valid information of its proof of delivery, HKTVmall added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If violations are found, the vendor will be penalised. In serious cases, we will terminate the contract, and the vendor concerned will have to bear the relevant legal responsibilities," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority, for its part, said it was very concerned about the incident and reminded people not resell or pass the drugs for others' use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials would follow up seriously and refer to law enforcement agencies if any illegal activities were found, the authority added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds flocking to malls to watch the Paris Olympics boosted footfall, an operator said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties' leasing department said its mall in Kwun Tong saw 20 percent more people compared to the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said this was because social distancing measures were still in place during the Tokyo Games, adding that there was a joyous atmosphere this time due to the success of the SAR and national teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said sales went up significantly at restaurants, as well as stores selling trainers which saw a 20 percent increase in business. She said watching the events inspired people to take up exercise or sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another reason [for increased sales] was that there were breaks between matches, the short ones lasted five to 10 minutes, while long ones could span over half an hour, or one hour. During this period of time, as residents wanted to continue watching the Games, they would wander around and return to the atrium to watch the match after enjoying their meals," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said business at eateries rose 15 percent during the Paris Olympics, with people heading to shopping malls to watch the Games, and shops opening much longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said food delivery services also enjoyed a 10 percent growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although there are a lot of people going to spend their time and entertain themselves in the Greater Bay Area, especially in Shenzhen, during the Olympics, I saw that more people stayed in Hong Kong, especially during night-time," Wong told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[For] some people, even though they went to Shenzhen during the day, they rushed back to Hong Kong, just wanting to view the competitions."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eric Chan is on a visit to Hangzhou. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765914_1_20240812215848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Monday said the government is considering loosening the eligibility criteria of one of its talent schemes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, people who graduated from the top 100 universities or institutions in designated world rankings can apply for a work visa in Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters in Hangzhou, Chan said the government is reviewing the scheme to possibly include more universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are some universities whose subjects may not be in the top 100 in the world, yet they are popular and very good. We are currently reviewing the scheme to see if these universities should be added to the scheme," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can never have too many talent. The more talent there are, the more useful they will be to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan is joining a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme visiting the capital of Zhejiang province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have participated in quite a lot of activities under the programme, but all of them were held in Hong Kong," he said during the welcoming dinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is also my first time to leave Hong Kong with our fellow students for the mainland. I am looking forward to visiting Hangzhou Branch of the National Archives of Publications and Culture with you all tomorrow, to learn about the rich history of our country and Zhejiang."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan will also meet with leaders of Hangzhou and Zhejiang to discuss deepening cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy mayor of Hangzhou, Xu Weihua, highlighted Hong Kong's role as Hangzhou's largest source of investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As of the end of last year, Hong Kong companies had invested in 8,278 projects in Hangzhou, with a total investment of US$256.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are 56 businesses from Hangzhou that are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In fact, it's not an easy feat. There are 305 publicly listed companies in Hangzhou in total, and one-sixth of them are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,” he noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu said he hopes more reciprocal visits between Hangzhou and Hong Kong would take place, and the two cities would explore deeper collaboration and exchanges in areas such as trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said the five-day trip will be a very valuable experience for the youths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong, who's now an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club, is also taking part in the trip.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday urged Hongkongers in Japan to be careful after the country's authorities warned a "megaquake" was possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japanese officials issued their first ever megaquake advisory last Thursday after a 7.1-magnitude quake hit the south of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR administration said Hongkongers in Japan should exercise caution, attend to their personal safety and pay attention to announcements on the latest situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation. It urged any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or the Chinese Embassy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested a 27-year-old man after finding more than 200 kilogrammes of cocaine in a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the haul has a street value of HK$175 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrest was made in Lok Ma Chau on Saturday and officers said the suspect is due to appear in court on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said the flat where the drugs were found had recently been rented out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We would like to make an appeal here, especially to large property owners. If they notice potential tenants who seem extremely eager to rent these units or even request renting immediately after a quick look around, they should be extra cautious and pay attention to their backgrounds," he said.

    DAB calls for register of subdivided units

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday urged the government to set up a system to register subdivided flats in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as the government is preparing a report on ways to address substandard accommodation, including setting minimum standards for subdivided units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB members visited more than 20 subdivided flats as part of a study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party is proposing that subdivided flats should have a minimum area of seven square metres and a minimum height of 1.8 metres and must comply with building and fire safety regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said that for safety reasons, the kitchen and bathroom in these flats should be separate, adding that the government should prioritise eliminating unsafe subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen quite a lot of fire accidents, some of the poor subdivided units don't have windows and fire protection... this makes it quite dangerous for the people who live inside," said lawmaker Vincent Cheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also says residents of units deemed to be unacceptable should be provided with rehousing options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If [residents] live in a very poor subdivided unit, they can choose to move into transitional housing," said Cheng.

    Pest that strips trees bare now on HK Island: expert

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pest which ravages the leaves of trees like the Chinese banyan leaving them bare is increasing being found on Hong Kong Island after spreading from other parts of the territory in the hot weather, an expert warned on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Larvae of the Phauda flammans moth feed on the leaves of ficus trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The insect was a rare sight in the SAR until around 2019 when it appeared in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, according to Ken So, chief executive of The Conservancy Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the number of trees on Hong Kong Island affected by the pest is increasing, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For insects, because the life cycle can be shortened or the reproduction of insects can always be affected by weather conditions, particularly talking about the temperature. Higher temperatures would favour the reproduction or growth of insects. So likely, the problem of Phauda flammans is highly related to hotter weather," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said pesticides can be used to control the insect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once the larvae eat the leaves with pesticides, then it will kill the larvae, so that it stops or terminates the life cycle of the insects," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So added that professionals are also developing a trap specifically for Phauda flammans.
