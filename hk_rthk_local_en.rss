<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets to local demonstrations by mainland Olympians who did well at the Paris Games were all snapped up in a little more than half an hour on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were some 5,000 tickets available for the public to go to two demonstrations on August 31, and a gala show the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The events are part of a three-day visit by the delegation to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people joined an online queue for the HK$20 tickets when they went on sale at 10am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two demonstrations, at Victoria Park Swimming Pool and Queen Elizabeth Stadium, will feature divers, swimmers, gymnasts, as well as table tennis and badminton players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After departing Hong Kong, the mainland delegation will spend three days in Macau.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven people, including the chairman and an executive director of a listed company, have been arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in connection with a fraud case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The investigation revealed that the chairman of the listed company and other individuals had allegedly falsified business documents and accounting records of the company's subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macau, while the company's trade receivables totalling over MOP$113 million (about HK$110 million) were reduced,” the ICAC said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Meanwhile, the individuals concerned had also allegedly used false documents and accounting records to conceal the misappropriation of the company's funds over HK$9 million.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said it had teamed up with the Securities and Futures Commission to search six premises earlier this week and arrested the seven individuals involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees had allegedly committed the offence of agent using documents with intent to deceive his principal under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macau police also searched the company's offices in Macau and interviewed individuals as part of their investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC added the investigation was ongoing and it would not make further comments on the case.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary golfer Gary Player, who won more than 160 professional tournaments over a career that spanned seven decades, will feature at the Fanling course in November as an ambassador of the LINK Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South African player hailed the tournament as “Asia’s Major”, marking “golf's development in China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Taichi Kho, the first player from the SAR to win on the Asian Tour, said he was excited to return to his home Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s the event I've been looking forward to the whole year and whether I play well or not, I know everyone has my back and I feel so much support from the local crowd and the Hong Kong Golf Club and everyone involved,” said Kho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think golf is a sport that comes and goes. Sometimes you score well and sometimes you don't. But I feel very proud of the fact that I've been able to stay focused all year and stay disciplined to do what I set out to do.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So it hasn't surprised me that my golf has come along nicely the second half of the year and I look forward to continuing that momentum into the final stretch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year’s champion, Ben Campbell of New Zealand, will also play to defend his title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Open will take place from November 21 to 24, featuring a prize purse of US$2 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A delegation from Polytechnic University has won nine awards at the Silicon Valley International Inventions Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A cardiac monitoring device that's a tiny, light, wireless and wearable patch garnered two awards, including the semi-grand prize and a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Zheng Zijian, who led the research team behind the patch, said the device is as accurate as the machines used in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our permeable electronic skin, [electrocardiogram] electronic skin is the first of its kind that allows ICU-grade accuracy for long-term wearable… The permeability is superb, so that you can allow for long-term and accurate monitoring,” Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So for the next phase, we're working with the industries, venture capitalists, and trying to commercialise our technologies.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A nighttime brace designed to help teenagers with scoliosis earned a special prize issued by the Korea Invention Promotion Association, as well as a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Joanne Yip, who led the research team involved, said the brace could be commercialised next year and could sell for about HK$3,000 to HK$4,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our product, this nighttime brace, is the first one in the world using textile and soft robotics to provide early intervention for the patients with scoliosis. I can say this product is actually designed based on the patient's will, that we want to give them a more comfortable, but yet effective treatment,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are recruiting patients in Hong Kong for the clinical trial… We want to commercialise next year and because I think the cost is not too high, so it's affordable for patients and their families.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  University vice-president Professor Christopher Chao said this was the second time PolyU had joined the technology exhibition in the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the main purpose was to help the research teams and startups understand the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They need to understand more about the market and also the investment ecosystem more, otherwise all these startup companies may not be able to be successful. In fact, this is sometimes even more important than the technology itself,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday announced that its first-half net profit for 2024 dropped three percent year-on-year to HK$6.13 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's bourse operator said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$4.36 per share, three percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, HKEX said net income for the second quarter, covering April to June, rose nine percent to HK$3.16 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were supported by the growth in trading and clearing fees from higher volumes across the cash, derivatives and commodities markets, according to HKEX's earnings statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKEX's Chief Executive Bonnie Chan said sentiment appears to be on the mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, while macro-environment uncertainties persist, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year," she added. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Smart vending machines along harbourfront in service

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six smart vending machines along the Wan Chai harbourfront are now in operation, selling grab-and-go snacks and beverages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following a soft launch on Wednesday, people can order ice cream, popcorn, candyfloss and drinks from the self-service, unattended machines between 7am and 11pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities are hoping to provide such services round-the-clock in future, but did not offer a timetable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the soft launch period, we will monitor the visitor flow and see if there is anything that we can do better elsewhere along the harbour," said the Development Bureau's senior engineer, Phoebe Wu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brendan, 6, was among the first to try the machines and told RTHK: "I just got ice cream and popcorn... I think they need like 100 kinds of flavours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist surnamed Bleazard said the prices for food and beverages, which are between HK$18 and HK$35, were reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The vending machine is good because you don't have to talk to anyone. You just choose what you want and you pay and you go,” he said. "Otherwise, you have to wait for the person, and hope they're open."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kiosks are part of an initiative announced in this year's budget to introduce food and beverages, retail and entertainment services on a pilot basis at “suitable harbourfront locations”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is hoping to introduce similar facilities along the promenade in East Kowloon by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Sports Institute is reviewing a funding scheme for athletes, with an outcome expected early next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as debate continues as to whether the city's athletes earn enough to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government has been working to provide a more supportive environment to our athletes, so they can better train, compete and enjoy a good career path after retirement," Lee said at a reception for SAR Olympians at government headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Authorities have been in close contact with the sports institute and sports associations to strengthen the subsidy schemes and training regimes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on Facebook afterwards, Lee said Hong Kong is proud of every Olympian, "whether they won a medal or not".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foil fencer Ryan Choi reignited the debate on athlete funding on Tuesday when he posted details of an unnamed teammate's income and expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the fencer received a monthly allowance of HK$7,130 while having to shoulder costs for competing overseas, including air fares, accommodation and registration fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I only want to shed light on the situation faced by some of my teammates, and hope they'll receive better treatment," he said in another online post on Wednesday, before removing both posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the reception, the president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, Timothy Fok, said more events are in the pipeline to make sure the athletes remain in the limelight after the Paris Games.

    Housing Society to put rents up by 10 percent

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Society on Wednesday announced 10 percent rent increases for residents of the 20 public estates it operates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Each household will see a rise of at least HK$230 per month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes come into effect in October, but tenants will be given a three-month waiver given the current economic situation of Hong Kong, the society said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The public housing body is envisaging a revenue loss of almost HK$24 million due to the waiver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The society stressed that in increasing rents, it has taken into account how much tenants can afford to pay, along with its financial needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it has incurred an operational loss over the past two years due to rising maintenance costs and it expects further losses in the next two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the new rent levels will remain unchanged until the next review in 2026.

 Students who got to meet Hong Kong's Olympians in person on Wednesday said they learnt a valuable lesson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sharing session, which followed an open-top bus parade by the athletes, took place behind closed doors inside government headquarters in Tamar and lasted about half an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlie, who trains in track and field, said she found out what it takes to become an elite athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a great opportunity for us student athletes to have a better understanding of how high, elite-level athletes, how they compete, what they prepare mentally, physically and also maybe psychologically on such a big stage, the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it's a great experience for us to know more about the profession, and also it allows us to be more motivated for our own respective sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the session, the athletes headed outdoors to meet fans who had been waiting at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey drew cheers everywhere she went, and she stopped to sign autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians then gathered on the lawn for a photo with some primary school pupils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes' packed schedule was set to continue in the afternoon with a lunch hosted by Chief Executive John Lee, followed by a joint reception by the SAR government and the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China.

 The Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics on Wednesday received a hero's welcome around town, with excited fans braving the rain to applaud the athletes on board two open-top buses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 90-minute parade featured members of the team such as Paris gold medallist and fencing queen Vivian Kong and swimming star Siobhan Haughey, who took home two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's only two-time Olympic champion, fencer Edgar Cheung, did not attend the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two buses carrying the star-studded delegation set off from the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Sha Tin and passed by Tai Wai MTR station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier, considered the best viewing locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shirley, one of hundreds of onlookers, voiced her support for the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All athletes are worthy of our attention, because everyone has to put in time and effort. Not just the champions and runners-up, but all Hong Kong athletes. They all deserve our applause," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Su was part of the enthusiastic crowds in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so excited. It was amazing. I yelled the loudest at the scene. I cheered for Vivian Kong, Siobhan Haughey, and Hong Kong. I told Vivian Kong not to cry, and to give us smiles," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dan, who's from California, said: "I think it's great. Hong Kong needs to support its athletes and its sports people more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a good way to meet the people of Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes received roaring applause as they arrived at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alice, 11, said she got an autograph from Haughey towards the end of the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that she is very perseverant. When she sets a goal, she won't give up. I also swim, so we are kind of the same person," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The athletes] did a great job and I want them to keep going and never give up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR team bagged two gold and two bronze medals at the Paris Games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Tuesday said it opposes a report by Bloomberg which quoted US firms as saying they were concerned about the city’s proposed new legislation to enhance cybersecurity of critical infrastructures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bloomberg said in its report earlier that some US tech firms had warned that the proposed cyber regulations could grant the SAR government “unusual access” to their computer systems; and giving authorities “overly broad powers” could threaten the integrity of service providers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article also said the American Chamber of Commerce and Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce have also submitted letters during the public consultation period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR administration called Bloomberg’s report biased, saying it had taken the views of the submissions out of context.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the one-month consultation of the legislative framework ended on August 1, the HKSAR Government received 53 submissions, in which 52 submissions supported the legislation and made constructive suggestions, including those from the Asia Internet Coalition, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,” a government statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The proposed legislative framework only concerns protecting the Critical Computer Systems (CCSs) of the Critical Infrastructure Operators (CIOs), which in no way involves the personal data and business information.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It pointed out that similar legislation already exists in other jurisdictions, such as the mainland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the European Union and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “CIOs have the responsibility of properly responding to cyberattacks. Only when a CIO is unwilling or unable to respond to an incident on its own would the Commissioner's Office consider applying to a Magistrate for a warrant to connect to the CCSs or install programmes in the CCSs in view of necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and public interest,” the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the administration will continue to engage industry stakeholders in formulating the legislative regime and the related Codes of Practice.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty secondary students who recently returned from a young astronaut training camp have described their experience as rewarding and inspirational, saying they hope to follow in the footsteps of China's astronauts and make history one day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The teenagers were selected from a pool of around 200 applicants and went through a rigorous screening process, with three rounds of interviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over nine days from late July, they visited the Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Gansu province and the National Time Service Centre in Xi'an.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They even got a chance to meet Liu Yang, China's first female astronaut who was part of the Shenzhou-9 mission in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 20 of the students met the press at the Space Museum in Tsim Sha Tsui on Tuesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Alex Ngan, who said he was impressed by the progress achieved by the nation on space exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We went from a satellite that could only know how to repeat one singular song to a space station - it's simply unthinkable," the year eight student from the Canadian International School of Hong Kong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To see the sites that these historic events unfolded and to actually hear from the professionals that work in this field is an amazing experience and I will remember it forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng Tin-ho, a secondary five student from Tsang Pik Shan Secondary School, was touched by the professionalism of workers at the space centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They work in very remote locations, far away from their families and had to endure extreme temperature changes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But they remain dedicated, devoting their lives to what they are most passionate about. I hope I can do the same in the future and contribute to society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest tour was fully sponsored by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now in its 13th edition, the training camp admits 30 students every year.

    'One Country, Two Systems key to reunification'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the United Front Work Department has stressed that the continuous development of the One Country, Two Systems principle in Hong Kong is playing an important role in China's reunification.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a speech at a conference held in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Shi Taifeng said the SAR is key to the country's reunification efforts, adding that compatriots in the city have all along loved the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The continuous development of the implementation of One Country, Two Systems in Hong Kong will provide important reference and play an important role realising the complete reunification of the motherland," Shi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are more confident and capable than ever before to realise the nation's reunification."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Politburo member said that "Taiwan independence" is a dead-end and the initiative to resolve the Taiwan issue has always been on the side of the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current situation across the Taiwan Strait is complex," Shi said in the speech at the Overseas Chinese World Conference for Promoting Peaceful Reunification of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anti-China forces in the West have resorted to any means to inhibit China's development and intensified their efforts to use Taiwan to contain China. The Democratic Progressive Party has been stubbornly insisting on 'Taiwan independence' and inciting cross-strait confrontation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of Beijing's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, said seeking reunification is an aspiration of the Chinese people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History has shown that all attempts to oppose China and seek independence would not succeed. When it comes to safeguarding national unity, no one should misjudge the country's firm determination and strong capabilities," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, for his part, called on people to "tell the good story of China's reunification".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's success since its return to the motherland has fully demonstrated that One Country, Two Systems is a good system for solving problems left over by history, and for promoting world peace and development," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 1,200 people attended the conference in Hong Kong, the second time the SAR has held the event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures released on Tuesday showed that overall consumer prices in Hong Kong rose by 2.5 percent last month compared with the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That inflation figure was larger than the corresponding increase of 1.5 percent in June and was the highest since November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed higher inflation data to the end of concessionary measures for ratepayers in June, and a rise in transport costs to and from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term. Domestic costs may face some moderate upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties," a government spokesman added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers are being urged to be more supportive of gamers, after a teenager from the SAR was crowned the world’s best Pokémon trainer this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng Yip-kai, who played under the username of “yekai0904”, took home Hong Kong's first Pokémon GO World Championship title and a US$20,000 prize after pulling off a 3-1 win against a Dutch opponent in the grand final in Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng, 16, who bowed out early in last year’s competition in Japan, said in a post-match interview that his victory was proof of his dedication to the game and had been a chance to prove himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former Hong Kong Pokémon Go team leader, Sam Cheung, told RTHK that there are currently about 50 active competitive players of the mobile game in the city and Cheng was the SAR’s sole representative this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Cheng had received criticism and insults following his early elimination last year, but showed his resilience with a victorious comeback this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he hoped Cheng’s success will change what people think of gamers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If you watch any live streaming of the Pokémon GO World Championship, you could see on many occasions Cheng used fluent Mandarin and English to do interviews. This shows that he could sharpen his language skills while playing video games. I believe if parents read Cheng’s story they will change how they view gamers,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lai Ching-lung from the University of Hong Kong sponsored Cheng's trip to Japan last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was happy to learn about the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai added that he hopes more people will participate in Pokémon GO and help pay for young gamers to compete overseas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials say safety inspections have been ordered at Eastern Hospital after two pieces of concrete and part of a false ceiling came down in one of its wards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nobody was injured in the incident in the integrated medical and geriatric male ward at around 8.15pm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the pieces of concrete were 20 centimetres long, 30 centimetres wide and three centimetres thick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceiling was repaired and the ward is operating as usual, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital is very concerned about the incident and has arranged safety inspections to the facilities in the ward again immediately. The hospital is investigating the cause of concrete spalling," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital has regular inspection of hospital facilities and the last inspection at this area was in April last year."

 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, on Tuesday recorded the first senior Grand Slam victory of his career, after beating Chile's Cristian Garin in the first qualifying round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong went a set down, 4-6, before fighting back 7-6, 6-3 for the victory against Garin, who's now ranked 116th in the world but was once as high as 17th in 2021 and made it the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China player is currently ranked 38 spots lower than the Chilean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong will next play Chinese Taipei's Hsu Yu-hsiou in the second round of qualifiers. Hsu is ranked 185th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are three rounds of qualifiers in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The draw for the main round of the men's singles will be made at Friday midnight, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Wong won the Australian Open junior doubles title two years ago.

 Four people from Hong Kong have been arrested in Thailand on suspicion of drug trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thai authorities seized 14kg of heroin and said the suspects tried to send the drugs to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were arrested at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to an inquiry from RTHK, the Immigration Department said it has confirmed the identities of those arrested through the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added that it will follow up on the case.

    Govt ensures local workers get priority: Chris Sun

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says companies should prioritise hiring local workers before turning to non-local labour. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766798_1_20240819204009.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Monday reassured local workers that the government would ensure they have priority in employment amid concerns about competition with non-local labour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun's remarks came a day after the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) called for the setting up of a mechanism that would trigger the suspension of labour importation schemes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FTU said local employees are facing challenges in finding jobs in the retail, catering and construction sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three sectors were included in labour importation schemes introduced by the government last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Sun stressed that companies should prioritise hiring local workers before turning to non-local labour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only when companies fail to hire a sufficient workforce through local recruitment can they proceed to the next stage – to apply to import labour through industry quotas or general schemes. This demonstrates that the mechanism (of labour importation schemes) itself guarantees priority for local workers in employment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most importantly, if local workers show greater willingness to work, the number of imported labour will subsequently decrease."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The welfare minister also said the government is looking into setting up a database for high-risk caregivers after an elderly woman and her son, who had cared for her, were found dead in their Kwun Tong flat earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the authorities will take privacy concerns into consideration.

 Chief Executive John Lee said the Hong Kong government will continue to fully and accurately implement the One Country, Two Systems principle and leverage the SAR's strengths to serve the country's needs as he met with the visiting head of the United Front Work Department, Shi Taifeng.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shi, who's also a Politburo member and vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, is in Hong Kong on an inspection visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They exchanged views on issues of mutual interest in their meeting at Government House on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the SAR government will focus on creating strong impetus for growth, improving its governance system, resolutely implementing the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong", and strengthening Hong Kong's patriotic forces with a love for the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that the recent third plenary session of the Communist Party offered important guidance for the city's long-term development, prosperity and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Hong Kong government and all sectors of the community should earnestly learn, have a thorough understanding of and implement the spirit of the session.

 Equestrian athlete Natasha Tse left for Britain on Monday for two final weeks of training ahead of the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Growing up with cerebral palsy, which hinders movement and muscle control, Tse embraced horse-riding at a young age of four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making her Paralympic debut in London at just 15, the veteran is gearing up for her fourth Games in early September, where she'll be competing in the individual para dressage event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this time, Tse is bringing two “horses”. Check out our video to find out why.

    Lower tax for companies sponsoring athletes: DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called on the government to offer tax concessions to businesses that sponsor local athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Cheng, who is also the vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), explained the number of companies sponsoring athletes was limited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are a lot of big companies that are really interested to support all the sports events. When we're talking about the marathon, the badminton competition, they do have a title sponsor," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [number of] companies supporting the athletes [is] not a lot. So, we hope that later on in the future, the government can encourage more companies to support the athletes directly, like supporting their salary or hiring them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also urged the government to purchase broadcasting rights for the upcoming 15th National Games, the 2026 Aichi-Nagoya Asian Games in Japan as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this would make it easier for residents to follow the competitions, rally behind home-grown athletes and provide a boost to the local catering and retail sectors.

    Some toilet paper can clog sewage pipes: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that toilet rolls which hold up well in wet conditions may not break apart quickly after use and can clog sewage pipes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council said it tested 25 types of toilet paper rolls in accordance with mainland standards, comparing absorbency, strength, softness, ease of flushing and hygiene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the overall hygiene and standard of the toilet paper tested was satisfactory, but four types didn't disintegrate so well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When consumers buy toilet rolls, they need to make a choice, whether they want a tougher, stronger product to use, or to balance the implications to their toilet drains," said Consumer Council Chief Executive Gilly Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said it also found that many types of toilet paper lacked proper package labelling, omitting essential information such as the number of sheets per roll, dimensions, weight and expiry dates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It urged manufacturers to improve product labelling and to ensure that all necessary information is clearly displayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong cautioned people against stockpiling toilet rolls and reminded consumers that proper storage of toilet paper in a dry, cool and well-ventilated area is crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Toilet rolls are not vacuum packaged, so if it is put in a high humidity environment… It can easily get moist and have germs or mould,” she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 People who are unhappy with the quality or performance of a new pair of sports shoes should not be afraid to follow up with the retailer, as the consumer watchdog says there is a good chance they will be compensated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Manufacturers have also been told to do more to make sure their products live up to the increasing expectations from users, amid a steady stream of complaints against functional footwear in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 101 complaints regarding sports shoes between January and July, compared to 227 for the whole of last year, and 257 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A complainant was refunded 80 percent of the HK$1,170 he forked out for a pair of sports shoes which claimed to be waterproof, but weren't.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water began seeping into the sneakers after he wore them about five times, and the problem persisted with a second pair that the store offered free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the shoes were sent back from the factory following an inspection, the man noticed the inner rubber trim began to peel off. But the manufacturer refused to repair the defect, triggering the complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's chief executive, Gilly Wong, offered some practical tips to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You really have to examine the product very carefully when you buy it, and if there's anything wrong, you should bring it forward to the retailer very promptly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on our experience in dealing with these kinds of complaints, the manufacturers are very willing to accommodate and settle the dispute, because they want to uphold their brand reputation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also urged manufacturers to devote more resources to maintain production quality, and not to just focus on design.

 The government will hold a bus parade on Wednesday to celebrate the triumphant return of members of the Hong Kong team who took part in the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Athletes, coaches and other members of the team will set off from Sha Tin in two open-top buses and arrive at Tamar Park to receive the cheers and applause of the public along the route.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upon their arrival at the park, the athletes will participate in a sharing session with students on their Olympic experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also attend a luncheon hosted by Chief Executive John Lee at Government House at noon, ahead of a welcome home reception.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best viewing locations for the bus parade will be Tai Wai Station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buses will depart from the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Sha Tin at 10.15am and will reach Tamar Park shortly before noon.

    Newborn pandas doing well, still fragile: Ocean Park
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Monday said the two newborn pandas were doing well, but they remain fragile and it would probably take a few weeks before they started showing signs of strength.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ocean Park chairman, Paulo Pong, said veterinary experts were working behind the scenes to help Ying Ying care for the cubs that were born last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said on RTHK the park was thankful the Sichuan panda research centre had been providing the SAR with milk to feed the cubs, because Ying Ying doesn't have enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth on the eve of her 19th birthday – the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong said the newborns have been eating and discharging well, and it would be another week or two before they grow black and white fur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mainly I think the key is how the babies eat. How much breast milk they can take in, and that they can feel the temperature from their mother - how they sleep and rest. All these are important aspects for newborn pandas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So now that we offer help artificially, on top of Ying Ying learning slowly how to care for the cubs, these things really complement each other. And we hope things will continue on smoothly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong said it could take the newborns two months before they open their eyes, and learn how to walk some four months after birth. He said the theme park would try to give timely updates on the pandas, all while not giving too much pressure to the conservation experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the park would first discuss internally how it would expand its existing facilities to house six pandas, as Beijing's gift of two more are arriving next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's time, Pong said, since it would take around two to three years for the cubs to leave Ying Ying and live on their own.

    Youngsters hit hard by customer service staff scammers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are stepping up publicity efforts against fraud after the number of deception cases in Hong Kong went up by 6.2 percent to nearly 20,000 in the first half of the year, incurring losses of HK$4.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But instead of the elderly, the force is now actively reaching out to young people after noticing a demographic shift in victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of all fraud cases between January and June, 1,605 involved victims who fell prey to swindlers claiming to be customer service representatives of online platforms such as Taobao and WeChat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That number shot up to 1,111 in July alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-fifth of those victims were aged between 18 and 29, compared with only seven percent who were 70 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's because WeChat Pay and Taobao are commonly used by young persons, and they are the tech-savvy generation," said senior superintendent Tsang Nga-sze of the Commercial Crime Bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the cases, a 50-year-old clerk lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to a swindler posing as a WeChat representative last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was told by the fraudster that he had subscribed to an insurance scheme with an annual fee of HK$70,000, and the plan would be renewed automatically if he didn't complete the cancellation process within that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the scammer's instructions over the phone, he transferred a "guarantee payment" to the swindler, in a bid to verify his identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the process, the scammer sent me some links with bank logos on it, and also [showed me] their staff card, which made me believe that the fraudster was a genuine WeChat representative," the victim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He only realised he had been conned after he was ordered to set up a virtual bank account, apply for a loan and then transfer all the money to a designated account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police warned that September and October are peak months for mainland students to get scammed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually, scammers will use the excuse that their visas have some issues because they are involved in some investigations," said superintendent Theodora Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As they are new to Hong Kong, and really want to study or work here... they will believe that they are the true officials from mainland China... and make relevant transfers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force emphasised that the public should ignore calls and messages involving money, or asking for personal details.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of trafficking and manufacturing dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man, who claimed to be jobless, was detained as part of a police raid on an industrial unit in Tsuen Wan on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing the press on Sunday, senior inspector Chan Yu-wing from the Narcotics Bureau believed the suspect received instructions remotely from a syndicate on how to manufacture drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers have also confiscated 2kg of suspected ketamine, and 6kg of raw materials, with a total street value of HK$960,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also discovered a large quantity of corrosive substances. In fact, during storage or heating, these chemicals could easily catch fire or explode," Chan warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Therefore, these drug syndicates are completely neglecting public safety. Their actions are extremely irresponsible. If members of the public or security guards in a building smell something suspicious coming from a unit, like a pungent chemical smell, they should contact the police immediately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect will appear before the West Kowloon Magistracy on Monday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has pledged to actively consider a proposal to set up a third medical school in Hong Kong to address the shortage of healthcare professionals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event honouring doctors on Sunday, Lo said the government will bolster the training of local doctors and retain medical personnel in public hospitals to tackle the staffing shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent years, the government has allocated over HK$30 billion to fund the construction of medical training facilities at universities," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, the SAR government will continue to support the two existing medical schools by enhancing their teaching capabilities, boosting admission quotas and sources. The government will also actively consider a proposal to establish a third medical school."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently only the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong offer medical programmes in the SAR, with the schools producing a combined 590 graduates each year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Nancy Ip, told the media in February that she hoped to launch the city's third medical school by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She revealed the initial intake of 50 students would be gradually ramped up to 150 per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo also said in the meantime, the government will continue to introduce non-locally trained doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects more than 250 doctors who were trained overseas will have joined the public healthcare system by the end of this year.

    Hong Kong economy will improve next year: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday the city's economy is expected to improve next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a two-hour public forum in Tai Po to solicit views for the upcoming Policy Address, the SAR leader heard numerous appeals from the audience to prop up certain industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A securities worker said he had never seen so many brokerage firms shut down. While acknowledging efforts by the SAR administration to lure investment from abroad, he felt the sector has yet seen any material impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lee admitted "difficulties" and "challenges" in the current environment. He believed investors are taking a cautious approach, citing factors such as the upcoming US presidential election, the interest rate development, as well as geopolitical uncertainties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, "those bet against Hong Kong in the long run will be the first to lose", Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the global economic axis is shifting to the East. We should focus on Asean countries and the Middle East, which are the new engines for global development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader was also urged to provide more support to the cultural, sports, and tourism sectors, fresh off stellar performances by Hong Kong's Olympians at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, culture, sports and tourism have been emphasised as a whole. We have had great news recently with the birth of the twin panda cubs, while two more giant pandas are on their way as a gift from the central authorities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More consultation forums will be held in the coming weeks, before Lee delivers his third annual policy blueprint in October.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government announced on Sunday that a delegation of national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics will visit Hong Kong at the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The elite athletes will arrive in the SAR by plane on August 29. Fans will have a chance to greet them at three public events - a gala show on the evening of August 30, and two concurrent demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park Swimming Pool on the morning of August 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will depart the city on the same afternoon and make their way to Macau, where they will stay another three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also meet local athletes at the Sports Institute, and attend a reception and banquet hosted by the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Who exactly will be coming remains unknown, but the Leisure and Cultural Services Department confirmed there will be badminton and table tennis stars, as well gymnasts, divers and swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has expressed gratitude to the General Administration of Sport of China and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office for arranging the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong people will be able to share the national team's joy and triumphs, thereby strengthening their patriotic passion and national spirit, especially among the youngsters," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE noted past visits by the national team had "always been a craze", and hoped the athletes will share their journey of perseverance and success and promote the spirit of Chinese sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 5,000 tickets for the events will go on sale from 10am on Thursday. Each person can buy no more than two tickets, priced at HK$20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some seats have also been reserved for the underprivileged free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identity checks will be enforced at the door to weed out scalping activities, and the government urged spectators to arrive ahead of time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former chief executive CY Leung said on Sunday he hopes more young people can join the country's global charitable drive, saying Hongkongers have an advantage in such work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the GX Foundation, which he set up six years ago, has been helping seven countries in three different continents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes performing surgery for some 15,000 cataract patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's now a vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said when he visited those places, the conditions reminded him of China's past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I go around these places, I see situations worse than how our country was some 40-plus years ago. The medical and public health conditions were rather bad," Leung spoke on a Commercial Radio programme.

  <br/>
  "So we utilise the strength of our Chinese community and provide help, do something. And we've got some good results. Such initiatives also help to connect Chinese and overseas peoples."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charity now plans to provide water filtering services to needy countries, on top of educating young people about the Belt and Road Initiative and public health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hongkongers have unique advantages in joining these charitable drives for China, such as the convenience of visa-free travel with an SAR passport, and the city's role as a global aviation and logistics hub.

    URA hits back at homeowners over maintenance needs

buildings have been earmarked for redevelopment. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766630_1_20240818124905.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority on Sunday criticised homeowners who complained about their buildings being earmarked for redevelopment just after they had started maintenance work on their buildings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statutory body's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, said it is wrong to think that it is a waste of money to repair dilapidated structures, saying it is a matter of public safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the URA announced redevelopment plans for a tenement block in To Kwa Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The building, which is more than half a century old, was already undergoing repair works with scaffolding erected across the facade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The media cited  flat owners as saying that they'd rather not continue with the rest of the works - now that their block would most likely be knocked down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Wai reminded owners it takes quite a long time for a redevelopment project to be completed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's a maintenance need for buildings earmarked in renewal plans, or they have received mandatory inspection or repair orders from the government, the homeowners really should not delay the procedures and think that they can just wait for the URA's acquisition," he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because in the event that during the wait, a lack of repairs leads to an accident that causes injury or even death, it is possible homeowners will have to shoulder relevant legal responsibilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said if homeowners kept relevant records and receipts for the maintenance works, they would be able to apply for ex gratia reimbursements from the URA after they accept an acquisition offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He explained that redevelopment projects must be kept confidential before their launch, because they involve acquisition and compensation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A search is continuing on Lantau Island for two stray dogs who were allegedly abused by workers of the Po Lin Monastery last Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police confirmed they have arrested two men, aged 65 and 46, on suspicion of animal abuse. Both have been granted bail pending an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair, who worked as chefs at the Buddhist institution, allegedly removed the canines from the quarters, before setting them free at a remote location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monastery said it has arranged staff to look for the stay dogs near Sham Wat Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement online, it said, "the monastery has always been kind to stray dogs around Ngong Ping, providing them a shelter, arranging sterilisation, vaccination and basic medical treatment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprawling monastery on Ngong Ping is home to the Big Buddha, one of the main tourist attractions of Hong Kong.

    Hongkongers told to not panic about mpox outbreak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Infectious diseases expert Professor Ivan Hung says the chances of the mpox virus spreading to Hong Kong is very low. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766586_1_20240817180654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Saturday were told not to panic about the more deadly and transmissible clade 1b strain of the mpox virus, but those belonging to the high-risk groups should stay vigilant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advice from infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung came after the World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared the mpox outbreak in Africa a global health emergency - the highest level of alarm that can be issued by the world body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 18,737 suspected or confirmed cases of mpox were reported in Africa since the beginning of the year, including 1,200 cases in a single week, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit country, the Democratic Republic of Congo has reported 222 confirmed and 783 suspected cases, as well as 24 deaths in one week, the African Union health agency noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Hung told RTHK that the chance of the virus spreading to the SAR was very low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he urged those belonging to high-risk groups - such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, bisexuals, and laboratory workers - to get vaccinated and watch out for symptoms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include a rash, a fever, coughing, and a stuffy nose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But important, of course, is that you have to take extra precaution if you belong to the high-risk groups and also those who are immunocompromised, then of course you should be cautious and consider taking the vaccines,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong professor also urged people to avoid travelling to high-risk areas in Africa, and not to touch wild animals so as to reduce the risk of catching the viral disease. (with additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tobacco and Control Office on Saturday said it launched a crackdown on the smoking of waterpipes, also known as shishas or hookahs, in Tsim Sha Tui on Friday night, issuing 11 fixed penalty notices at one bar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers including those in plain clothes raided the bar, handing out the notices which carry a penalty of HK$1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also said the bar's operators may be prosecuted under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance, and for aiding and abetting smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tobacco and Control Office spokesman said due to deeper inhalation a waterpipe smoker usually inhales more toxins and that a typical one-hour session exposes the user to 100-to-200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also flagged the carbon monoxide poisoning risk of charcoal burning and the unhygienic smoking apparatus

    Sports Institute head defends athlete sponsorship

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) chief executive Tony Choi says the institute provides the city's athletes with an overall package, which includes some financial sponsorship, but athletes are not its employees.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments come after Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary general of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, said local athletes didn't have a need to spend much as they were allocated with accommodation, training, and medical support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But online criticism continued following the SAR's success at the Paris Olympics, with athletes chiming in and saying they had to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Choi said entry-level full-time athletes get around HK$7,000 a month, so they could focus on training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSI and the athlete are not employer and employee," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But also we are including overseas training, local training, coaching support, accommodation, meals, and also education support. It's an overall package for the elite athletes... They are not our staff."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi denied that the limited subsidy provided had led to potential athletes dropping out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see many athletes dropping out... We tried our best to help, in terms of other expenses, which included study, career planning. We hope to give athletes motivation... If many potential athletes dropped out, Hong Kong wouldn't have achieved good results," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi added that "only the fittest will survive", and resources given to athletes were inevitably hinged on their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-chairman of the HKSI, Vincent Cheng, said a review on a direct subsidy scheme for local athletes will be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have to review every four years. We're going to have this review starting from September and October, and hopefully we can finish it earlier next year. We will review... especially on their subsidy support," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong saw heavy rain on Saturday morning with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning for about five-and-a-half hours until just before 11 am. There were no reports of any damage, although there was some flooding in Ma On Shan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government put out a call for the public to report any flooding and for employers, contractors, and employees to be aware of electrical safety at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rainfall comes less than a day after the Drainage Services Department outlined seven projects to cope with the increasingly frequent extreme weather conditions, with the Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok signing five contracts relating to the projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new projects follow the extreme rainstorms last September and a commitment to implement them by the Chief Executive John Lee in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include six underground flood storage tanks in Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City, Shek Kip Mei, Sha Tin, Tai Po, and Kwun Tong along with drainage improvement works in those districts and in Eastern District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storage tanks, which have a total capacity of more than 200,000 cubic metres, will be at Shek Kip Mei Park, Morse Park, Hoi Bun Road Park, Argyle Street Playground, Tai Po Old Market Playground, and Sha Tin Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work will be completed in phases over the next three-and-a-half years to six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five contracts signed on Friday totalled HK$6.4 billion.

    We will ensure panda cubs' survival: Ocean Park

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ocean Park says the giant panda cubs are currently fragile. Photo courtesy of Ocean Park" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766509_2_20240816230134.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Friday said it is sparing no effort to ensure the survival of the newborn giant panda twins in Hong Kong, with experts keeping a watchful eye on the cubs around the clock.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing a day after their birth, the park reassured that the twins' survival rate is higher in captivity, compared to those born in the wild.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Howard Chuk, the head of Zoological Operations and Conservation at Ocean Park, noted that experts from the mainland are also playing a role in ensuring the baby pandas’ survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the cubs are actually being handled by the experts from Wolong [National Nature Reserve]. We make sure the cubs could [reach] a more stable status," he said, adding that they hope the mother panda, Ying Ying, can raise them later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But of course, we do hope that Ying Ying can learn it and experience it, and not jeopardise her welfare management."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying gave birth to the twins on the eve of her 19th birthday – the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Ocean Park's chairman, Paulo Pong, confirmed that the new cubs will stay in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Luckily at the same time we're actually receiving two new pandas. So it's perhaps the double gold from the Olympics, perhaps it's the double bronze from the Olympics that gave us even more luck," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope this will bring great fortune to Hong Kong and we hope to continue our journey in our works of conservation and education," Pong added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Friday said he expects the public could meet the two new giant pandas gifted by the central authorities in December.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Yeung visited Sichuan where he attended a cooperation agreement signing ceremony on the arrival arrangements for the two giant pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up his visit, he said the two giant pandas are expected to arrive in the SAR by late September. But he said the pair would have to undergo one month of quarantine and that they would need another month to adapt to their new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that Ocean Park may need new facilities to accommodate giant pandas, as the city's panda Ying Ying gave birth to two cubs on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong, in the future, may have six giant pandas... Newborn giant panda babies can live in the same environment with their mum until they are two to three years old," he told reporters at the airport here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still have time. In the next one or two years, we can plan for long-term arrangements regarding the living environment of the six giant pandas."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that the two newborn giant pandas are currently in a stable condition, and that the twins would continue to stay in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Newborn giant pandas need special care because of their small size, such as in terms of their body temperature or how they take in milk," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But people don't have to worry about that. Experts from the mainland and Ocean Park are closely monitoring their situation. We are providing the most professional and the best care for the cubs."

    Job market remains stable for fifth straight month

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's labour market remains stable, with the unemployment rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive month. File photo: Xinhua" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766471_1_20240816172116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's job market remained steady, with the latest government data showing the unemployment rate at three percent between May and July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure has been unchanged since March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a government spokesperson warned the labour market could be under pressure in the short term, as changing spending habits of locals and visitors would dent consumption-related industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the jobless rate remained consistent, around 3,100 people still lost their jobs in July, joining more than 114,000 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, the labour force expanded by 8,400 to roughly 3.83 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weak domestic demand continued to weigh on consumption-related industries. The jobless rate for the retail sector worsened by 0.4 percent to 4.3 percent, while food and beverage industry hit five percent after going up three-tenths of a percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other sectors improved, notably trade and wholesale, accommodation services, transportation, insurance sector and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market "should remain tight in the near term", according to labour and welfare minister Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Statistics from the Labour Department suggest job hunters have much less choice. There were around 71,700 private-sector vacancies in July, a 31 percent decline from a year ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

 Immigration officials on Friday said they had arrested three people on suspicion of working illegally in the SAR as photographers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department said it believes the trio – a man and two women – had advertised wedding and street photography services on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they pretended to be customers and arrested the three suspects after they entered Hong Kong from the mainland as tourists.

    Make HK a hard liquor trading centre, says lawmaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB's Kennedy Wong said if Hong Kong didn't lower or scrap hard liquor duty, it would lose out to Hainan Island and Macau. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766395_1_20240816093031.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong says Hong Kong should scrap its 100 percent levy on strong alcohol so it can match the wine industry and become an international trading centre for hard liquor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Wong said the wine trade had boomed since duty was scrapped in 2008 and revenue from sales of alcohol with a strength of over 30 percent was only HK$700 million. He also said Hong Kong needs to compete with Hainan, which will be tax free by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look at this issue from a trade perspective. If we don't lower or scrap the duty we are already losing out to Macau and the surrounding areas and at the end of this year, when Hainan turns into a free trade zone, a lot of the whisky, brandy promotions - because they are all aimed at the mainland China market - they'll all move to Hainan. Hard liquor from mainland China, like the Moutai, the Wuliangyee, they won't use Hong Kong to tap the international market, they might as well use Hainan," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong had the highest liquor duty in the region with Macau only charging 10 percent. He said Hong Kong also charged more than Taiwan and Japan, although the duty here was about the same as South Korea. He said Hainan, which caters mainly to the mainland domestic tourist market, had been declared a tax free area by the State Council in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said if Hong Kong followed the same route as the wine trade here, it could be an attractive place for companies wanting to sell top-of-the range hard liquor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You scrapped the duty so a lot of aged or vintage wine moved to Hong Kong and because Hong Kong also had first-class storage facilities - and because of our close proximity to the mainland China market, which is a big, big market you know for the wine industry - a lot of wine merchants created off-shoots here including a lot of French vineyards, chateaux that I know," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think likewise for liquor: for vodka, for whisky, for brandy, for the Moutai and so on. If they all create more trading companies here and then they are willing to move some of their vintage - the nice liquor - to Hong Kong, then Hong Kong will gradually climb back to the top of the world in this particular field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month the DAB called on the Chief Executive John Lee to scrap the duty on hard liquor as part of its proposals for Lee's upcoming policy address.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda pair of Ying Ying and Le Le have finally produced babies, after they successfully mated in March this year at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After five months of pregnancy, Ying Ying gave birth to one female and one male in the small hours of Thursday. Ocean Park, where the giant panda lives, said she spent much of her time lying on the ground and twisting, and that she was in labour for more than five hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ocean Park Hong Kong is thrilled to welcome the birth of the first-ever giant panda twins in Hong Kong," the amusement park said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This birth is a true rarity, especially considering Ying Ying is the oldest giant panda on record to have successfully given birth for the first time," the park said, adding that she gave birth just one day before her 19th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both cubs are currently very fragile and need time to stabilise, especially the female cub who has a lower body temperature, weaker cries, and lower food intake after birth. Currently, both babies are under 24-hour intensive care by the park’s animal care and veterinary team, as well as experts from China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee called the birth of the panda twins a very special occasion, and thanked the nation for having gifted Ying Ying and Le Le to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Ocean Park's team for taking good care of the city's giant pandas and experts from the research centre for their support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested the driver of a tram involved in a fatal crash that killed a three-year-old girl in Western District on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tram was travelling along the eastbound track of Praya, Kennedy Town at 10.40am, officers said. But when it approached the pedestrian crossing near Des Voeux Road West, it reportedly knocked down four people who were crossing the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year-old girl was trapped under the tram and was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital in an unconscious state. She was certified dead at about 12.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A six-year-old girl, a 34-year-old woman and a 66-year-old man also sustained injuries and were sent to the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 48-year-old male driver on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and that he is currently being detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For their part, Hong Kong Tramways said that according to their preliminary understanding, the tram was operating as usual when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that they suspended the driver after the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it is very concerned about the incident and that it has asked the tramway operator to investigate it in detail and submit a report as soon as possible.

    Ridership, property earnings boost MTR profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR Corporation has proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766327_1_20240815183232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday reported an almost 45 percent rise in first-half profit compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by a strong recovery in ridership and earnings from property development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the railway firm conceded that passenger numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, even after patronage jumped more than four percent to surpass 950 million in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jacob Kam, the MTR's chief executive officer, said ridership had not been "very good" in the second quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe there are many factors that would affect patronage, the overall economic situation, consumers' patterns, they all play a role," Kam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to be cautiously optimistic as the economy recovers. We hope that patronage will improve over time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, the railway giant posted a net profit of HK$6 billion, up 44.7 percent from the same period in 2023. Total revenue rose 6.2 percent year-on-year to HK$29.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the MTR proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share, same as the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm also reversed its HK$774 million Hong Kong railway business loss into a profit of HK$415 million, while earnings from property development more than doubled to HK$1.74 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are making progress on 14 residential property projects. We will continue to explore property development opportunities along our existing and future railway lines, making optimal use of all land resources," Kam added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the firm will roll out more discounts for commuters, he said the corporation has to invest more than HK$100 billion for its projects in the future, and that it has to be prudent with its finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the railway giant is looking to tender the Tung Chung East project again after it failed to receive any bids last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively studying our projects and we are looking at our tender strategy. Subject to market conditions, we shall continue to orderly tender out our land parcels, in order to meet with the demands of Hong Kong," said David Tang, the firm’s property and international business director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for a land use study near Pak Shek Kok, the corporation said the assessment, which includes the possibility of constructing a new station along the East Rail Line, is still ongoing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population fell by 0.1 percent between mid-2023 and the middle of 2024, according to government estimates released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures by the Census and Statistics Department showed that the SAR's population slid from 7,536,100 in mid-2023, to 7,531,800 in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the territory saw a net outflow of 30,200 residents, but 44,000 one-way permit holders came to the SAR, resulting in a net inflow of 13,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the population saw a small increase in the first half of 2024 due to the introduction of various government policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Benefiting from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation, there was sizeable inflow of persons from the mainland and other places around the world to Hong Kong in the first half of 2024," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Yip, a population expert from the University of Hong Kong, said authorities had to work on retaining talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to make the people who decided to come to Hong Kong, stay in Hong Kong...I think we also have to diversify our portfolio. Not only from mainland China, we also like to attract, some foreign talent from other places too," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to make Hong Kong to be a truly cosmopolitan city, I think we do need talent to come from different places, [like] the Belt and Road countries and also Europe or the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures showed that Hong Kong saw 34,400 births last year, a five percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies, along with other proposals to promote births, was announced in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said the policies announced last October might not be reflected in the official data yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it would be very interesting to see whether there would be any substantial increase in 2024. But I think even if there is any impact, it will be quite limited," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's largest food festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Thursday, with enthusiastic bargain hunters racing inside as the doors opened at 10am sharp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some of the visitors to Food Expo said they had queued up overnight just to snap up bargains or freebies, such as ready-to-eat abalone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were looking to rediscover old favourites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We bought some Taiwanese rice flour noodles, because we went to Taiwan before so I just want my kids to try again," said a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tourists were also at the exhibition centre to sample new flavours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just got some coffee and some coffee beans. I'm from Australia so we really like coffee over there. I've got some peanut chocolate butter as well, that's really nice. Hadn't seen that before," Andrew Frank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully the customs doesn't take it away from me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vendors, on the other hand, seized the chance to learn about the preferences of local customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Illugi Gunnarsson, who distributes Icelandic farm products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very good opportunity for us to meet people from Hong Kong, really see how they react to our products. But it also gives us an opportunity to sell, of course we like that, but mainly to understand our customers," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau, meanwhile, underlined the contribution the convention and exhibition industry makes to the SAR's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The convention and exhibition industry has always been crucial to Hong Kong's economy by attracting high-spending overnight business visitors to Hong Kong, spurring economic activities and creating employment opportunities," Yau remarked at an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am glad to know that this week's fairs have gathered over 1,800 high-quality exhibitors from 28 countries and regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expo will take place until Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Thursday said it recorded about four million visitor arrivals in July, with about half involving overnight stays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure was a 10 percent increase on the same month last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 80 percent of July's visitors came from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said Hong Kong received about 25 million visitors in the first seven months of this year, over 50 percent more than the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the city held several events, including drone shows and pyrotechnic displays, adding that a survey of tourists found more than 90 percent believed the drone shows had enhanced their visit experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said it will organise drone shows and pyrotechnic displays during Mid-Autumn Festival, Christmas and New Year's Eve, and will stage a new year countdown fireworks performance.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association on Thursday said it welcomed a possible relaxation of the eligibility criteria for a talent attraction programme, saying it would draw more professionals to the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the moment, graduates of the world's top 100 universities are eligible to move to the SAR under the scheme. On Monday, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government is considering expanding the list of universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who founded the association, said at a press briefing that an expansion would boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This plan would give more support to Hong Kong's economy, and provide more and more entrepreneurs coming to Hong Kong and make more startups in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang also urged the government to offer more support to the children of professionals arriving in Hong Kong through the programme, saying they might encounter challenges when adapting to a new educational environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called on employers to provide housing allowances to incoming professionals due to accommodation costs in the city.

 A three-year-old girl has died after being struck by a tram and getting trapped beneath it in Western District.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The accident, which happened outside the Kennedy Town Swimming Pool on Thursday, also saw two others injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency personnel were called to the scene after a report at around 10.44am that the trio, a man and two young girls aged three and six, had been knocked down by the tram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the three-year-old was unconscious as she was rescued from underneath the vehicle. She was later pronounced dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man and the elder girl were also taken to hospital for treatment.
