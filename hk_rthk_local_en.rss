<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday said there are more companies than ever in Hong Kong, which shows that the city is a vibrant, reliable and convenient place to do business.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said there are over 1.43 million local companies and around 15,000 non-local firms as of April - both record high figures for Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said new companies were emerging, outnumbering those who folded by about 4,600 last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, it said the number of bankruptcy and winding up petitions fell in April.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The authorities received 742 bankruptcy and 66 winding up petitions last month. The figures were slightly lower than those in March, but still at least 30 percent up from a year ago.

    'Double peak flu seasons' by two virus strains: doctor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An infectious disease expert on Saturday warned that Hong Kong could be hit by a double whammy in which its peak influenza seasons are dominated by two flu virus strains -one after another this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ivan Hung, who's also a professor at the University of Hong Kong, said that the influenza virus infections have rebounded to a relatively high level in recent time, as residents have low immunity to influenza after three years of the pandemic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said while the peak flu season dominated by the A subtype H-3 virus strain ended last October, infections have continued this year , and the SAR also has to contend with a peak season dominated by the A subtype H1 flu virus strain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In January we have already had the influenza peak season for the subtype H3 virus, and then starting in April and May, we had the peak season that's dominated by the subtype H1 virus.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “While the H1 virus-led inflections might ease from June and July, there's a chance that we might see the H3 virus making a comeback to form another small peak season from August and September ,” he explained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “But I think overall, the H3 virus-dominated peak season might be less serious compared with the one seen last year,” he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The infectious disease expert again called on parents to take their children to get a flu vaccine shot prior to the summer vacation, as there were many serious cases of children infected by the subtype H1 virus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also noted that the city’s Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases had recommended that the Department of Health increase the procurement of the nasal vaccine to raise vaccination rates, as young children were more willing to receive the nasal vaccine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Hung predicted that the new Covid variant - KP.2 strain - that was discovered in the city’s sewage system, will replace the current prevalent variant - JN.1 - as the dominant Covid strain. But he said the new variant will not cause severe cases.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The cash-strapped West Kowloon Cultural District on Saturday said the M+ and palace museums may have to restrict the days on which they open unless the government replies promptly to its financial proposals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Henry Tang, who chairs the cultural district authority's board, told i-Cable News that they have already handed in plans as to what to do when the authority's funds are drained next year, but the administration has not responded.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the government should have also completed a study into the authority's finances.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang said the arts hub will run out of money in June 2025, and that it's now taking loans.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If the government delays [giving us a reply], we'll need to take big steps to cut costs. For example, the museums might just open four days a week, instead of six. The Xiqu centre may also open on fewer days," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But will this be fair to the public? After all, this is not a commercial undertaking but a key public policy project."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang added that restricting the days the facilities open will also go against the national policy to establish Hong Kong as a hub for cultural exchange.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He had earlier told local newspapers that they did not wish to request more public money, but could shore up the cultural quarter's finances by selling part of its 40 hectares of land.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said a decision on their funding proposal will have to be made by June to enable contracts to be signed for new exhibitions and projects.

    'Govt poverty alleviation strategy not precise'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chua Hoi-wai, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Services, says on the same programme that while the government's projects to tackle poverty have good feedback, they only support a limited number of people. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753673_2_20240518115702.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Social welfare lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen on Saturday criticised the government’s latest strategy to ease poverty by saying that such strategies are not “precise” or “accurate” in alleviating poverty as they did not include other groups that also require social support.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 His remarks came after authorities earlier identified around 950,000 elderly people, single parent households, and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tik said the latest strategy could not comprehensively reflect the city’s poverty situation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am not against having these target groups, but I think there aren't enough targeted groups, because there are also the disabled, the chronically ill, the mentally ill, and so on. So I think it's not 'broad' enough in terms of identifying the families who need key assistance.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Secondly, the targeted groups are also not 'precise' enough, as it's very general to say that there are over 900,000 people [in these groups], but what about different levels… within them?” he commented, adding that the strategy is not “accurate”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The legislator also believes that the government must maintain and improve the so-called “poverty line”, instead of “abandoning” the gauge, as it could reflect whether those targeted measures to tackle poverty are having an effect.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The ‘poverty line’ uses Hong Kong median household income as the sole gauge to measure poverty. The government earlier said such a gauge is no longer appropriate, and it will come up with a more accurate way of monitoring poverty levels later this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The latest strategy is target group-based, and the poverty line is income-based, these two have different calculation methods and are not comparable,” Tik noted.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Chua Hoi-wai, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Services, which represents some 480 non-governmental social services organisations (NGOs), said some government-led projects to tackle poverty aren't effective enough in offering help.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He cited the “Strive and Rise Programme” the government set up as an example and said that such a project, despite having positive feedback in recent times, is only supporting a limited number of people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “There were about 2,000 pupils covered in the previous cohort under the programme, and about 4,000 covered in the current cohort. All these numbers are far [smaller] compared with poverty figures showing tens of thousands," Chua told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The programme cited was aimed at addressing inter-generational poverty issues by pairing under-privileged students with volunteer mentors - along with financial support:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The government might need to explain to the public why the number of assisted pupils is so small?” he asked.

    Taxi industry has got to change: transport minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said future taxi fleets will have to allow digital payments, install video recording technology, and should respond to complaints.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam told a Commercial Radio programme that he hopes this government initiative to step up taxi management will enhance service standards.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We hope the fleet management will... shift the culture of the whole taxi industry, because we have got to change. If we go on like this, the taxi industry will just get worse and people will have less and less confidence in it," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The official said applications for taxi fleet licences are closing at the end of the month, and the licences will be issued in mid-2024.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the fleets should start operating within a year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Lam said the upcoming taxi fare hike is needed so the industry can stay financially sustainable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said taxi drivers earned HK$17,000 to HK$20,000 a month on average last year, and some of them had seen their income fall.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "After taking into account inflation, some taxi drivers - for example those working on Lantau - earned a lower income than they did in 2019. We think this isn't good for the taxi sector's long term development," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The cost of gas and insurance have also gone up. We considered these factors before reaching the decision."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said they had also considered if people would accept a fare hike, before announcing that flagfall for all taxis will rise by HK$2 from July 14.

    SAR's health sector needs to be 'innovation driver'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau (left) is upbeat on the prospects for the SAR's health and dental sector - as long as it continues to innovate. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753668_1_20240518104520.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau said on Saturday that he's confident that Hong Kong's high quality healthcare and dental services will remain competitive, even though some local patients have been heading north for services on the mainland that are cheaper.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said while some patients think the mainland offers better value-for-money services, the SAR has nothing to worry about so long as the profession keeps improving its services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Professor Lo said on RTHK's Your Home Address programme that as the government seeks to develop the SAR as an international health and medical innovation hub, Hong Kong can also drive advancement in the field.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong has excellent health care service and we have a wonderful university here with a medical school and a dental school. We're not just good in providing service, we should be good in innovation as well," the minister said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If we are good, we have all the talents, enough talents, we should actually not be looking just at providing services. We should be driving, we should be the driver for innovation."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The secretary noted that a Hospital Authority initiative to offer medical staff low-interest home loans to retain talent has been going well, with some 80 percent - or more than a thousand applications approved.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lo expressed the hope that upcoming legal changes that would allow more non-locally trained healthcare professionals to practice in the SAR will help ease the staffing shortage.

    E-CNY pilot scheme expanded to HK for the first time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer who was earlier found guilty of mortgage fraud involving more than HK$26 million was sentenced on Friday to six and a half years in jail.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Superintendent Harbour Chan was convicted in April of two counts of fraud in connection with two mortgage applications made in 2019 involving a luxury house in Tai Po and a flat in Tung Chung.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Co-defender former chief inspector Wong Ho-ngai was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for one count of fraud.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In mitigation, Chan's lawyer requested the court to consider an appropriate reduction in sentence given that the defendant grew up in a less privileged family and his enthusiasm in participating in public welfare activities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Deputy District Judge Edward Wong said the sentencing starting points for the two charges were set at six and a half years and three and a half years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Considering the defendant's good personal background and special social contributions, a discretionary reduction in sentence was granted, resulting in a sentence of six and a half years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said it has given conditional approval to the environmental study into a plan to turn fish ponds in the northern New Territories into a technology hub.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The department's director, Samuel Chui, said the environmental impact assessment on the San Tin Technopole project took into account a large number of ecological survey findings, and officials did not receive any feedback concerning issues the report did not cover.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The report is scientific, professional and comprehensive. And it doesn't underestimate the ecological value of the area being studied," he told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chui added that amendments to the report submitted by the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), such as birds' names and photos as well as a draft plan to create habitats for animals, did not affect the effectiveness of the study.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said conditions for the approval include that the CEDD has to submit detailed designs for the project and that it must refrain from filling in fish ponds in the area before creating a new one in a conservation park.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chui said the CEDD also needs to set up a panel, consisting of green group members and government representatives, to monitor the development's impact on the environment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The committee will work together to give the best environmental protection," he said. "Just like this time, we have heard many proposals and we will discuss and find the best way to protect the environment and also to conserve the species and the ecology in the area."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chui said the CEDD is taking measures to protect Eurasian Otters, a species of conservation importance. The animals were recorded back in 2019, but were not found during a recent ecological survey.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the department is adopting suggestions from green groups on building passages for the otters, as well as improving the design of buildings so birds will not crash into them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Development Bureau, for its part, welcomed the approval, saying it provides a solid foundation for the government to proceed with the next stage of the town planning process and commence the project as scheduled.

    Surveyors suggest ways to improve subdivided units

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A minimum area of at least 100 square feet, including the toilet and kitchen, as well as ensuring proper ventilation and drainage, were among the recommendations made by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors in its report to a government task force on subdivided units.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Various fire protection measures should also be implemented, the institute noted, including no open flame cooking, partition walls installed between units that could block fire for at least one hour, as well as providing a clear fire escape route.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Other recommendations include having at least one openable window towards open space and separating the kitchen and toilet properly.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The institute estimated that about 30 percent of the 110,000 subdivided flats in the city do not meet these minimum standards and require improvements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kenny Tse, who chairs the institute’s Building Policy Panel, said that generally it would only cost owners tens of thousands dollars to improve their flats, adding that almost all upgrades could be carried out without affecting the building's common area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “All the proposed enhancements should be carried out within the subdivided units, not related to the common areas. For example, the fire service installation, we only need to buy a fire extinguisher, smoke detector or something like that,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “For the drainage part. This is the only one they need to connect to the common drainage pipe, but I think that this is feasible and also easy to carry out."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The institute also proposed a registration system for subdivided flats, saying owners must entrust professionals to inspect and accredit the units. Such inspection has to be conducted every three years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But it said owners of sub-standard units should be given 12 months to make improvements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We have to take care of the over 100,000 subdivided units in existing markets and we think that we cannot treat the 100,000 subdivided units at one time,” said Nathan Lee, who heads the institute’s Building Surveying Division.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “So we should allow some time for the owners to take care of the existing tenants and also provide some relocation for the existing tenants. So we propose 12 months for the modification period.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The institute added these were just temporary solutions and the ultimate solution to the subdivided unit issue remained increasing public housing supply.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday said they were concerned about growing congestion around the Western Harbour Crossing, after changes to tolls made it the busiest of the three harbour tunnels.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Official figures show that since a shake-up of tolls in December, traffic flow at the Western Harbour Crossing has increased by 18 percent to around 103,000 vehicles a day, with queues at peak times getting longer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acting Deputy Commissioner for Transport Leung Sai-ho said officials are planning to construct an additional lane at the exit of the tunnel on the Hong Kong Island side.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Indeed, there's a bottleneck area... I'm sure the project will have a positive impact on the traffic queue and the vehicle speed," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If we can increase the capacity of the road section, we believe this can improve the overall performance of the Western Harbour Crossing."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Work on the extra lane is expected to begin in the second half of 2025 and to be completed by 2027.

    'Green finance to help HK develop hydrogen energy'

Photo courtesy of Civic Exchange" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753456_1_20240516215103.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Thursday said Hong Kong, being an international financial hub, can speed up the development of hydrogen power through financing initiatives that invest in green and sustainable sources of energy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Civic Exchange made the recommendation in its study of the clean energy source, before the government publishes its strategy on the topic in the first half of 2024 in a bid to de-carbonise the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The think tank's research analyst Wing Tsang said the recently released Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance would make it easier for businesses to identify and invest in green hydrogen projects which were completely zero-carbon.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said the SAR could also learn from South Korea, where green bonds are issued to finance hydrogen infrastructure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong is an international financial centre, [we] can line up with the banking institutions, the financial institutions, businesses and the government to make the hydrogen transition happen," she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tsang added the government also needs to address the high costs and insufficient infrastructure of hydrogen energy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong currently has no secure and stable supply of hydrogen, and we must identify available sources of hydrogen locally and in close proximity to Hong Kong to propel the application of hydrogen."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The think tank also urged authorities to approve more pilot projects to speed up the development and adoption of hydrogen energy in the city.

    New law proposed to help contractors get paid on time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau on Thursday proposed legislation to make it easier for contractors in the construction sector to get paid on time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bill would allow a contractor to claim payment every month, even if it's not specified in their contract.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That's a change from the current situation, under which disputes are normally settled only when a contract ends.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bill would also create a new mechanism for settling disputes. A claimant would be able to take their case to an adjudicator, who would make a decision within 55 days.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If payment doesn't arrive, the claimant would be able to suspend or slow down work, and extend the construction period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said it wants to see disputes settled sooner, so everyone involved can get their money faster. It said contractors should see their finances improve, so they can pay workers on time.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials expect the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to pass later this year and to take effect next year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun stressed to lawmakers that social worker licencing decisions will still be made by the sector's regulatory body in futre." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753418_1_20240516165846.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said social workers could in future be banned from the profession for life, if they were convicted of a crime which could warrant a prison sentence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It is among a series of proposed legal changes the administration said would improve the statutory body overseeing the profession, as it accused the body of deviating from the spirit of the law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials want to reform the Social Workers Registration Board such that there'd be more appointed members than elected ones, while in future, all 27 board members would need to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Under the plan, social workers convicted of lesser offences that may be considered to harm the reputation of the profession would also be subject to a permanent expulsion, or a ban of no more than five years as decided by the board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The person concerned could write to the board within 28 days to oppose the decision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As for more serious crimes such as national security offences, murder, sex offences and child abuse, the board would promptly expel the social worker unless the whole board votes otherwise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Thursday described the proposals as nothing major, stressing that deregistration decisions would continue to be made by the board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We're not amending such broad principles [over deregistration]. What we're saying is that we mustn't and shouldn't wait, and there's a new provision to allow for the prompt removal," he told lawmakers at a special Legco panel meeting on the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun also accused the current board of dereliction of duty for not taking any steps to implement legal changes related to national security.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said it should have actively gathered information on whether social workers seeking to renew their licences "may have committed security-related crimes".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Still, New People's Party's Judy Chan expressed concern that social services would be under affected after the changes, saying there might be a scenario where a group of social workers were disqualified.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister dismissed this, saying he thinks most social workers shouldn't have a problem getting their licences renewed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun also stressed the legal amendments only require future board members to take an oath, rather than all registered social workers.

    Govt unveils new measures to cope with extreme weather

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday announced a series of measures intended to help Hong Kong cope better with extreme weather, including new arrangements for MTR services when the second-highest typhoon signal is in force.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trains on overground sections of the network will continue until the end of the line, or at least to a large station where passengers can take shelter, instead of only stopping at the next station when the No 9 typhoon signal is in force.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, scores of travellers were left stranded at the the airport when Typhoon Koinu forced the suspension of the Airport Express and all bus services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In case the train is already in this open section, we will try to reach the final destination as far as practicable and safety permitting," Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said at a cross-departmental press conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If not, we're now planning to stop at a major station in which that station may be big or may be connected to the mall or other commercial areas so that people or passengers could have a better place for shelter so that they can depart the area when the weather allows."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk warned that people who deliberately and repeatedly put themselves in jeopardy during extreme weather may face fines or even prison.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheuk gave the example of people going onto beaches that are closed, adding that the risk is simply not worth it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "What we're aiming to do is dissuade people from having some sort of high risk, very risky activities. If anything happens, it's not just costing them HK$2,000 or 14 days in prison. It will cost their life. It's also endangering the life of my emergency response officers. So what we're saying is do not do something dangerous. Do not put yourself at risk," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheuk also said the observatory will issue advice and warnings to members of the public during adverse weather, adding that a city-wide SMS alert system is only reserved for "unforeseen situations" such as tsunamis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Asked about arrangements when water is discharged from the Shenzhen Reservoir, officials said they will alert Hongkongers as soon as authorities across the border start considering such a move.

 The Hong Kong Children’s Hospital on Thursday said it would open the SAR's first breast milk bank next year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It would collect milk from breastfeeding mothers who produce surplus milk, which would then be used to help premature and critically ill babies whose mothers were unable to breastfeed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bank would only accept donations from healthy mothers who don't smoke.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Dr Lee Tsz-leung, the hospital's chief executive, said the donated breast milk would benefit the health of premature babies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It carries significant benefits for pre-term babies. It will reduce complication. It will reduce mortality rate. It will reduce the length of stay in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and also it will promote the neurological development of these premature babies as well," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The aim is to collect about 800 litres of milk each year, which would benefit up to 600 newborns.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday said many mosquito repellents may not deliver on their marketing, with one brand it checked seemingly attracting the insects instead of keeping them away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Checks on Cherub Rubs Scatterbugs found that more mosquitos landed on the tester's forearm than before it was applied.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Of the 25 repellent brands examined, only one sample, containing Deet, passed the test perfectly, with no mosquitoes landing on the tester's arm.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some natural or herbal brands repelled certain types of mosquito, but not those that spread dengue fever.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, said consumers should choose the products carefully.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Mosquito repellent products with chemical or natural ingredients each have their own advantages and drawbacks. Consumers may consult physicians and pharmacists and choose suitable products according to usage and health conditions," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan also urged the makers of mosquito repellents to list out the ingredients in the label clearly and state whether the product is suitable for children.

    Spam call blocker apps pose privacy risk: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday warned that the personal data of people who use apps to block spam callers could be at risk because some of these apps pass on the information to third parties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The watchdog investigated five such apps and found that two of them uploaded details from the user’s list of contacts onto their databases.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The council found that third parties could then access sensitive details including addresses and the monthly rents the contacts paid.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It's suspected these were extracted from the contact lists of landlords or property agents who also used the apps.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The council found that one of the apps would also access up to eight items of personal data, including names, photos and dates of birth, when registered via Facebook.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, reminded users to stay vigilant when using these apps.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Consumers should pay attention to the following when using blocker apps. Read the terms of service and privacy policy before use, and evaluate whether the blocker app is trustworthy and the permission is reasonably commensurate with the functions offered," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite the privacy risk, Chan also called on users to proactively report spam to help apps identify and block the latest telemarketing and spam calls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World basketball's governing body, FIBA, said on Thursday that it will bring another major tournament to Hong Kong later this year, with the world's best 3x3 men's teams battling it out for the World Tour title.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This year's World Tour will feature 17 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.

    Pay Trend Survey results unveiled

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tentative results of a Pay Trend Survey that would help adjust civil service pay were released on Thursday, but organisers said it would be "premature" for people to presume the administration will adopt their figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The survey, based on data gathered from more than 110 private firms, points to rises of 4.01 percent for senior civil servants, 4.32 percent for middle-ranking workers and 5.47 percent for junior staff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The numbers are not themselves recommendations in any way for an increase, decrease or anything. They are factors to be considered among a number of other factors," said Laurence Li, who chairs the Pay Trend Survey Committee.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's premature to try to forecast how these things will all be put into the pot."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government said other factors to consider when looking at pay rises for civil servants are the state of the economy, changes in the cost of living, the administration's fiscal position, pay claims from staff and civil service morale.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service Clement Leung was asked whether different weight will be put on the various factors when making a decision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Each year, in a way, is a separate exercise, because the economic situation, the situation of the government's fiscal position are different. Every time we will have to have two-way communications with our staff side's representatives," Leung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “That will be something that we will have to work on in the next few weeks, and particularly, listening to the views of our staff associations on their sentiments and their views on civil service morale, as well as their proposals."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, senior civil servants received pay rises of 2.87 percent, while those in middle and junior ranks got 4.65 percent. This was roughly in line with the results of that year's pay trend survey.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department on Thursday announced new ID card replacement arrangements as it prepares to move its headquarters from Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O in the middle of next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From June 11, the new headquarters will start providing services, and the Registration of Persons office in Kwun Tong will also be relocated to Tseung Kwan O.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The main services provided by the Registration of Persons Office in Tseung Kwan O include applications for first registration of ID cards, replacement of ID cards due to due to defacement or loss, and amendment of registered particulars on ID cards," said assistant principal immigration officer Wong Ka-yee.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wong added that the Tseung Kwan O office will also handle the replacement of new smart ID cards during extended service hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 People who have applied for an ID card change on or before June 8 can collect their cards at a temporary office in Kwun Tong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, the Registration of Persons Office at Immigration Tower in Wan Chai will continue to provide ID card replacement services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 2,500 policymakers, academics and medical professionals on Thursday gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for a two-day summit on health innovation and investment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The "Asia Summit on Global Health", jointly organised by the government and the Trade Development Council, features a series of thematic sessions on the latest trends in different medical sectors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee highlighted the importance of public health.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Health is wealth. Health is an ever-revolving discipline that affects all of humanity. It affects the lives of every individual in any economy of the world, big or small, rich or poor, liberal or conservative. Public health is the foundation of society and the very basis of humankind to thrive," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also told the summit that the SAR thrives as an international metropolis that maintains unparalleled connectivity with both the mainland and the rest of the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cao Xuetao, the vice-minister of the National Health Commission, told the same event that Hong Kong has been using its geopolitical advantages to promote healthcare development.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As an international centre for finance, shipping, trade, innovation and technology, Hong Kong has actively leveraged its advantage of having the strong support of the country and being closely connected to the world to innovate in medicine and health," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The mainland official added that it is crucial to work together and explore new opportunities in the field of medicine and health given complex changes in the international situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The final of the Cheung Chau "Bun Scrambling" competition was held on Wednesday night at 12 midnight on the football pitch of the Pak Tai Temple Recreation Ground in Cheung Chau, rounding off a day of festivities attended by tens of thousands of people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Firefighter Yip Kin-man was crowned "Bun King" and nurse Kung Tsz-shan won the title of "Bun Queen."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nine male and three female finalists competed at the same time, clambering up a 14-metre-high mountain covered in 9,000 plastic buns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They had to fill their own bags with buns totalling the most points within the time limit of 3 minutes, to win the coveted titles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kwok Ka-ming, a regular contestant and one of the favourites for the men's title, won the “Full Pocket of Lucky Buns” prize for snatching the most buns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cheung Chau Bun Festival originated as a ritual for people to pray for safety from a plague.

    'HK, Singapore to keep complementary roles'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawrence Wong (right) is taking over as prime minister from Lee Hsien Loong (left). File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753267_1_20240515163949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Singapore will maintain their ties as both “complementors” and “competitors” as they navigate their way through an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, a veteran businessman with cross-market experience in both places said on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The remarks came as the Lion City ushered in a new era, with finance minister Lawrence Wong becoming the city-state’s first new prime minister in 20 years, taking over from Lee Hsien Loong who becomes senior minister of the cabinet.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think it's very positive,” said Dennis Chiu, chairman of the Hong Kong Singapore Business Association (HSBA).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “He [Wong] really reflects the meritocracy system of Singapore, because he came from the very bottom of the ladder and then worked his way all up. He is very much a student of the Singapore system to show that.. in Singapore, anybody has a chance to reach the very top,” Chiu said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When asked how the new leadership might impact the business ties between the Lion City and the SAR, Chiu, who is also the executive director of Far East Consortium International and has straddled Hong Kong and Singapore for three decades, said he expects there will be “continuity” in terms of trade and business cooperation between the two places.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Singapore and Hong Kong have always played a complementary and competing role. And when you compete, you actually pick up good points from the other, so I think we are mutually learning from each other, but we also compete for the same dollar of investments,” Chiu said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I really don’t see there will be huge changes, but I think we will perhaps see how changes in the world will affect Hong Kong and Singapore,” he added, warning that geopolitics has become the most challenging factor affecting all economies, especially open economies like the two cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “You have to be neutral and to not choose a side,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The real estate veteran also said Hong Kong and Singapore could continue to cooperate in areas such as technology and digitisation, adoption of artificial intelligence, and green transition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Hong Kong, frankly speaking, has the huge market of China and the Greater Bay Area, [but] Singapore has Southeast Asia as its very important market. Those will always be the strengths of both of the cities’ finances,” Chiu added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think he [Wong] will be able to continue to carry on Lee's systems with him, we do not expect any new changes for the time being, but we want to see how he will be tested when new issues, such as Covid and international crises, come up,” he said. "This is something we all do not know."

 A taxi trade representative on Wednesday said cabbies are expected to earn thousands of dollars more every month when fares go up, but the sector is experiencing high operating costs and a change in passenger habits.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From July 14, there will be a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ng Kwan-shing of the Taxi Dealers & Owners Association said he believes the fare rises will mean cab drivers will earn around HK$100 extra for each shift, or an additional several thousand every month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But he told an RTHK programme that both insurance and car maintenance cost more now, and that it's been challenging for nighttime taxi drivers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because passengers have changed their habits, there's been less business. I hope that after the fare hike, the government could help with the financial situation, allowing more individual visitors [to Hong Kong], so that we could get more business," Ng said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the same programme, Transport Commissioner Angela Lee ruled out the taxi trade's suggestion of a regular mechanism to review fare rates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade understands its own operating situation best... They may not submit [an application] every year, and it depends on changes to its operations and whether there is a need to ask for fare adjustments," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Every time we receive [an application], we will handle it cautiously and act as the gatekeeper. I think this approach has always been taken and is effective. So we don't have any plans to change it for the time being."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee added that how much cabbies earn is not the sole factor in deciding on fare adjustments.

 Children dressed up as Hong Kong celebrities, star athletes, deities and even government officials on Wednesday as thousands of people flocked to Cheung Chau for the island's annual bun festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Queues formed from the morning at shops offering buns stamped with peace messages, with sellers pleasantly surprised by the turnout.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We expected that there would be a drop of 10 to 20 percent in the visitor numbers when compared with last year. But the situation is better than our expectations," said one storekeeper surnamed Kwok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think people want to experience the festive vibe, while hoping this can bring them peace and luck."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A man surnamed Wong told RTHK he was waiting patiently to get his hands on more than 10 buns in different flavours, for him and his family.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have waited for an hour. But I'm fine with queuing. It's not a big deal. It's just once a year. I've been coming to the festival for 12 years, since 2012," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I just hope everything goes smoothly and I wish for good health. The Cheung Chau residents believe that, so I just follow the local customs."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the main highlights of the festival, the Piu Sik Parade, got underway in the afternoon, with children dressed up as various characters making their way through the island's streets on stilts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mini versions of star fencer Cheung Ka-long and swimmer Siobhan Haughey were in the Olympic spirit ahead of the upcoming Paris Games, while there were also sightings of Dragon Ball characters and Hong Kong singer and actor Aaron Kwok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One child played security minister Chris Tang and another came as Executive Council convenor Regina Ip to explain Article 23 laws to the crowds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another child was decked out as an officer of the Environmental Protection Department, on duty to promote the city's planned waste charging scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alice, an exchange student in the SAR, hailed the atmosphere of the parade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's the drumming, all the little kids, everyone's smiling, happy. I like the lion dancers, the dragons. It's really nice, it's a really good day, lots of sun, so it's good fun. I'm staying around till the bun climbing," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indian tourist Azaira told RTHK the parade was "phenomenal".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's amazing, something I've never seen. But I think most importantly, it's the effort that everyone has taken to make this day so special," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I know it's Buddha's birthday and the costumes, the time, the effort that's taken to put into this. And of course the walking around in this heat.... I love it."

    'Social worker board vets applications individually'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board has stressed that the statutory body reviews every application on a case-by-case basis, after the government suggested the board might have erred in renewing and approving licences from people who had committed serious crimes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers, increasing the amount of appointed members and enabling "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Wednesday said there was an urgency to make legislative amendments, and that there were "very obvious cases" that had deviated from the spirit of the law in the eyes of the public.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Let's say the board approved the renewal of someone who was involved in drug possession or trafficking. I am not saying this is wrong. But it was not reasonable to approve the application, when many people within the Social Workers Registration Board had strong opinions and huge concerns about it," Sun told an RTHK programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, argued on the same programme that people who had done something wrong in the past should be given a second chance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "From the day the board was formed till now, we still review every single application on a case-by-case basis. Even if someone has a criminal record, we will still consider [the application]," Ng said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Some people had committed crimes when they were young. But after many years and undergoing social work training, they had reflected and changed... Even among recipients of 'Ten Outstanding Young Persons' were people who had committed crimes like drug possession or trafficking. Does it mean society should not give them the opportunity to change?"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The proposed reforms will increase the number of board members from the current 15 to 27, with all required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seventeen members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tin Shui Wai secondary school says a teacher who failed to return as scheduled on Sunday from a study trip to the mainland came back to Hong Kong the following day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Education Bureau earlier said the teacher in question didn't make it back on May 11 after a four-day mainland study tour to Wuhan for new hires. It said it would require the teacher and the school to submit a report on what happened.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CUHKFAA Thomas Cheung Secondary School said late on Tuesday that the teacher returned to the SAR on the morning of May 12.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The school has reported the incident to the incorporated management committee and established an investigation committee to follow up on the matter," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The school is also maintaining close contact with the Education Bureau to learn about and handle the relevant incident. No further comments will be made at this stage."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Internet users had claimed that a secondary school teacher from Hong Kong had been arrested during a trip to Wuhan.

 Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday that it will comply with a court ruling and restrict viewing in Hong Kong of 32 banned links related to the song "Glory to Hong Kong", effective immediately.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The action comes after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order last week banning the 2019 protest song.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the injunction helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)

    Mixed reactions to approved taxi fare increases

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People are divided over the authorities' move to approve an increase in taxi fares, with some saying the rise is affordable and others complaining about poor taxi services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Executive Council has approved a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning from July 14, the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs, and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A student RTHK spoke to in Kowloon Tong said the fare increase is acceptable. However, he acknowledged that frequent taxi users may not be happy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am not a frequent user, so I think it is still affordable. But for some people, they may travel quite frequently on taxis. This may be a consideration for them," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A mother who often takes her children by taxi thinks that taxi drivers deserve a higher income for their hard work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I don't think it's a big deal. I think they deserve more money because they work really hard and very long hours. Life has become more expensive, so we have to also expect that this increase needs to happen for the drivers, right?" she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A passenger said that taxi drivers should improve their services before they are allowed to increase their fares.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The price is a bit high considering their performance. The taxi service is so bad in Hong Kong. Nowadays, we don't have a way to reflect the performance of the taxi drivers. If they behave badly, we don't have a way to complain," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A taxi driver said he's worried that the fare hike could lead to a further drop in passenger numbers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "My concern is that if fares increase, we might see a drop in the number of passengers. Business is already tough, especially during the evening shift when fewer people go out."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, another taxi driver believes passengers will find the fare increase acceptable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's a reasonable increase. Passengers will eventually get used to it. Considering inflation, a slight rise in taxi fares should be acceptable to them," he said.

    Exco approves HK$2 rise in taxi flagfall rates

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxi fares are set to go up after the Executive Council approved increases for cabs on Tuesday, but it was far from the jump the trade had asked for.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The industry had suggested a HK$5 increase in the flagfall for urban taxis, and set the initial charges for other cabs at HK$28.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead, the flagfall for urban taxis will increase from HK$27 to HK$29, while the starting rates will be HK$25.5 in the New Territories and HK$24 on Lantau.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The incremental charges will also be raised, with a 20-cent increase per metre jump for the first-tier distance after flagfall for urban taxis. Passengers of green and blue cabs will see the incremental rates after flagfall rise from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For second-tier distances, there will be an increase of 10 cents for all three types of taxis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The new fares are expected to take effect from July 14 after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A government spokesperson said it is important to review taxi fares to ensure a stable supply of services to cater for passengers' needs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade is facing genuine difficulty in maintaining the financial viability of its operation at the current taxi fare level," a statement read.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade hopes that an increase in taxi fares would raise the income of front-line drivers and attract more newcomers to join the industry, while at the same time encouraging taxi operators to improve their services and invest more in new facilities, thereby enhancing the overall taxi service quality and fostering the healthy development of the trade in the long run."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government also noted the approved increases were lower than the levels proposed by the taxi trade, adding the fare hike would “inevitably lead to higher transportation expenses for passengers”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Taxi charges last went up in July 2022.

    Exco endorses plan to reform social worker board

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers that will change the composition so that appointed members outnumber those elected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on the revamp, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the sector doesn't need to worry about the autonomy of the Social Workers Registration Board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At present, six of the board's 15 members are appointed, eight are elected and there is one official from the Social Welfare Department.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In future, 17 members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, Sun said governance of the body must be improved because it has deviated from the spirit of the law. He said, for example, the board had appointed to its disciplinary body a social worker who was facing a charge of rioting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun told reporters on Tuesday that in future, all board members must take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The board exercises public authority. What this means is that the registration of Hong Kong's 27,000 social workers, the disciplinary hearings involving them, all these are to do with public authority," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "So requiring members of a statutory body exercising such authority to swear allegiance, this is only natural. It will ensure that members can safeguard our national security and that they uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the SAR government."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun said at least 14 of the 27 members of the board in future will be social workers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Everyone needs to understand that the source of social workers should actually be diverse. Some of them would be elected, others would be appointed," the minister said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The diversity at the board means that some of the social workers might be renowned professors, some might be respected leaders at social welfare organisations. This would allow for the board's operations to be more diverse and balanced."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the board will also be tasked with setting continuing professional development requirements for the sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government added in a statement that the relevant legal changes, if passed by lawmakers, will enable "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said the proposed legal changes will be gazetted on Friday, with a bill to be tabled to the legislature on May 22.

    'HK keen to promote global cooperation for prosperity'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Tuesday said that Hong Kong is well-positioned to promote global collaboration and contribute to world prosperity, as the city kicked off its first-ever conference with a focus on geopolitics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at the inaugural “Global Prosperity Summit 2024”, Ip warned that Hong Kong faces a “high degree of global geopolitical risks” due to the looming threats of “rising polarisation and political violence”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said these threats were challenging global governance, and have led to protectionist policies of tariff hikes, financial sanctions and export controls to “deny developing countries’ access to advanced technology”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The world is being factored into opposing geopolitical blocks, the free trade and investment environment over the past decades, which have helped hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, seems to belong to a bygone era,” Ip said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “With national elections in 64 countries, affecting 49 percent of the world’s population, taking place this year, politics seems to trump economics everywhere,” she added, noting that signs of polarisation and political violence were also on the rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ip said Hong Kong has a keen interest in promoting ways to resolve such issues, as it is a small but open economy that has a high degree of exposure to global risks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We are a very international and cosmopolitan society, and we are very well-connected. We understand the cultures and political systems of mainland China as well as the culture and systems of the West, so we are well positioned, really, to maximise our role as a super connector and an intermediary between mainland China and the rest of the world,” she told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Ip told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme the SAR is a very suitable place to host the prosperity summit given its reputation as a meeting point between East and West.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “This summit showcases Hong Kong as a platform for international dialogue and communication, because we are able to bring together experts, prominent scholars, former senior officials from all over the world to debate on the issues,” she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “When we have a free trade investment environment, everybody benefits, and we don’t want this to stop,” she added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three-day summit event is sponsored by local businesses and the government and is co-hosted by the think tank Savantas Policy Institute which Ip chairs, covering topics such as de-globalisation, technological cooperation and climate change.

    Advances in imaging tech gives hope to stroke patients

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HKU researchers say advances in imaging technology have allowed more stroke patients to be treated effectively. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753099_1_20240514114851.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A study from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday showed that more than a third of stroke patients who were treated beyond the traditional six-hour golden period had recovered well, offering hope to those once thought untreatable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The researchers studied more than 50 stroke patients who were treated beyond six hours, with the most notable case being a patient who was treated 22 hours after his stroke.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the HKU researchers, Associate Professor of Surgery Kevin Cheng, explained that the key to this medical breakthrough lies in advances in imaging technology, which now allows doctors to assess the proportion of brain cells that can be saved, enabling more targeted interventions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In the past, if we just base on a plain CT scan, we cannot estimate the area of the brain having damage. We can just see if there is any blood," he said
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But with the advancement in the CT perfusion, we can differentiate...which part of the brain is still salvageable and the total volume and the mismatch ratio. So these factors are very accurate and can help us to accurately differentiate those patients who can benefit."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acute ischaemic stroke is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. Brain cells can quickly die while the flow of oxygen and nutrients is restricted, leading to loss of brain function, paralysis, speech problems and even death.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Tuesday said the SAR saw 3.4 million visitor arrivals in April – a 17 percent increase year-on-year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said provisional figures show about 2.5 million of the arrivals, or 73 percent, were from the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HKTB said there was an increase of more than 50 percent in arrivals from other countries compared to April last year, with a more than 80 percent rise from Indonesia, driven by the end of Ramadan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, visitor arrivals from long-haul markets such as the US and Canada increased by more than 80 percent year-on-year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HKTB said about 14.6 million visitor arrivals were recorded in the first four months of the year, which was double the figure from the same period in 2023.

    Interfering with HK's trade offices will backfire: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.

    Tourists from 8 mainland cities to get HK$200 vouchers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists hailing from eight mainland cities will be welcomed with HK$200 vouchers for restaurants and shops, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, the central government added eight new cities, including Urumqi, Hohhot and Heilongjiang to the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), allowing residents to travel to the SAR without joining a tour group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he expects visitors from the eight cities to provide a large boost to Hong Kong's tourism sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The IVS is the main source of tourists for Hong Kong. It contributed 60 percent of all mainland tourist arrivals last year. The eight cities come with large populations and they also have significant economic growth, with high spending power," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The eight cities are located in the north, northwest and northeast of China respectively. They are further away from Hong Kong, when compared with the other cities under the IVS. This will bring in a lot of overnight visitors, largely increase per capita spending, and revenues from tourism and related sectors will increase exponentially."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee said the authorities have a series of measures to attract more tourists, including the HK$200 vouchers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that a drone show at the weekend received rave reviews.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our purpose is to let locals and visitors feel the joy, when they participate in these activities. We hope to use activities to bring liveliness, and use liveliness to bring more money," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people were injured on Monday after a sightseeing helicopter to Mount Aso, an active volcano in Japan, needed to make an emergency landing due to an engine failure mid-flight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Japanese pilot and two Hong Kong tourists were on tour to the Aso Nakadake Crater in Kumamoto prefecture, when the incident occurred at noon during its return to base.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The helicopter's engine failed and an emergency landing was made on a grassy field near the mountainous area, where all three were sent conscious to hospital for treatment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Immigration Department has followed up on the case with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Consulate in Fukuoka to provide assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Tuesday said a secondary school teacher failed to return to Hong Kong after taking part in a four-day mainland study tour last week, following claims online that the educator was arrested for allegedly soliciting a prostitute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An online forum post suggested that a teacher of a subsidised school in Tin Shui Wai was picked up by mainland authorities while on a trip to Wuhan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said a mainland study tour for new teachers in Wuhan, which was held between May 8 and 11, wrapped up as scheduled, but it was notified that one member could not return to the SAR along with the group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Education Bureau attaches great importance to the discipline of participating teachers, and has required the school submit a report. The bureau will also comprehensively review relevant information and handle the case seriously. No further comments will be made at this stage," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The bureau will maintain close contact with the school and continue to follow up on the incident."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Education authorities also said teachers participating in mainland study tours must depart and return to Hong Kong as scheduled, and that they are reminded to be careful with their words and actions and to be law-abiding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Any cases of professional misconduct would be strictly followed up in accordance with the established mechanism, the bureau added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 RTHK has reached out to the school in question for comment.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The culture, sports and tourism minister, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said it was unacceptable that repeated mistakes were made by the chairwoman of the city's weightlifting and powerlifting body.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also called on Josephine Ip of the Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association to publicly address her mistakes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is unacceptable for the same mistakes to happen over and over. We hope that the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China can come up with a long-term solution so that similar incidents won't happen again," Yeung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because in both instances the chairwoman was at fault, she should explain to the public herself."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The association had apologised for a remark made by Ip during a competition on May 6. The event featured competitors from 13 countries along with the SAR and Chinese Taipei, and Ip said it had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Her remark drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The sports body explained the chairwoman made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence while giving a speech at the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On another occasion, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a "slip of the tongue".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said the administration would take appropriate action based on findings of the investigation to ensure people speaking on behalf of a sports association or the sector understood that every single word is very important.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, for its part, said it is reviewing the report submitted by the weightlifting and powerlifting body and would keep in contact with the government how to handle the matter.

<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

 Police on Monday said they arrested 34 people for allegedly operating electric bikes and scooters without a licence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The suspects, aged between 19 and 69, were also charged with offences such as driving unlicensed vehicles and using them on pavements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers added that they seized 34 electric bikes and scooters in various areas in the New Territories, such as Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Lok Ma Chau, in a two-day operation last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, senior inspector Ngai Siu-Cheong reminded people not to use unlicensed electric vehicles on public roads.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Anyone using unregistered and unlicensed electric vehicles on the road may be in violation of the Road Users' Code and other relevant laws. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty includes a fine of HK$10,000 and 12-month imprisonment," he said.

    Take care of ethnic minority Chinese tourists too: DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's tourism industry should learn to be more accommodating to ethnic minority travellers from the mainland, DAB lawmakers said on Monday, after the central government announced it was adding eight more cities to the individual visit scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From May 27, residents from eight more cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmaker Kennedy Wong pointed out the expansion meant more mainland visitors who are from ethnic minority communities coming to Hong Kong, including Mongolians, Zhuang people, and Hui people, and that the SAR had to be prepared to welcome them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong's tourism industry, and actually every one of us here, should be more accommodating and should be more understanding towards the minority travellers' needs. For example, for Muslims and for Mongolians, they have their eating habits and they also have their own culture," Wong said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Some of these minority travellers probably prefer their own languages. Apart from the ability to speak Putonghua, perhaps in some signage and some areas we also need to display their languages too."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Starry Lee, another DAB legislator and also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, urged officials to consider arranging more direct flights from those mainland cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There are currently direct flights from just four of these newly added cities – Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also renewed calls for Beijing to raise the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists from 5,000 to 30,000 yuan per person for each trip, while capping the amount at 200,000 yuan.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tik Chi-yuen called on officials to consult social workers about their proposal to reform the board. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752954_2_20240513142230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun said on Monday there was "nothing political" about him saying the governance of the statutory body overseeing social workers must be improved, and that the motivation was about raising the sector's professional standards.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last Friday, he wrote on social media accusing the Social Workers Registration Board of ignoring society's overall interests, damaging the professionalism and credibility of the sector by deviating from the spirit of the law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Specifically, he wrote that the board had renewed the licences or approved licence applications of people who'd committed serious offences in the past, while approving a social worker facing a rioting charge to join its disciplinary committee panel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said improvements must be made to implement the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Currently, the board has 15 members - eight of whom are elected, with six appointed and an official from the Social Welfare Department.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking to reporters, Sun didn't say whether the government plans to appoint more members to the board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said it would announce its reform package once it's ready.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun also dismissed an argument from the board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, that the minister had misunderstandings regarding how the board operates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's no misunderstanding - I have complete information about what's going on in the board," the minister said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said he hopes the board won't become a political battlefield.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tik said that if the government decides to go ahead and add more appointed members, he hoped it wouldn’t be because it wanted to gain the majority of the board and exert greater influence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The lawmaker also proposed that future appointed members be nominated or recommended by universities or professional bodies as they'd be considered impartial.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If you want to improve the registration board, it has to include the element of professionalism," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I suggest that the scholars from the universities or members of the professional body would increase the content and element of professionalism. I also imagine it will be more easily accepted by our professional sector."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tik hoped that officials would consult social workers regarding the reform proposal in future.

    Community living rooms to open in summer: Chris Sun
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Community living rooms to open in summer: Chris Sun" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752955_1_20240513142643.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Monday said he hopes the community living rooms in To Kwa Wan, Hung Hom and Nam Cheong would open by the end of the summer holidays, as part of efforts to help the newly identified 950,000 people for targeted poverty alleviation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a Legco panel meeting, Sun hoped the three facilities, aimed at providing support for grassroots families, would be able to serve residents in summer after undergoing outfitting works.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmaker Connie Lam asked whether there were plans to expand the shared-space project to more districts to help more people living in poor conditions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Apart from subdivided unit households, people living in cages or caged homes and cubicles also need these kind of community living rooms. There are a lot of such kinds of residential developments in Sha Tin, in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O, there are also subdivided units…Will the government expand the programme to other districts?” she asked.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In response, Sun said it’s not easy for the government to identify locations for these living rooms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Subdivided unit households are concentrated in urban areas and as a result it's difficult for the government to identify a venue to establish a community living room. That is why we have to rely on the business sector to identify such a venue for us,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the same meeting, lawmakers also questioned whether a new framework for poverty measurement could reflect the actual poverty situation and target underprivileged groups.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation. It will no longer use median household income to define poverty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said officials shouldn’t scrap the poverty line because it can keep the public informed about the impoverished population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Of course, the poverty line is contentious elsewhere in the world, but the poverty line works in two ways — we can tell the trend; we can see whether the impoverished population is growing or shrinking. The poverty line can also help us keep an eye on the performance of the government,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The welfare chief responded by saying the government had been putting a lot of resources into poverty alleviation through various social welfare programmes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday called on the government to clarify its revised rules on employment agencies, saying they were unclear.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The party's comments came after the Labour Department released a revised code of practice last week which aims to discourage domestic helpers from "job hopping", and to safeguard consumer rights.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan urged authorities to better stipulate the measure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The DAB requests the government to do more promotion and education for the agencies, especially as it is a new regulation for them," he said
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Could the government implement the instruction for the employer and the employee at the same time to make sure that they deeply understand the new regulation for the agency and the new agreement?"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ngan also called on the government to limit the borrowing capacity of foreign domestic helpers, as he and other DAB party members have received complaints from employers who are frustrated by lenders who pursue the money that helpers failed to pay back before departing from Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We request the government [to] make a financial credit database for those financial institutes to see [how much a] particular domestic helper borrowed," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We request the government to consider, [to] set an upper limit for the borrowing loan to the domestic helpers."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The DAB also suggested the government introduce a tax reduction scheme for people hiring foreign domestic helpers to reduce their burden on arranging health checks and training classes for the helpers.

    Divided views on direct flights for mainland visitors

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Representatives of the retail and hotel industries on Monday praised the move to boost Hong Kong's tourism sector by adding eight mainland cities to the individual visit scheme, but views were divided on whether direct flights from those cities were necessary.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From May 27, travellers from Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, Hohhot of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Harbin in Heilongjiang, Lhasa in Tibet, Lanzhou in Gansu, Xining in Qinghai, Yinchuan in Ningxia, and Urumqi in Xinjiang will be able to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis, instead of on tour groups.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Currently, there are direct flights from just four cities - Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alan Chan from the Miramar Group, which owns two hotels in the city, said travellers from further afield tend to spend more money, adding that tourists from the eight cities would be a big boost to the tourism sector here.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Visitors from those eight places will be the most wealthy people there...there are rich people in every city. For example, Shanxi doesn't have a very strong economy but there are bosses who own coal businesses there," the group's chief operations officer told an RTHK programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said with a new road which links Shenzhen airport and Shenzhen Bay opening next month, it would be convenient for mainland travellers to come to the SAR even if there are no direct flights.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Liberal Party legislator Peter Shiu, who represents the retail sector, said businesses here would get a greater boost if there are direct flights from all eight cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If tourists fly to Hong Kong directly, they would spend the night here during their trip. But if they fly to Shenzhen first and then come to Hong Kong, will they spend some time in Shenzhen before visiting us, or come to Hong Kong during the day and spend the night in Shenzhen?" he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have to think about this because usually tourists who stay the night here spend more money than those who don't."

    HA looks to make it easier to add new medicines

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) said it is seeking to streamline the process for adding new drugs to its registry, with a view to cut half the time needed to obtain the medicines.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Currently, drug companies write to clinical doctors directly in the application, and it takes around 10 months before a drug could be added to the HA's formulary.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The authority’s cluster services director, Simon Tang, said officials are trying to cut the red tape by having companies write to its headquarters, saving front-line doctors time and effort.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said patient groups and public doctors are among stakeholders officials will speak to, saying he hopes they can work out a proposal in the coming months.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We need to get our colleagues involved, and of course, another key stakeholder would be the pharmaceutical companies," Tang told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Through the streamlining, we're confident that the introduction of new drugs to the HA drug formulary can be shortened by half."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In November last year, the government introduced a new mechanism called "1+" for new drug registrations, for products treating severe diseases that are backed by local clinical data.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A new drug can now be registered in the SAR if just one drug regulatory authority in the world has approved it, rather than the previous two authorities, before local experts and regulators approve it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang said the HA had so far asked drug companies to try to register two drugs for treating cancer through the new mechanism, and said he understood that the government itself had received around 100 enquiries on the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that if the safety-proving clinical data for the new product is from the mainland or Hong Kong that could better ensure its effectiveness, because sometimes drugs approved in other continents may not have similar effects or side-effects for Asians.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The doctor noted that mainland drug regulators were one of four authorities added to the list of regulatory bodies in recent years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland students studying in Hong Kong have been urged to be vigilant as more of them are being targeted by phone scammers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Senior inspector Eddie Lam said there were 39 cases of mainland students falling victim to fake-official ruses in the first quarter of this year, up from 29 cases during the same period last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We discovered that scammers are targeting mainlanders who are studying in Hong Kong. We found that the number of reports by mainland students increased rapidly in April," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam said students, especially those from the mainland, should be extra vigilant.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From January to March, phone-scam victims lost a total of HK$789 million, almost four times more than the amount swindled during the same period last year.

    Hongkongers zone out as they compete to do nothing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Around a hundred Hongkongers who’ve mastered the art of doing nothing on Sunday gathered at the Cha Kwo Ling Promenade for a zoning out contest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The “Chill and Relax Festival” is jointly organised by the Development Bureau, the Harbourfront Commission and the Playground Association to raise awareness over the importance of mental health.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Participants were advised to stay still, and must not fall asleep or check their phones during the hour-long tournament. Their heart rates were measured regularly, and the person with the lowest and most stable heart rate would win.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kelvin, a laboratory worker, described the challenge as “a piece of cake”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “A whole hour is nothing. I normally can do nothing for a few hours daily, so I think it is not that challenging. Practice makes perfect,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Moris, a university student, said he was there to take a break from his studies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Just to relax, honestly… because I completed my semester. I think [I am here] just for this atmosphere because it shows some, it's a symbol for difference, like the traditional China culture or the Buddha,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Winnie, who joined the event with a group of hiking friends, said the occasion was perfect for Hongkongers to relax.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The majority of Hongkongers are always stressed out. So having some time to relax like this competition will be better,” she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The top three candidates got an Apple Watch, Airpods and a HK$500 shopping coupon respectively.

 Police on Sunday said a mainland man died after falling from Lion Rock.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers said they received a report at around noon, that the 37-year-old man was engaging in rock climbing before the fall.
 <br/>

 The Government Flying Service sent the man to Eastern Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee published a social media post, wishing all mothers joy and happiness on this special day." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752836_2_20240512142659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Celebrations are underway across Hong Kong on Sunday to mark Mother's Day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some restaurants RTHK spoke to said they logged a jump in business, as families flocked out to celebrate the day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Others, meanwhile, bought flowers as a show of love and appreciation for their mothers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "By giving her flowers, I would say thank you to my mom for taking care of me over the years and helping me," 11-year-old Alex said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some tourists said they were quite impressed with the festivities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mrs Wong, a tourist from Singapore, said people in Hong Kong appear to be more excited about Mother's Day compared to her home country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think the culture here in Hong Kong is pretty interesting. It's a bit different from Singapore, because I do see a lot of people carrying flowers around, so it's a bit different. So, I think they place more emphasis in Hong Kong,” she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another visitor from Shenzhen, Mr Tien, said he and his family are here for a day trip to mark the occasion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We come to Hong Kong for traveling and shopping, and brought our kid to walk around," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee wished all mothers joy and happiness on this special day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CE also posted a photo of himself and a colleague preparing flowers for "the two great mothers" in his life – namely his own mother and his wife – for the sacrifices they've made for his family.

    'Improve working conditions to retain public nurses'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="DAB lawmaker Edward Leung (right, second row) says the authorities need to improve the working conditions for nurses in the public sector.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong without taking a licensing exam has its drawbacks, a lawmaker and a nursing professor said on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead, they said it's more important to take away administrative work from existing local nurses at public hospitals and recognise their specialty to retain staff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Currently, non-locally trained nurses must pass the licensing examination administered by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong to be a qualified practitioner here.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But under the government’s proposal which has been submitted to Legco for scrutiny, those trained outside of the city could come through a special registration pathway and obtain a full license, without taking the exam, after having worked “satisfactorily and competently” during a specified period in the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marking the International Nurses Day, DAB lawmaker Edward Leung noted that the attrition rate for nurses in the public sector reached 9.5 percent in 2023-24, saying the government must improve working conditions to keep staff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said it’s important to reduce their administrative burden and ensure their pay is on par with the private sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said while the plan to admit non-locally trained nurses could help alleviate manpower shortage at public hospitals in the longer run, it could add to the workload of local nurses in the initial phase.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "When we invite them to Hong Kong, in the very first period, we have to assign local nurses to assist them on doing their jobs and providing services. For this period, we are drawing manpower to assist the non-local nurses," Leung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 William Li, vice-president of the Hong Kong Academy of Nursing, said the proposed special registration would only be a temporary measure to alleviate manpower shortage in the public sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The most important way is to offer recognition to those nurses who have specialty experience or specialty nursing qualification," Li said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Eventually, their job satisfaction should be improved and more nurses would be happy to stay at public hospitals."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li also said offering more training spots for aspiring nurses at local institutions could be another way to alleviate manpower shortage.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said an expansion of the individual travellers scheme will bring more overnight tourists to the SAR, adding that more will be done to boost spending and attract visitors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He made the remarks a day after Beijing announced that people from eight more mainland cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This brings the total number of cities under the solo travel scheme to 59.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will stimulate the economy and improve cultural ties between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The SAR government and residents are deeply grateful to the central government for their support of Hong Kong. The move will encourage more visitors to stay overnight, boosting the local catering, retail, and hotel sectors," he wrote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This will help our economy and improve the cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The finance chief also vowed to do more to lure talent to the city, and bring in more foreign capital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite the external challenges like rising geopolitical tensions and a high interest rate environment, Chan said he’s confident that Hong Kong’s economy will continue to expand with the staunch backing of the central authorities.

    'Glory to HK' ban helps define red line: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said an injunction over the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong" helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on a radio programme days after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the court has made it very clear what is allowed and what’s not.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The purpose of this injunction was made very clear by the court. Using this song to incite seditious acts is illegal. It will definitely increase the public's awareness of this behaviour. What are the benefits? They are to provide a stronger deterrence and a prevention, and to make everyone understand what can and can't be done," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The justice chief said authorities had asked internet service providers such as Google to take down the song and are awaiting their response, adding that Google had said earlier that it would remove the song upon a court order.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I believe everyone is very anxious and hope that [the internet service providers] will take actual action to respond as quickly as possible. Do they really follow the company’s policy [to align with court orders]? Do they really keep their word?" he questioned.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Lam said he hopes to see Hong Kong develop into a “food court” for legal services, catering not only for the needs of international companies, but also of grassroots citizens.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The justice minister added that officials will continue to boost the city’s role as a mediation and arbitration centre.

    Weightlifting body apologises over chairwoman remarks

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association says chairwoman Josephine Ip will be more cautious to ensure similar incidents won't happen again." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752825_1_20240512105507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's weightlifting and powerlifting body has apologised for an earlier remark made by its chairwoman which the government said was a suspected violation of the one-China principle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association also said Josephine Ip made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence when giving a speech on May 6.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup, Ip mentioned that the event, which featured competitors from the SAR and Chinese Taipei, had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Her remarks drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In response, the sports body explained that there were initially competitors from 16 countries and regions, but ultimately only representatives from 13 nations and two regions participated in the event.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "During her speech, chairwoman Ip found that the script did not match the actual number of participating teams. She also felt that the sentence was too long. So she simplified the sentence to 'this time, we have lifters and officials from 13 countries'," the association said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "She mistakenly omitted 'regions' and created misunderstanding. This was a serious oversight."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The association also said the speech did not mean to imply "Hong Kong independence", and that it firmly supports and upholds the Basic Law and the one-China principle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The chairwoman will be more cautious and will review public speeches before giving them to ensure similar incidents won't happen again, the association added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The powerlifting and weightlifting association has submitted a report to the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China on Saturday.
