<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday warned of potential traffic jams at boundary checkpoints near the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, as scores of travellers are expected to head north for the July 1 long weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently SAR motorists planning to travel to Macau or Zhuhai must make reservations in advance. All northbound slots for Saturday have been snapped up, while limited places are available for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have been urged to address bottlenecks near the Zhuhai checkpoint, after travellers heading back to the SAR were stuck for hours on Tuen Mun Festival earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it has installed cameras so that people can check out the traffic condition at the Hong Kong port's vehicle clearance plaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It anticipates northbound traffic to peak on Saturday, while most will return on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The department will closely monitor the traffic conditions at all ports, and strengthen the dissemination of the latest traffic information to citizens who use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to travel between the three places," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Motorists have been urged to plan their return trip ahead, and travel in off-peak hours "as far as possible".

    Mixed reactions to increase in duty-free allowance

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some mainland tourists say they hope the duty-free allowance can be increased further. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759482_1_20240628175924.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There have been mixed reactions to an increase in the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau, with some welcoming the move and others saying it doesn't go far enough.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Beijing announced that it will increase the allowance from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Tsim Sha Tsui, a mainland tourist said he hopes to see the allowance increased further because he normally spends around 100,000 yuan in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope it can be raised to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, because women’s bags usually cost around that. Also, large jewellery and cosmetics items almost always cost more than ten thousand dollars," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Central, a visitor from Shenzhen said he will spend more in the SAR after the measure takes effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the original limit of 5,000 yuan is not enough because many electronic products cost more than 5,000 yuan... This adjustment will greatly stimulate mainland consumers' purchasing power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shanghai tourist said the increase won't make a difference to him, because he's only in Hong Kong to watch a concert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't really affect me because I don't buy much in Hong Kong. And now prices in Hong Kong are probably similar to the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Retail Management Association said the measure is an important step forward and it hopes the SAR government will continue to pay attention to the needs and development of the industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new promenade was opened in Kennedy Town on Friday, with officials touting it as an excellent area for people to take photos of Victoria Harbour and the Tsing Ma Bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony, Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said the 280-metre-long promenade connecting Cadogan Street and Sai Ning Street provides more space for events, and will attract visitors to the neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that this new promenade will become an excellent resting place where everyone can come to the seaside for walks and picnics with family and friends. Organisers can also hold various youth activities, exhibitions and markets here to make the atmosphere more harmonious and to make the economy more prosperous in the coming days," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Central and Western District Office will also utilise the space to hold more activities to add life and vitality to the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said the Cadogan Street Promenade will be accessible 24 hours a day and is equipped with shaded seating areas.

 Competition climbing only made its debut at the last Olympics in Tokyo, and the chances of Hong Kong climbers making it to Paris this summer are slim.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, home-grown climber Shoji Chan told RTHK he's taking things in his stride, and believes he will eventually make it to the Olympics one day.

    'Beijing's commitment to Hong Kong never changes'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official has reiterated the central government's commitment to maintaining the "One Country, Two Systems" governing principle for Hong Kong, while urging the city to capitalise on its unique advantages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, the director of Beijing's liaison office, on Friday described the territory's prosperity and stability as "rock solid", and said the rule of law, business environment, as well as democracy and freedom in the SAR, remain unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Shortly after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration 40 years ago, British-Hong Kong authorities unilaterally made changes to many of their promises. The last governor, Chris Patten, arbitrarily laid 'political landmines' for Hong Kong," Zheng told a Legislative Council luncheon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the central government's commitment has never changed, and it has offered extreme care for Hong Kong.".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told lawmakers that the city has "risen from the ashes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The central government fully supports Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is rapidly advancing from stability to prosperity. The biggest change is that Hong Kong has transformed from a humiliating colony run by outsiders to the apple of the country's eye," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong serves as the bridge for the world to understand China, enter China, and shake hands with China... [Integrating into the country] will not marginalise Hong Kong, or even 'mainlandise' the city. Instead, it will further strengthen Hong Kong's status and advantages, and have better achievements."

    'Higher duty-free limit will boost HK retail'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Politicians and industry representatives on Friday welcomed Beijing's move to raise the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities announced that the limit will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, told reporters that the move will boost the city's retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that with this initiative, tourists from the mainland can shop more freely and it can benefit our various industries, especially the retail industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that local authorities have to do their part to make the SAR a more attractive place for tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the two sessions in Beijing in March, delegates to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) signed a petition asking for the duty-free allowance to be increased to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, a CPPCC Standing Committee member, said the increase announced is a "good beginning", even though it's lower than the amount proposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This arrangement is exclusive. This arrangement is fair to both parties, and this arrangement can be adjusted going forward. And at the same time, it will be a boost to our retail industry and to our tourism industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation also welcomed Beijing's move, adding that the SAR government can work with malls to promote Hong Kong as a "shopping paradise".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, said it will hand out 500,000 sets of offers worth more than HK$100 million to overnight visitors to Hong Kong starting from July 11, including sightseeing, transport, dining and consumption discounts.

    Investment vehicle has its own unique functions: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city's government-owned investment vehicle aims to forge a more competitive tech-innovation ecosystem in the SAR, as he highlighted its differences with Singapore's sovereign investment arm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has been considered by some as a local version of Temasek in Singapore, Chan said the two bodies are “completely different” in an interview marking two years of the current administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s like comparing apples and oranges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two goals of the HKIC are to generate appropriate financial returns, and to help boost the innovation and technology industries and create a local ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Other than conducting its own investments, a more important [function of the firm] is that it will serve as a guide for other long-term and sovereign wealth funds and to invest in certain sectors together... to create a domino effect and attract HK$100 billion, or HK$200 billion or even HK$300 billion,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the government investment vehicle, which was set up two years ago and manages some HK$62 billion in assets, is still operating at an initial stage with only two deals signed so far, and authorities will reveal more details regarding projects with the release of its yearly report later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKIC signed deals with tech firms SmartMore and BioMap InnoHub earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the local property market, Chan said it remains stable despite a drop in prices in May, snapping a two-month increase following the removal of all cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid fluctuations in the residential property prices because they're affected by multiple factors, including interest rates as well as supply and demand. They're also affected by how people perceive the outlook of the property market and the city’s economic situation, job market, etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe the most important thing for the government is to maintain a healthy development of the property market, in other words, not to have major fluctuations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary added the government will keep ramping up land supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also expressed confidence towards the SAR economy in the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the economy was in its recovery stage in the first six months of 2024 and was still facing challenges, a series of mega events in the next six months will further boost local economic activity.

 Beijing on Friday announced that the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People who buy goods at duty-free stores at border crossings will continue to get an extra allowance of 3,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The change will take effect on July 1 at Lo Wu, Futian, Shenzhen Bay, West Kowloon Station, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Gongbei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The policy will be implemented at all border crossings from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the new arrangements would raise local spending by HK$8.8 billion to HK$17.6 billion and generate added value of about HK$2.7 billion to HK$5.4 billion to the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee welcomed the move, saying it shows the central government's support for Hong Kong's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new measure will enhance the shopping experience for mainland resident visitors in Hong Kong and allow them greater flexibility when shopping, which is beneficial for Hong Kong in attracting more visitors and boosting the development of diversified tourism," he said.

    Hong Kong condemns Taiwan over travel warning

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has condemned Taiwan for issuing a travel alert for Hong Kong, saying the island had smeared the city and its national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said the issuing of an "orange" alert by the Taiwan authorities warning residents against travelling to the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau was a “political manoeuvre with fact-twisting smears and slanders exposing malicious intentions.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan had said the alert -- its second highest – was needed because the risk of travelling to Hong Kong had risen following the implementation of the National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR government spokesman countered that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty – just like it is in many common law jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Taiwan authorities turned a blind eye to the fact, made exaggerated remarks, maliciously smeared and demonised the NSL and the SNSO, completely unmasking its double standards."

  <br/>
  The spokesman added that ordinary travellers – including those from Taiwan --  would not unwittingly violate the law, noting that national security offences target only an extremely small minority who endanger national security and the safety of Hong Kong.

    HA chair upset about lengthy drug prescription

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hospital Authority (HA), Henry Fan, said on Thursday that he finds it unacceptable that a public hospital doctor recently prescribed more than 400 days' worth of psychiatric medication to a patient.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eastern Hospital earlier said that it is undesirable for patients to be given medicine for a long period of time, after a private doctor wrote about the case of the psychiatric patient on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital said the patient, who had been seeing a private doctor, was admitted in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before being discharged, a doctor prescribed him the medication to make sure he would have a sufficient supply should he postpone future appointments, the hospital said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the HA's board meeting, Fan said the matter will be subject to a review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this case, as you all know, right now the clinical decisions must be made by the doctor on duty. So our review is not necessarily to hold someone accountable or something," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But rather, we want to give more guidelines to doctors, for them to know what to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan noted there is also an ongoing review looking at prescribing patients at outpatient clinics with no more than 16 weeks' worth of drugs, saying officials will consider this latest case together with that review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the government ordered a comprehensive, systemic review at the HA, following a spate of medical blunders and issues with equipment at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan said the authority has shortlisted several people with no links to the authority to form an independent committee for the review.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said retail sales will improve, although challenges remain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony for the Hong Kong Shopping Festival, Chan cited changes in consumption patterns of tourists and local residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the consumption patterns of the public and visitors have changed this year, the retail industry faces many challenges," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The good news is that the job market is still doing quite well, and there's still spending demand. As long as we change our approach, adjust our positioning, update strategies, link up with new demand and create consumption trigger points, business will certainly come back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse, said the retail sector is hosting the shopping festival between July 1 and August 31 to boost sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this programme is going to help, at least bringing up the atmosphere to encourage our consumers to go to our retail shops to make purchases," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau Tse added that more than 5,000 retailers will take part in the festival, offering freebies and concessions worth HK$1.2 billion.

    Prolonged hot spell set to break records

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hot spell which has scorched Hong Kong for a week will likely continue into the weekend, potentially breaking the record for the city's longest heatwave since a warning system was introduced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The observatory said on Thursday that under the influence of a subtropical ridge, it will remain very hot on Friday and Saturday, with a high of 35 degrees Celsius or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means the Very Hot Weather Warning, which has been in place since last Thursday, could be extended for another two days or longer. The warning is issued when the temperature hits 33 degrees or higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current heatwave record was set in 2016, when the warning was in force for nine consecutive days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting assistant director at the observatory Cheng Yuen-chung warned the worst could be yet to come, as July is usually the SAR's hottest month of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said that people should brace for hotter summers than in previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the background of global warming, we expect the temperature in the summer to rise compared to the past," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The general public should take extra precautions against heatstroke."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association, meanwhile, urged elderly people to take hot weather warnings seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Elderly people] are particularly vulnerable to hot weather. If you have symptoms ... like dizziness, nausea, extreme tiredness or a feeling of dehydration, please rest and seek help immediately," said the association's Chief Executive Officer, Maura Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also encouraged everyone to keep an eye on senior citizens, especially those who live alone.

    HKU researchers develop model for anti-ageing products

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at the University of Hong Kong on Thursday said they have created a model that has the potential to speed up the development of anti-ageing products and drugs to combat age-related diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One of the researchers, Dr Cherie Lee, said that as Hong Kong's population ages, the need for age-related medical care will also increase, leading to an urgent need for research into anti-ageing methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past, studies of the ageing process have had to rely on either animal ageing models or cell lines, neither of which are accurate due to differences in human physiology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The research team, led by Professor of Biomedical Sciences Liu Pengtao, says it has developed a new cellular system that can be used to rapidly discover anti-ageing molecules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say this will enable researchers to understand the mechanisms of ageing in a controlled environment and to accurately observe the key features of ageing, thereby improving human health and longevity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu said this can not only open the door to further research, such as the discovery of ageing molecules or clinical research, but also to the development of drugs for age-related diseases.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has announced the postponement of a joint co-operation conference between Hong Kong and Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The one-day meeting, which Chief Executive John Lee was expected to attend in Guangzhou, was originally scheduled to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 24th Plenary of the Hong Kong/Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference originally scheduled to take place in Guangzhou today (June 27) will be postponed to July as agreed by both the Guangdong and Hong Kong sides. The official date will be announced in due course," a government statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No reason was given for the postponement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee was planning to lead a government delegation to the mainland city and co-chair the plenary with the governor of Guangdong, Wang Weizhong, to discuss enhanced co-operation in areas such as innovation and technology, finance, healthcare, cross-boundary transport and trade.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung says the government aims to establish a regulatory framework for online ride-hailing platforms within the next three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Ming Pao newspaper, Lam said that next month the authorities will outline the legal responsibilities that such platforms must meet to obtain a licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam expressed confidence that the government will resolve complaints about such services from the taxi sector within its current term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transport minister also said the government will reduce tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of it in May next year. Currently, the fee for private cars is HK$58.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said it's hoped that lower tolls at the tunnel will divert traffic from the congested Tuen Mun Road and Tolo Highway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lam said the government will consider building a fourth cross-harbour tunnel when planning the construction of the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands. The islands, off Lantau, are expected to be completed by 2034.

    HK can guard against cyberattacks: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The innovation and technology chief has reassured the public that Hong Kong has the capacity to handle cybersecurity threats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Dong was speaking after a string of recent ransomware attacks on government departments and public bodies, with some leading to data leaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking two years of the current administration, Sun said government bureaus and departments will be asked to conduct regular inspection to guard against hackers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for innovation, technology and industry also noted that the problem was not confined to the SAR, but a global one as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of cyberattacks has been trending upwards. Judging from the data, the attacks are mainly from outside Hong Kong," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, this is also a global trend, so we must strengthen our monitoring work in this regard. Generally speaking, Hong Kong's cybersecurity is still under control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said the administration is dedicated to building an "international data park" in the Northern Metropolis, with consultations under way on the development at Sandy Ridge near Lo Wu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are already two hectares of levelled land, which would be released for use. On top of this two-hectare site, we are considering providing more opportunities to the industry, for example in the surrounding hillsides and slopes we can provide about more than 10 hectares of land," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Developers have until the end of July to express their interest before authorities make the plots available through means other than tendering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also expressed confidence that the SAR will continue to contribute to the country's space endeavours, thanks to its pool of talent in aerospace, after the selection of a Hong Kong resident as a payload specialist in the national space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the minister commented on a recent Legislative Council panel meeting during which he became visibly emotional while thanking lawmakers for their support for the government's innovation and technology initiatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lawmakers always ask tough questions, but in the end, everyone gave their full support. I was moved by the Legislative Council's unconditional support, not just to me but also to the entire development of innovation and technology," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So in the end, I got a bit emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said many people had questions about innovation and technology two years ago, but through government efforts, there's now a consensus in society on the issue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The police said they have arrested a man suspected of trying to kill his wife and three daughters by burning charcoal at a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspect was detained at a guesthouse in Mong Kok on Wednesday evening and is accused of attempted murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours earlier, officers received a report from the man's wife saying that she and the three girls, aged between 13 and 16, were feeling dizzy due to smoke in a flat in Shan King Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were taken to hospital and are said to be in satisfactory condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they suspect the woman's husband left the flat after setting the charcoal alight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a press briefing, Sum Ho-min, chief crime inspector of Tuen Mun division, said officers believe the suspect was having financial problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the Social Welfare Department will follow up on the case.

 Four universities in Hong Kong have been ranked among the world’s top 100 institutions in the latest annual global ranking compiled by US News and World Report.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese University of Hong Kong was rated as the 42nd best university in the world – top in the SAR. The University of Hong Kong followed close behind in the 44th position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Polytechnic University jumped 33 places from its position last year to 67th – third in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PolyU's civil engineering department, meanwhile, was ranked second in the world for that field – behind only Tongji University in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, Harvard University reaffirmed its position as the world's number one institution, while Tsinghua University emerged as China's leading university, ranked 16th in the globe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US News and World Report's 2024-2025 Best Global Universities Rankings assessed 2,250 institutions worldwide, taking into account various indicators such as academic research performance, global reputation and regional standing.

 Police on Wednesday said they are searching for a man suspected of trying to kill his wife and three daughters by burning charcoal at a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers received a report from the man's wife at about 6am saying that she and the girls were feeling dizzy due to smoke in a flat in Shan King Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman and her three daughters, aged between 13 and 16, were taken to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>

    Customs seize counterfeit sports items worth HK$50m

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said they have seized more than 60,000 sports items, including footballs, jerseys and footwear, during a three-week operation combating counterfeit goods.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hauls, worth more than HK$50 million in total, led to the arrests of nine people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting head of customs' intellectual property investigation bureau, Peggy Tam, said the market was flooded with merchandise in the run-up to international sports events such as the Paris Olympics, and criminals made use of this to push out their counterfeit goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam urged people to only buy products from shops with a good reputation, warning that counterfeit items sold online are often of poor quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisional commander So Kim-fai from the bureau said people buying sports jerseys should pay attention to various details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly, the material used for counterfeit jerseys is not breathable. Secondly, some hang tags of counterfeit jerseys do not have a laser tag. Thirdly, the embroidery on counterfeit jerseys is cruder, with blurrier text. The embroidery on genuine jerseys is much clearer and more sophisticated," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some genuine jerseys also feature special designs on, for example, the sleeves, that counterfeit jerseys don't have."

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759119_1_20240626160129.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong official on Wednesday scotched rumours that the East Rail Line will be extended into Shenzhen, with a "co-location" immigration clearance arrangement put in place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media reports earlier this year cited a mainland official as saying such a plan could be on the cards, as the Shenzhen side of the Lo Wu crossing is being redeveloped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But asked about the reports in Legco, Security Secretary Chris Tang said there is no plan to extend the MTR line into the Luohu district of Shenzhen, or bring in a co-location arrangement like the one in place for high-speed rail passengers at West Kowloon Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the government understands that Shenzhen authorities will soon carry out modification works on their side of the border crossing to "eliminate safety hazards, improve the port's functions, and upgrade the inspection facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the work to be carried out will not change the overall layout of the facilities and once completed, the time for immigration clearance on the Hong Kong side will not be affected.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Wednesday said a series of measures by the Hospital Authority (HA) to train and retain medical staff has been successful, with more doctors serving in the public sector and a drop in the resignation rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in the Legislative Council, Lo said the number of doctors increased by 260 in the 2023-24 year compared to the year before, while the resignation rate dropped to 5.2 percent, from 8.1 percent in 2021-22.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also told lawmakers that the hiring of medical practitioners from outside Hong Kong is going well, with 144 non-locally trained doctors working for the authority as of the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our estimation, because of our enhanced efforts to recruit non-locally trained doctors, by the end of this year we expect 250 non-locally trained doctors joining the HA to alleviate the burden on the public healthcare system," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the government announced a new batch of recognised medical qualifications under the Medical Registration Ordinance, involving 28 courses at 20 non-local universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four of the universities are on the mainland – Capital Medical University, Fudan University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Sun Yat-sen University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The others are in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the ordinance, non-locally trained doctors who have a recognised medical qualification can apply for special registration to practise in Hong Kong.

    New 3D scanners to speed up airport luggage checks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some people flying out of Hong Kong won't need to take out their electronic devices and liquids during security checks from July 2, as new CT X-ray machines are introduced at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new machines to check luggage will first be used at four of the 35 security screening lanes for departures from Terminal 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “By using a CT X-ray machine it can provide a 3D image to the screener. With the 3D image, the screener can help [security personnel] to make a better and quicker decision on whether the screened package is okay to pass through the screening process,” said executive director of airport operations Steven Yiu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can increase the hourly throughput from the current 240 to 360 [people]. So this is almost a 50 percent increase in capacity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New full-body scanners will also be introduced in the lanes with the new CT X-ray machines, for those who set off the metal detectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Normally, we require the passenger to go through the metal detector. When he/she triggers the alarm, the security operator will use the hand-held screener to do a second-tier check,” Yiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now, we'll replace it with a full-body scanner, reducing the contact between the person and our security officer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said they will gradually replace all the older X-ray machines and install the new full-body scanners in all security lanes in Terminal 1 departures as well as in transit areas, as part of a project costing more than HK$800 million.

    Over 2,000 restaurants to offer July 1 discounts

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 2,000 food outlets and stores across Hong Kong will offer discounts to celebrate July 1, with a lawmaker stressing that the concessions are not aimed at boosting business.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 29 percent discount will apply to designated menu items under the initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shops that have agreed to take part include convenience stores and major chains like Maxim's, Cafe de Coral and Tai Hing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not doing this to increase our sales. This is part of a celebration," said catering sector lawmaker Tommy Chueng on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is not how much business we do. It is contributing so that everybody will be happy come July 1 when you go out to eat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawmaker also said that asking eateries to give an across-the-board discount would discourage them from offering cheaper food and drink items.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to take 29 percent off your bill and be able to pay rent, your salaries and all your food costs," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, chairman of the Quality Tourism Services Association, said the discounts are coming at a good time, because more mainland residents are now able to travel to the SAR through the Individual Visit Scheme.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health chief Lo Chung-mau says that around 60 percent of patients who seek accident and emergency services at public hospitals are classified as semi- or non-urgent cases. Photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759084_1_20240626123001.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau says an ongoing review of accident and emergency charges at public hospitals is looking at how to focus resources on those patients who are most in need.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan suggested in January that the fees for various public services should be increased to offset the government's deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said about 60 percent, or 1.3 million, A&E visits each year are classified as semi-urgent or non-urgent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With each patient costing HK$2,400 on average, that means the government is spending HK$2 billion annually on patients who do not have a genuine need for emergency services, the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The money spent at public hospitals is funded by taxpayers, so we need to make sure it is used prudently," Lo told reporters in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I need to point out that the government is currently subsidising almost 97 percent of costs at public hospitals. That means users are paying less than four percent of the actual bill for their services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo emphasised that the government will not scale back healthcare funding, and said some patients may enjoy reduced fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities are also identifying groups who require more financial resistance, such as cancer patients who fork out hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for medication, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, Lo pledged to conduct a "systemic" review after a string of medical incidents at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He floated some possible solutions, including strengthening an incentive and penalty mechanism for staff, and boosting accountability among management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Having someone step down does not mean the problem is solved," he said, adding that resignations could further exacerbate the manpower shortage at public hospitals.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell by 1.2 percent in May, according to official data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drop followed two consecutive months of increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices in May were 12.7 percent lower than the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed a one percent increase in rental prices, which reached a four-and-a-half year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the first time home prices have reported a decrease since Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, the director of real estate consultancy Knight Frank, said the effects of the end of the "spicy" measures have now worn off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There seems to be no positive factors apart from the cooling measures news. Because currently the home prices are still being impacted by two negative factors," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first one is the high interest rate environment and the second one is the ample supply for new units. As long as these two factors continue to impact the market, it will stop the home prices from rebounding quickly."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Secretary for Security Chris Tang says the proposed legislative framework does not target individuals but large organisations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759011_1_20240625212402.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday proposed new legislation to enhance cybersecurity of critical infrastructures such as banks, railway systems and electricity suppliers, with operators required to report cybersecurity incidents and those who fail to comply fined up to HK$5 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a paper submitted to the Legislative Council by the Security Bureau, critical infrastructures are "facilities that are necessary for the maintenance of normal functioning of the Hong Kong society".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two major categories of critical infrastructures. The first covers facilities delivering "essential services" in eight sectors, namely energy, information technology, banking and financial services, land transport, air transport, maritime, healthcare services, as well as communications and broadcasting. The second includes "other infrastructures for maintaining important societal and economic activities", such as major sports and performance venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A new commissioner's office under the Security Bureau will be set up to monitor operators and follow up on non-compliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed legislative framework, operators are required to set up a computer system security management unit, conduct a security risk assessment at least once every year and an independent security audit at least once every two years, and report serious security incidents within two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penalties ranging from HK$500,000 to HK$5 million will apply to organisations that fail to comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang said the proposal does not target individuals but large organisations, adding that it will not infringe people's freedom to use the internet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers will discuss the proposal in a security panel meeting on July 2, followed by a consultation period that will last for a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it hopes to table the bill to Legco by the end of this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year’s book fair said on Tuesday that they hope to attract visitors from around the world by showcasing props and manuscripts from popular Hong Kong movies and dramas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fair's theme this time will be film and television literature and the event will feature AI-generated movie images, as well as talks by the author of a book on the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government has been very active in promoting mega events and hoping to attract a lot of tourists as well as Greater Bay Area citizens to Hong Kong. So the book fair, I think we play a part in it,” said Sophia Chong, deputy executive director of the Trade Development Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s quite attractive in getting all the families and also the Greater Bay Area fans and even from Southeast Asia to come to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chong also said all exhibitors are aware of the need to comply with laws relating to national security, as well as other regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have been asking our exhibitors to observe the rules and regulations of the Hong Kong Book Fair… They have been very observant in observing all these rules and regulations and also the rules in Hong Kong, including the [National Security Law] as well as the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event, at the Convention and Exhibition Centre, will run from July 17 to July 23, with the Sports and Leisure Expo and the World of Snacks taking place at the venue at the same time.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Disney's managing director Michael Moriarty (second from right) says the resort's three hotels are also recovering well. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758982_1_20240625165135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Tuesday said it achieved record-breaking earnings in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the opening of its "World of Frozen" attraction last November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The first quarter of 2024 was our most successful quarter ever, achieving record-level revenues, [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization] and net income. These results are our continued focus on creating the best place to work for our amazing cast members in the power of Disney brand and franchises," said the resort's managing director Michael Moriarty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disneyland also noted its net loss had shrunk by 83 percent to HK$356 million in the fiscal year of October 2022 to September 2023 while year-on-year revenue grew by 156 percent to HK$5.7 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park attributed the boost to a strong rebound in both local and non-local travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total attendance last year grew by 87 percent to 6.4 million with the number of local visitors reaching a record-high, the company said, and a rebound in mainland China visitors was particularly strong, but there was also growth in visitor numbers from Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disneyland had operated at a loss for nine fiscal years in a row, but Moriarty highlighted that the park actually turned profitable if the number was calculated from January to December 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we look at the fiscal year, I think you have to really look at it in two ways - there’s a lot of old news in there, and our losses that we suffered as a result of Covid are very similar to those during the previous years during Covid that everyone suffered through,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But as soon as the masks came off, our business took off. And literally, immediately out of the gate, we started to out-pace the market's recovery. And that's when we really started to turn profitable right away, in the summer of last fiscal year.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that demand for the resort’s three hotels was also recovering strongly, with a more than 90 percent booking rate observed in the first three months of 2024.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bernadette Linn said the government has always played the gatekeeping role when it comes to harbourfront protection." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758974_1_20240625162749.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Tuesday criticised a concern group for claiming that proposed changes to harbour protection laws would strip the courts of the power to adjudicate on controversies involving reclamation projects in Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Society for Protection of the Harbour had argued that legal changes aimed at making it easier for smaller reclamation projects to be carried out will shift gatekeeping powers from the courts to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Linn told lawmakers at a development panel meeting that such gatekeeping has always been carried out by the government and if the legal amendments are approved, people will still be able to challenge decisions by way of a judicial review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary said the default position will continue to be that large-scale reclamation in the harbour is banned unless there is an overriding public need for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the Executive Council makes a decision on such a project, the public would have a chance to have their say on the matter, Linn added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary would make decisions on whether to allow smaller projects, or those that are only temporary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn stressed that the government has no plans to carry out large-scale reclamation in Victoria Harbour for housing, commercial or industrial developments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of the amendment is to improve harbourfront connectivity, enhance harbourfront areas for public enjoyment, or strengthen functions the harbour ought to have," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All the councillors at the meeting expressed their support for the proposed changes, with several saying they hope more facilities will be approved around the harbour to improve people's livelihoods.

 National security police on Tuesday charged a man with writing words with seditious intention on the back of bus seats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said the writing, found on public buses in March and April, provoked hatred towards the central authorities and the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of "doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention", contravening Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was also charged with destroying or damaging property.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A DAB lawmaker on Tuesday called on the government to beautify Sham Shui Po, to attract more visitors to the district.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Vincent Cheng, who represents the Kowloon West geographical constituency, said businesses in Sham Shui Po are struggling to survive as more Hongkongers head north for tourism and shopping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said the government should begin with enhancing the appeal of Apliu Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apliu Street is one of the really historical streets. It's full of different kinds of electricity products, especially the old cameras, the old CDs, a lot of different musical stuff over there. So we do think there are a lot of visitors going around there every day. So we do think there's a good attraction," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, the government can have some promotion or revamp to make sure that everyone knows that Apliu Street is really good for the tourists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also suggested installing figures of the district's mascot, known as "Sham Duck", and renovating the "pai dong" hawker stalls in the area.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the upcoming July 1 holiday is a special day that people should celebrate freely, while warning of potential "undesirable activities".
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also told reporters that he believed people would cherish the current safe and stable situation in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that people will celebrate July 1 happily. At the same time, we have to stay vigilant against undesirable activities taking place, say for example, activities that hijack this important date," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have stability, our security is safeguarded. I'm sure people will look forward to the celebrations. Police will take into account the situation and make arrangements as necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the absence of demonstrations on July 1, the chief executive said there are many ways and channels for people to express their opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lee is set to lead a delegation of principal officials to Guangzhou on Thursday for an annual conference, with discussions on past achievements and future cooperation in areas such as innovation and technology, finance, and healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong would help contribute to the high-quality development of the Greater Bay Area, adding there were unlimited opportunities for both sides.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong airport officials must make improvements and ensure a glitch that affected many passengers over the weekend does not happen again, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, a computer malfunction paralysed real-time flight information updates on the airport's display screens, as well as on digital platforms, for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said although no flights had to be cancelled, the glitch affected a lot of passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that transport authorities immediately met Airport Authority management regarding the incident, and that airport bosses had been told to submit a detailed report to prevent similar incidents from happening in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have asked the Airport Authority to conduct a comprehensive review of the system, including its backup system, to upgrade its capacity in activating the system and to review its risk management measures amid the completion of the third runway system," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong International Airport is an international aviation hub. It is of paramount importance to provide high-quality and stable services to passengers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Preliminary findings showed there were issues with activating the authority's backup system following the glitch.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that power company CLP must get to the bottom of a series of power outages in recent months, adding that he's highly concerned about the matter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee said before the weekly Executive Council meeting that CLP needs to improve in a number of areas to ensure a stable and reliable power supply, which he stressed is important to the people and the territory's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is necessary for CLP to identify the root causes of the problems, make fundamental improvements to reduce the chance of similar incidents in the future," the CE told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some systems may have been running for a long time, so it is important that they're always well-maintained, then there'll be a good system to ensure that periodic checks take place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said it is essential for the company to deploy more manpower to improve its response to emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that officials will follow up on CLP's plans to enhance its overall power supply system capabilities and reduce the risks brought by adverse weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm had said that a voltage dip in the early hours of Sunday may have been caused by the weather.

    HK to host world youth summit in August: Mak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alice Mak says August's youth summit will provide a platform for meaningful exchanges between people from all over the world. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758913_1_20240625105757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, said a summit would be held in August to provide an opportunity for young people from different places to come together and exchange ideas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, Mak said more than 1,000 youth leaders and speakers from different parts of the world, including the mainland, would be invited to the Youth Development Summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said young people attending the event could understand global development trends and plan their future effectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main objective is to create a platform where people from different places can meet our outstanding young people. They can learn about the remarkable qualities and potential of our youth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In addition, our young friends in Hong Kong will have the opportunity to interact with people from other cities and meet various youth leaders. This will enable them to broaden their horizons and foster more meaningful exchanges".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said the government was working well with district councils and care teams to provide comprehensive support to people living in different areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said district councillors and care teams regularly visit residents to understand their needs and find solutions to problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing the example of a deadly fire in Jordan in April, Mak said that without the cooperation between care teams and district councils, the government would not have been able to provide services to affected residents as efficiently and effectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have more partners in the districts. We are no longer relying on the government's resources and capacity alone."

    <![CDATA[<img alt='A government spokesman said: "We vehemently oppose and firmly reject the unfounded and false remarks in the Report against the situation in Hong Kong." Photo: RTHK' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758874_1_20240625052908.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has hit back at what it calls "unsubstantiated remarks" from the US State Department in its latest Trafficking in Persons Report, which said Hong Kong was actively being used by syndicates as a destination or transit point for human trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR government said it vehemently opposed and firmly rejected what it called unfounded and false remarks in the report about the situation in Hong Kong. The SAR statement said trafficking in persons was never a prevalent problem in the city, and there had never been any sign that Hong Kong was actively used by syndicates to conduct such activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the rating of Hong Kong as Tier 2 on its Watch List was "unfair, misconceived, and not substantiated by facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government said it had been making proactive and multi-pronged efforts in the fight against trafficking in persons, and had injected an enormous amount of resources into combating the issue, as well as enhancing protection for foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong. It said the government spared no effort in conducting initial screenings for all persons vulnerable to trafficking risks, including illegal immigrants, sex workers, illegal workers, helpers, imported labour and other suspected victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in 2023, it screened 11,000 people, representing an increase of 45 percent compared to the previous year. It found only three victims, which demonstrated that trafficking in persons wasn't prevalent or widespread in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said it would be baseless and unfair to cast doubt on the city's quality of screenings just because of the low number of the victims identified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also noted that in 2018, it established a high-level steering committee that provided policy on human trafficking and protection of foreign domestic helpers.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Court of Final Appeal hears the case of the seven defendants on Monday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758819_1_20240624184755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Final Appeal on Monday reserved judgement in a case of seven defendants and their involvement in an unauthorised procession in 2019, with the arguments from the prosecution and defence centring on the issue of proportionality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Six former lawmakers – Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-yan, Cyd Ho and Leung Kwok-hung – and Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai had been found guilty of organising and taking part in the demonstration on August 18, 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had approved an assembly at Victoria Park on that day, but banned a march out of the venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeal earlier acquitted them of organising the assembly, but upheld the participation convictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also lowered by several months the defendants’ jail sentences, which ranged from suspended terms to up to 18 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final appeal by the seven defendants, the defence lawyers argued at the city's top court that because police didn’t make any arrests on the day and the demonstration was peaceful, their subsequent arrests and convictions were “operationally disproportionate”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the court should conduct proportionality tests when passing a verdict, arguing a conviction would be a form of restriction that infringes on the fundamental constitutional rights of the freedoms of assembly and expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The courts, they argued, must protect such rights as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice (DOJ) countered that there was nothing in the law to support a proportionality test at the conviction stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Counsel Benjamin Yu, for the DOJ, also argued the defence had not raised the issue before, and had no ground to do so now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not simply they were engaged in an unauthorised procession, it was also that they knowingly violated the prohibition by police,” Yu told the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel of five Court of Final Appeal judges, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, reserved judgement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four of the defendants attended the hearing. Lai and Leung, who are in custody over separate national security cases, did not attend. Cyd Ho, who had finished serving her sentence over this case, was also absent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said the restructuring of the government's arts and culture promotion agency marks a milestone in the industry's development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yeung attended the launching ceremony of the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA), which is the successor to Create Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CCIDA aims to be a one-stop shop for the sector, in areas such as intellectual property and content distribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the ceremony, Yeung said the formation of the new agency is part of the government's efforts to turn Hong Kong into a global hub for arts and cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency is taking on a new mission to create a better environment in Hong Kong, with an industry-oriented approach as a guiding principle to further promote the development of culture, art, and creative industries," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries Victor Tsang said CCIDA will focus more on the industrialisation of the arts and cultural sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Create Hong Kong focused more on the nurturing of talent and also explored more markets. But... we actually have to discuss more with each of the industries whether we can do a series of support in terms of different projects in order to bring them up to another level, maybe even at the top of the world. And this is what our strategy will do," he said.

    'CLP should prioritise protecting electricity pylons'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP Power says it will continue to install protective devices at its transmission towers that are more likely to be affected by inclement weather. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758799_1_20240624152506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There were calls on Monday for CLP Power to weather-proof its transmission towers to ensure they withstand the impact of inclement weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The electricity supplier said it had begun installing such facilities and would continue to do so in the coming two to three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm, which supplies electricity to Kowloon and the New Territories and most of the outlying islands in Hong Kong, set out short-, medium-, and long-term measures to deal with power interruptions, after reports of a power outage in buildings from a voltage dip on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power supply might have been affected by unstable weather as the thunderstorm warning was in force at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Short-term measures include increasing manpower and resources to minimise the recurrence of power disruptions and restore electricity as quickly as possible, while measures would be taken over the medium term to boost protection of outdoor facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the long run, the electricity supplier would review its asset management and maintenance with the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Wing-yip, an electrical and building services engineer, said the firm should prioritise protective devices for its transmission towers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the rainy season has just started with typhoons expected, the priority should be on implementing waterproofing and anti-lightning facilities. There must be some kind of priority, because there's quite a number of transmission towers, with over 100 of them in the New Territories," Ho told an RTHK programme on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we need to put in place such measures, we have to be selective. Some of the transmission towers are on mountain tops, and they are more prone to be struck by lightning, so they should be dealt with first given the limited resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung, CLP's senior director, power systems, told the same programme there would be more anti-lightning devices in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had begun installing anti-lightning devices as early as 20 years ago, for the sake of risk management. We referenced data from the Observatory, and installed anti-lightning devices at areas that were more likely to be struck by lightning," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the change in climate, there is a rising thunder frequency, so we will set up these protection devices in high, middle, and even low risk areas. We hope to do that in areas that we considered to have such a risk in the coming two to three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Cheung did not say whether the firm would compensate affected residents, only noting the electricity supplier was focusing on preventing more future power outages.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Applications opened on Monday for the first batch of light public housing flats, with hundreds of hopefuls turning up at the Housing Authority's office in Lok Fu.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said it had received some 1,800 applications by 6pm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok will be ready early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The modular homes are a stop-gap measure designed to improve the living conditions of those waiting for public housing, with priority given to families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants, who must have been on the waiting list for public housing for at least three years, will still be eligible for traditional flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Accompanying her mother, Bibi said getting one of the new flats would help them save money on rent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the money we pay for rent in private, we can save HK$7,800. I hope my mom can get [a flat] as we don't know who can get them as there are many people applying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Law said he lives in a subdivided flat in Tseung Kwan O and has been queuing for a public unit for four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government rolled out the [light public housing] plan and I am eligible, so I came here to apply. It is undoubtedly better than living in subdivided flats, it has everything," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lee, 64, said he would like to move to one of the modular flats while he waits to get a traditional unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now I live in To Kwa Wan, one of the subdivided apartments in Hong Kong. The living condition is poor and there is [only] enough room for myself and my dog," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successful applicants will be notified by the last quarter of this year.

    Civil servants must safeguard national security: Yeung

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, has said it is most important for government workers to uphold the constitutional order and national security, according to the code of conduct for civil servants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authorities earlier revised the Civil Service Code, which lays out 12 fundamental values and standards of conduct, including political neutrality, confidentiality, and integrity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current government term, Yeung pointed out that civil servants are obligated to protect national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 12 values are all important. If I need to choose the most important value in the Civil Service Code, I'd agree it's the first one: upholding the constitutional order and national security," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The work of civil servants is not just a job or a means to achieve personal accomplishments or earn a salary. It is a mission. Civil servants have their constitutional roles to fulfill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the government is streamlining the civil service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From March 2021 until now, our civil service establishment have decreased by some 1,000 or nearly 2,000 [positions]. We have achieved this through various means, such as using more technology and streamlining procedures. We constantly review our processes which are no longer necessary. By eliminating those procedures, we can allocate manpower to other tasks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, on dental benefits for government workers, Yeung said the government is thinking about purchasing dental services in the Greater Bay Area, so that civil servants can access these benefits across the border.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China strategist Andrew Leung says Hong Kong has made advances in the field of social welfare over the past two years, although government departments still need to take more initiative when it comes to talking to one another.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comments on RTHK's
  <i>
   Hong Kong Today
  </i>
  programme as he was discussing next week's 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the two years in office of Chief Executive John Lee and his governing team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a number of achievements, for example on the social welfare front. You know, I have been Director of Social Welfare for four years before [former Chief Executive] Carrie Lam. So I'm quite familiar with this kind of improvement of various services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The establishment of the care teams, for example, actually translates kind of empty ideas into concrete actions. So I think that's very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Care teams were announced in the 2022 Policy Address. Coming under the Home Affairs Department, they support the government's district work, including visiting the needy and providing support during incidents and emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung also said many government departments still tended to operate within their own structures, undermining efficiency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regularly, people are not satisfied with the kind of people-oriented delivery of various government systems because various departments still tend to work in silos and they just sort of follow their own rule book," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said there needed to be better coordination among government departments.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Monday said all of the displays are working normally at Hong Kong International Airport, after a computer glitch on Sunday caused displays, the airport's website, and the MyHKG app to stop updating real-time flight information.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said all the flight information display screens - including those in the departure halls, arrival halls, boarding gates and baggage reclaim halls - were operating normally. It said there had been a thorough check-up in the early hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority also said its website and the MyHKG app were operating normally and were providing real-time flight information. It said flights continue to operate normally but it was advising passengers to refer to the latest flight information and to allow sufficient time to check in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the authority's executive director of engineering and technology, Ricky Leung, said there was no evidence it was a hacking attack.

    More firms to join scheme to fight cybercrimes

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758669_1_20240623143857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A scheme aimed at helping businesses fight cybercrimes is set to be expanded this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police will partner with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data to relaunch the "Bughunting" campaign that was first introduced in 2023 to help firms identify underlying cybersecurity problems. It also provides free tests to participating enterprises to identify cybersecurity loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixty companies joined the campaign last year and 197 security loopholes were identified, with 10 percent of them of severe level and around 40 percent of high risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, the number of participating firms is expected to top 200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe most corporates will not have much resources to take on cybersecurity work as they have other business to take care of, therefore we hope to use resources to help corporates to deal with their cybersecurity problems," said Baron Chan, superintendent of the police Cyber Security Division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the tasks for the authorities is to collect intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been collecting intelligence from other sources to understand the overall cyber-threat landscape. In the first quarter of this year, we analysed over 2.8 million pieces of cybersecurity threat, of which 18,758 were related to attacks against Hong Kong," said Raymond Lam, chief superintendent of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau, adding that 46 percent were related to phishing and 30 percent linked to malware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first four months of this year, the number of tech-related cases stood at 10,113 – a figure similar to last year's – involving HK$1.86 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said while most of the culprits were from overseas, officers will also keep an eye out for local hacker groups.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, Starry Lee, headed to Beijing on Sunday for the upcoming National People's Congress Standing Committee meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport prior to her departure, Lee said the NPC Standing Committee would be reviewing 12 pieces of legislation at the meeting, among them draft revision to the Emergency Response Law, draft Financial Stability Law and draft Preschool Education Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that five reports would be deliberated as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said it is important for Hongkongers to be aware of changes in national laws even though laws on the mainland do not apply directly to Hong Kong, given that many people from the SAR often travel and do business there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NPC Standing Committee meeting will be held from Tuesday to Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) said real-time updates on its terminal display screens were gradually resuming on Sunday afternoon, hours after a glitch in its flight information display system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AA said no flights were cancelled but a few were delayed due to the system failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Leung, the authority's executive director of engineering and technology, said there was no evidence it was a hacking attack, and that they will later examine the system in detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will actually do more thorough checking in the rest of the time... There is no hacking activity we've identified so far. In terms of maintenance, it's mainly maintained and operated by our own in-house personnel," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA has said all airport operations were normal as it was trying to fix the glitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung said he's very concerned about the incident, and told the authority to investigate the case and submit a report to the government.

    'Expand medical fee waiver to lessen patients' burden'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tim Pang of the Society for Community Organisation (third right, front row) says any public medical fee increases should not exceed 10 percent. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758678_1_20240623155609.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO said on Sunday that a medical fee waiver mechanism that provides assistance to needy patients should be widened to include people aged 65 or above, patients receiving disability allowance and those on working family subsidies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tim Pang, community organiser from the Society for Community Organisation, made the comment after the government said it would review fees and charges for public healthcare services within this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For elderly who are receiving the Old Age Living Allowance, the existing waiving level is up to 75 years old, so we will propose lowering the eligible age to 65. Another category for waiving should be patients receiving disability allowance. For those who are already recipients of disability allowance, it means they have more needs, more frequent need to consult medical service, so it cost them more on the medical fee," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For helping the low-income families, we think if they are receiving working families subsidies, it is already showing they have financial difficulties and for these families, the government should issue them a waiver. Any of the family members who have medical needs, they can waive their medical fees when consulting public doctors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Based on a questionnaire conducted on people's thoughts of higher medical fees, Pang said the survey revealed that some people experienced financial burden when medical bills began to pile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We find out that particularly some patients who do have higher medical expenditure to their household income, so we think the government should study this group of people, so-called poverty due to disease. We think it should be another targeted group that the government should study and also provide additional support to prevent poverty due to disease," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waiving of medical charges currently includes recipients of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, some holders of the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly, and Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang added that any fee increases should be no more than 10 percent, to minimise the financial burden on patients.

    Govt considering law amendment to handle ride-hailing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Transport chief Lam Sai-hung says the authorities will discuss with the sector next month on how to regulate online ride-hailing services. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758675_1_20240623153656.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Sunday said the government is looking into amending the law to handle unlicensed ride-hailing services in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a television programme, Lam said he expects the quality of cab service to improve with the introduction of a licensed taxi fleet system, under which an online booking channel is a requirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether online car-hailing platforms will be regulated, the secretary for transport and logistics said the authorities were still working on the matter, and they'll further discuss it with Legco and the sector next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see whether we can amend the law to make it easier and more effective to handle unlicensed ride-hailing services. At the same time, we will see how to manage online car-hailing platforms," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We shall look into how this is done overseas. There are a lot of online car-hailing platforms on the mainland or in other Asian countries. We are looking into their laws and requirements for licences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a survey found that about 75 percent of interviewees support legalising online car-hailing services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Youth Forum interviewed more than 800 people earlier this month, and it found that over half of the interviewees said they would use online ride-hailing services instead of taxis, if the price is similar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group said introducing online ride-hailing could lead to fair competition, thus improving the service quality of taxis.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said an enterprise from the United States has chosen Hong Kong to set up its first bio-computing innohub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan also said the first Bio-Computing Innovation Summit will be held in Hong Kong on Monday, and discussions will be held among global leaders in areas such as artificial intelligence and life sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Hong Kong Investment Corporation will sign a strategic collaboration agreement at the summit with the US biotechnology research company, BioMap, which is setting up business in Hong Kong this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the company will be able to support bio-computing-related research in areas like medical and health, green technology and industrial innovation.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says while no power interruption was caused by the voltage dip, power supply might have been affected by unstable weather.

<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP said it received reports of power outage in buildings after a voltage dip in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government expressed concern about the incident and told the power firm to submit a report within four weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said at about 3am, a brief voltage dip occurred at its overhead line power supply system connecting Yuen Long and Shenzhen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said while no power interruption was caused by the voltage dip, power supply might have been affected by unstable weather as the thunderstorm warning was in force at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Fung Chuen Court in Diamond Hill, the security office said a blackout there lasted for more than an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's not immediately known how many buildings were affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said the utility company should enhance the capability of its power supply system, particularly the lightning protection capability of 400 kV overhead line towers, as soon as possible to withstand the impact of inclement weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse also said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) will follow up with CLP on how to reduce the risk caused by the high frequency of thunderstorm warnings in these few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EMSD has told the firm to identify the cause of the incident and formulate improvement plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the latest in a series of glitches involving the power firm. Earlier this month, the government said it would ask an independent consultant to investigate CLP power outages over the past three years after more than 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for about four hours.

    Computer system failure affects flight data updates

 The Airport Authority (AA) said on Sunday that it could not provide real-time updates on flight information on the terminal's display screens at the airport, its website and the My HKG mobile app because of failure in the flight information display system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AA said no flights were delayed due to the incident. But it still advised passengers to allow for sufficient time to check in at the airport and to communicate with airlines on the latest flight status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, it doesn't affect the data. That's why all the airport operations, including the check-in, the landing and departure, were normal," Steven Yiu, the authority's executive director of airport operations, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What has been impacted was the fixed display to the public, including the website and also the mobile app. We found [problems with] some of the software controlling the display system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yiu said the AA was trying to fix the glitch as soon as possible, adding that there was no evidence showing that it was caused by human error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said its emergency centre has been activated, and contingency measures have been implemented to handle affected service and procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's only a problem with the display screens so it probably won't affect the flights. But because this is very important information for travellers, I hope they can fix it as soon as possible," a tourist told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another traveller complained about the inconvenience caused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It creates a lot of trouble. I don't know where I should go to check-in. I have luggage and kids with me. It's just troublesome. No matter at which airport, if such a problem occurs, and no one is assisting travellers, it must affect the reputation of the place," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said he's very concerned about the computer glitch, and that the AA should make every effort to keep passengers informed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on social media, he called on the authority to investigate the case and submit a report to the government.

 Police on Saturday arrested a man on suspicion of murdering his girlfriend at a Fanling flat on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers say the 59-year-old suspect called the police at 5.23 pm on Saturday to report that a woman was unresponsive at a flat in Wah Min House on Wah Sum Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paramedics arrived ten minutes later and declared the woman dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Po assistant commander Brian Chung said the woman had sustained multiple bruises and arrested the man on the spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death, he added, and investigations are continuing.
