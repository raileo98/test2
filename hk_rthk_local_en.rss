<div class="itemFullText">
 Electronic queuing systems for taxis have been brought in at the arrival hall to reduce queues during extreme weather, the Airport Authority said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven Yiu, the executive director of airport operations, said the system was introduced in March this year after people had to queue for hours last year during a typhoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a mobile phone notification or the airport's information board would now tell passengers when their taxi was ready.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to avoid a long queuing for prolonged-waiting passengers. For example, if the typhoon lasts three to four hours, we don't let the passengers keep queuing for long periods of time, so we give them some sort of queuing number so they can stay in the restaurant and also rest until being called forward to the taxi station," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We created a resting area, actually it is a large area with over 500 chairs, with a Wifi, charging facility. We will also distribute water, biscuits to them, and also some blankets as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authority hopes to make passengers feel comfortable, especially when taxis and Airport Express trains can't operate under Typhoon Signal No 9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three judges presiding over a subversion trial centred on an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations said in their ruling on Thursday that two of the defendants were acquitted because they were not sure if the pair had the intention to subvert state power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the judgement, former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun never advocated vetoing government budgets in the election forum they had attended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution argued during the trial that the suspects planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure to be introduced by the government, had they become Legco members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, the judges said although Lau's name appeared on a declaration of poll candidates, they were not sure if he had signed it himself or authorised someone to sign it on his behalf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the "Inked without Regret" declaration agreed to use the vetoing power of lawmakers to force the chief executive to accede to the five demands of protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a fact that [Lau] did not post the [declaration] on his Facebook page and he did not make use of the [declaration] in his electioneering work," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said although the now-disbanded Civic Party, which Lee belonged to, endorsed the declaration, he was not yet a candidate at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also noted that Lee had asked his election team to come up with a new pamphlet that did not mention the five demands after looking at the national security law, which took effect in June 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released after the verdict at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still other defendants in this case, warranting our concern and even love," Lau told reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's any star in this case, this judgement should be the star. It sets the jurisprudence, reasoning, logic, perspectives of our judges. Please study it. This is more important than any single individual of this case. This is part of our rule of law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the first thing he'd like to do was to have a meal with his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel calm, as I have always been... Thank you to everyone who have been concerned about us and expressing your care. We all can feel that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there is a tendency for the prosecution to apply for an appeal, so I cannot make any comment on this case at this moment."

    Use of force not necessary for subversion, court finds
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The court ruled that those who intentionally commit an act that contravenes the national security law with the intent to subvert state power don't have to use force or know they're breaching the law to be found guilty." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755349_1_20240530121750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A landmark ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date has set out that those who plot to subvert state power need not use force or employ criminal means to be found guilty of breaching the national security law (NSL), nor do they need to know that their tactics were unlawful.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan laid out their reasoning in a 319-page judgement, which found 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion while acquitting two others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges concluded that those convicted had taken part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government by unlawful means with a view to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court found that they had planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure request by the government if they win a majority in the Legislative Council election in 2020, to compel the chief executive to accede to demands made by anti-government protesters or be forced to dissolve the legislature and resign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges rejected arguments by defence lawyers that "unlawful means" necessitates the use or threat of force; that guilty parties must know that what they were doing was illegal; and that Legco members who veto government budgets are merely exercising their constitutional duty instead of breaking the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ruling, the judges noted that the NSL was drafted with the understanding that national security in the city could be undermined not only by force, but also by non-violent actions such as advocating Hong Kong's independence, inciting public hatred, and paralysing the work of the government and legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said limiting "unlawful means" to acts of force would be such a narrow interpretation that "would be absurd and illogical and defeat the purpose of the NSL".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also swept aside defence arguments that "other unlawful means" should only include criminal acts, saying it’s “inconceivable that acts or activities by whatever forms and methods with a view to subverting the state power could be considered to be acceptable or tolerable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moreover, they ruled that the defendants did not have to be aware that they were breaching the law at the time of the offence, so long as the accused had intentionally committed an unlawful act with a view to subverting state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Therefore, it was irrelevant to the issue of guilt that the accused acted with a mistaken belief that his or her means was lawful; to hold otherwise would go against the purpose of the NSL,” the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the judges agreed that legislators should not automatically approve government budgets, any plan to indiscriminately veto such budgets in an attempt to force the government to accept political demands would, they concluded, constitute an abuse of power that contravenes both the Basic Law and the NSL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also dismissed defence claims that the offence wasn’t clearly defined because the law doesn’t provide specific definitions for "subversion" or "state power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said it was obvious that all the powers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ultimately came from the Constitution and the Central People's Government, and concluded that "state power" refers to those wielded by the SAR government, including the various duties and functions it performs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a dictionary definition of "subversion", the judges ruled that “a serious interference in, disruption or undermining of the performance of duties and functions in accordance with the law by the body of power of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region… could amount to an act ‘subverting the State power’.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As such, they found that 14 defendants had knowingly participated in the plot, with the intention of subverting state power, and therefore found them guilty.

    FS hopes for stronger ties between China, US bay areas

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has told the business community in Berkeley, California that he hopes there will be further financial and technological exchanges between the state's bay area and the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and the University of Hong Kong both signed a memorandum of understanding with a California-based climate institute to cooperate in areas such as talent exchanges, green fintech and carbon market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope, too, that we can encourage financial and technological exchanges. The global gap for green funding and technology is enormous, measured in trillions of US dollars. Let's turn this need into opportunities,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to say that Hong Kong is a great place to do business in Asia, being the "super connector" between China and the rest of the world, and invited US businesses to pay a visit to the SAR to see what is on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also told attendees at a climate event that Hong Kong is committed to a greener future and that the SAR plans to reach carbon neutrality in the coming decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are adopting a four-pronged strategy to reach neutrality: net-zero electricity generation, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Indeed, we were among the first cities in Asia to take action against climate change… Our carbon emissions peaked in 2014 and have shown a general downward trend since.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 if a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea develops into a tropical depression.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the low-pressure area is still loosely organised but may intensify. It is expected to move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that there will be showers, thunderstorms and strong winds in the coming days, while offshore winds will also strengthen.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The group in charge of promoting patriotic education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee on Thursday said it is going to hold design contests in which participants create mascots and logos that reflect the theme of "love our country, love Hong Kong, and love our community."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The competitions would be held in separate primary, secondary, and tertiary divisions. The winning design could be used in events celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners and the first and second runner-ups would also receive annual passes to the Hong Kong Palace Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registration for the competition starts today and will close on July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's convenor, Starry Lee, said all schools in the SAR would be invited to join the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have designed a theme that is ‘to love our motherland, to love Hong Kong and to love the community’. We need a logo or symbol to represent this main theme. We will issue a letter to all schools in the community, including universities, secondary and primary schools, to invite all schools to join and participate in this competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hopefully, we can find some very symbolic design so that we can use in other part of our activities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while participation is voluntary, she expects a lot of students would join the contests.

 Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by participating in a unsanctioned 'primary election' organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two others – former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun – were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those convicted in the subversion case were Gordon Ng, Tat Cheng, Clarisse Yeung, Michael Pang, Kalvin Ho, Helena Wong, Sze Tak-loy, Gwyneth Ho, Raymond Chan, Owen Chow, Lam Cheuk-ting, Leung Kwok-hung, Ricky Or and Winnie Yu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were remanded in custody, pending sentencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict was handed down by three national security judges in a hearing at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.

    Robots help with spine surgery at Queen Mary Hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Over the past eight months, robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at the hospital. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755312_1_20240530094044.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at Queen Mary Hospital since October. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong say the robot can help surgeons be more precise and accurate when placing screws, and thus reduce the risk of complications and the need for more surgery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jason Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong's medical school, led the research team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say there are a couple of aspects that it improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First it of course increases patient safety. So in the past when we are doing the surgeries, where we insert the screws, they are all done by free hand, meaning that it is up to the surgeons' experience to identify where the correct position is for the screws...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secondly, it helps the surgeon with the overall process of the surgery. Surgeons no longer need to be completely concentrated to put screws in accurately. They can actually put their major part of the concentration into more risky procedures, such as decompression of the nerves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Cheung said surgeons would still remain in overall control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So even to this day when I am using the robot, despite it guiding me, I will still always check whether the track of the screws are correct or not. So I will always double-check myself by feel, perhaps an X-ray just to confirm whether everything is accurate," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Cheung said the robot didn't just help with inserting the screws. He said, prior to surgery, surgeons would take a CT scan from the patient and plan where to put the screws. The system would then match this with the plan and guide the surgeon.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court is set to begin delivering a verdict on whether 16 opposition figures breached the national security law by participating in an unofficial legislative primary election four years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Queues formed outside the West Kowloon Court where the hearing is held amid tightened security and a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixteen defendants who have pleaded not guilty are expecting to hear their fate after a subversion trial lasting 118 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, they could face up to life in prison although sentencing is expected later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among the 47 politicians and activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities alleged that an unofficial Legco primary election in July 2020 was a subversive attempt by the opposition camp to win a majority in Legco and paralyse the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 16 who stood trial include former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, and journalist-turned-activist Gwyneth Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was centred on whether they conspired to subvert state power by planning to indiscriminately vote down the budget and force the then-Chief Executive to resign through their participation in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others, including former legal scholar Benny Tai and ex-student activist Joshua Wong, pleaded guilty to their charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judiciary has set aside more than 400 seats for the public to hear the verdict on Thursday - the largest national security case to date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three national security judges - Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan - presided over the jury-free trial.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National security police on Wednesday said they arrested one more person on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Six people, including the former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were arrested on Tuesday and linked to seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that a 53-year-old woman arrested on Wednesday is the wife of one of those taken into custody the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers are not ruling out further arrests.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Wednesday said it arrested 12 people, including footballers and coaches, for alleged match-fixing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said the head coach, a midfielder and a goalkeeper of a football team in the Hong Kong Premier League were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also taken into custody were a coach and five players from two teams in the third-tier Second Division. Three betting agents were arrested as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC did not name the suspects or their clubs, citing an ongoing investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged offences took place over three seasons, beginning with the 2021 campaign, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matthew Chang, a principal investigator with the ICAC, said the coaches allegedly communicated with players with signals during the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They would give some secret signals during the match if they can recruit some players in the same team, like moving their head or using their body language, gestures, to show that at which specific times the involved players have to do something, like to keep going to score or just stop to defend,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said each player could get up to tens of thousands of dollars for each match fixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also believed that some of those arrested placed bets in illegal gambling for gains, with the amount of bets topping HK$1 million in one season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said the suspects have been released on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Football Association of Hong Kong, China said it will fully assist the ICAC in the investigation, stressing that it has "zero tolerance" towards football corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the association said if the allegations are proven true, it will severely punish the clubs, players and coaches involved by revoking their memberships and imposing lifetime suspensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Premier League expressed regret over the incident, adding that it will work with the football association to create a fair and clean football industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said it will not tolerate illegal acts. The bureau said it will urge the local football association to work with ICAC and improve the anti-corruption awareness of football clubs.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755192_1_20240529142204.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said efforts are underway to respond to a court order on formulating an official framework to recognise same-sex partnerships following a landmark ruling last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Court of Final Appeal ruled last September that the government has a constitutional duty to allow gay couples to register their partnerships, in a case brought by former activist Jimmy Sham who married his male partner in New York in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top court said the government would be given two years to come up with an alternative framework so that same-sex relationships could be provided legal recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to a request by lawmaker Regina Ip for an update on the situation, constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang said officials are "actively taking forward the relevant work" and will seek the views of the Legislative Council in due course, once there are concrete suggestions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the matter is complex and involves a wide range of issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now following the court's relevant judgment and timetable, conducting detailed study with the [Department of Justice] and relevant bureaux on the mechanism relating to the legal recognition of same-sex relationship, thresholds of recognition, eligibilities, conditions, how to effectively avoid abuses of the alternative framework, etc, as well as the rights and obligations arisen, including 'core rights' and 'supplementary rights', and formulating implementation," he said.

<img alt="Paul Chan met with representatives from five SAR startups currently exploring opportunities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755181_3_20240529124657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday told business leaders in San Francisco that the SAR is a “natural launching pad” for them to enter the Asian and China markets, as he promoted collaboration between the China-US bay areas on a five-day trip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a business luncheon, Chan said there were many commonalities between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area, with the two places the global engines of technological innovation and also the birthplaces of tech firm giants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area are a magnet, attracting a lot of talent, that is our competitive advantage, and also this will give us continuous impetus in terms of innovation and technological development,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to point out there’s also a difference between the two places in terms of population and market sizes, as the Californian bay area has a population of about seven million, while the Guangdong bay area population stands at some 87 million, with huge market potential contributing to some 12 percent of the Chinese economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So if you want to launch your products or services in Asia, in China, Hong Kong is naturally your launching pad, because from here you can springboard to other parts of the mainland and Asia,” he told delegates, noting the SAR’s financial markets are much bigger in breadth and depth compared with Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between InvestHK and San Francisco’s Bay Area Council to promote cooperation especially in the green economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the finance minister also met with representatives of five Hong Kong startups currently exploring expansion in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five SAR startups specialise in areas including biodegradable materials, new construction materials, online marketing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and the entrepreneurs are exploring the market there whilst undertaking training programmes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also welcomed a plan by a Silicon Valley startup accelerator company to set up a technological innovation centre in the SAR.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s lived-in home prices rose for the second straight month in April, increasing by 0.3 percent from March, with all home sizes seeing gains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Wednesday showed that the latest official price index of second-hand units stood at 308.7 last month, compared with 305.7 in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase was broad-based, as all small, medium, and large sized units saw gains of about 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came after the index logged its first increase in 11 months in March, as buyers returned to the market after Financial Secretary Paul Chan scrapped all property cooling measures in his Budget on February 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, taking the first four months in total, home prices still fell 0.84 percent, and the latest index level was still about 13 percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rental prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent on a monthly basis, also a second straight increase, but still 4.6 percent lower from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s rents rose 0.5 percent in the first four months of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Baptist University academic says he hopes a framework can be established on promoting "food as medicine" in the primary healthcare system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The university is hosting a two-day conference called FoodMed. Terence Lau, the university's Interim Chief Innovation Officer and chair of the conference, said Chinese medicine used many herbal components that people also consumed as food, such as ginseng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, he was asked about the relationship to medicine, especially as there had previously been controversies in Hong Kong over naturopathic - or so-called holistic - treatments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can enhance primary health by alleviating a lot of unhealthy conditions and food can also provide a lot of benefits for chronic diseases," he said. "We are not trying to replace the traditional, or western, medicine doctors. But I think it's another approach to enhance people's health."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lau also called for the greater use of technology in the field, especially when it came to data collection. He said Chinese medicine had a lot of heritage and the conference would be looking at better ways to utilise this.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority on Tuesday said a four-year-old girl suffered a cardiac arrest after receiving stitches in Yan Chai Hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said the medical staff resuscitated her and that she regained a heartbeat 18 minutes later, but remains in a coma and in critical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was sent to Yan Chai Hospital’s accident and emergency department after sustaining a head injury in a fall on Saturday night. The child had a slight fever and medical staff put stitches into a two-centimetre gash in her head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital's chief executive, Ian Cheung, said this incident was "very rare", adding the staff had followed procedures when giving her three stitches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very short process... She cried during the first stitch, but she quieted down during the second and the third stitches," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We checked her after completing the process because it's over so quickly, and we found out she didn't have a pulse. So we must find experts to give us advice on why this happened."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The girl was then transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong Nai-chung, chief of service for paediatrics in both Princess Margaret and Yan Chai hospitals, said she suffered from ischemic encephalopathy, which meant her brain was injured because blood supply decreased when her heart stopped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, she is on a ventilator, given heart medication and drugs to control seizures and swelling in the brain. These are also coupled with antibiotics and nutrient injections. Our team will monitor her situation closely and provide the most appropriate treatment for her," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority said it is upset by the incident, and is providing assistance to the girl's family.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people were arrested on Tuesday under Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation, with police saying the group is suspected of "offences in connection with seditious intention".
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security police accused a woman who was on remand of taking advantage of "a forthcoming sensitive date" and publishing seditious posts on social media anonymously, with the help of five others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, was one of those arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 37 and 65, were arrested by national security police at various locations in the city, including the Tai Lam Centre for Women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social media posts since April were allegedly aimed at inciting public hatred of the central government, the SAR administration and the judiciary, and were allegedly designed to encourage people to organise or take part in illegal activities, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electronic devices suspected of having been used to publish posts with seditious intention were among items seized during the operation, the force added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These are the first arrests made under Hong Kong's homegrown national security legislation that came into effect in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesperson noted that people found guilty of committing offences in connection with seditious intention face a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also warned that people who try to endanger national security should not think they can avoid police investigation by making anonymous comments online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The allegations (against) this group of people are using a Facebook page on social media to advocate hatred against our central government, the Hong Kong government and also our judiciary,” Tang told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They're relating to a forthcoming sensitive date. But I would like to reiterate that... the main crime is not about the subject. It's about their utilising the subject during which they incited hatred against the central government and our Hong Kong government and the judiciary. This incitement of hatred is the cause of the crime.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 The four fencers representing the SAR in the Olympics on Tuesday said they hope to use the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait next month as final preparation for Paris in July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Star fencer Vivian Kong has won several large events, including the Fujairah Women's Epee World Cup 2024 and the Barcelona Women's Epee World Cup 2024, but has yet to win an Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she still has to give it her all, even though this will be her third Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's like psychologically and mentally [where] I need to be calm and that's like usually the hardest part when we compete especially in foreign competitions. Technically, it's all my coach [Octavian Zidaru]. He knows every action we work on," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's always like this one higher, this one lower, this one point more accurately, so there's always something wrong with my actions, so I have to work hard to make him happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Olympic gold-medallist Edgar Cheung said he doesn't want to let the pressure to win another medal affect his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the competition in Kuwait will give him another practice opportunity before the Games, adding that it's vital to perform to the best of his ability and enjoy the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, there are challenges but for me, it is like preparing well for myself, and give all my best, and afterwards, we will see what happens. I think me and Vivian had quite a good experience about the Olympics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the two of the rest, one is my ex-roommate so we are friends. We have been talking about the Olympics, how it is and I just told them to enjoy and to have fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Epee fencer Cedric Ho said he is excited to have booked his place in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though I'm really excited, I do want to bring that energy down a little and enter the Olympics with a calm mindset," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will be going to the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait at the end of June, and those results will determine our rankings in the Olympics. I will use that competition as a prep for the Games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for Daphne Chan, she said she doesn't have specific expectations from the Games, and is just looking forward to learning from her teammates and staying focused for Paris.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers will soon be able to watch a series of special RTHK Olympics-related programmes in Putonghua, Cantonese and English, including some produced on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sign language and audio description services will also be available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes after RTHK signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Guangdong Radio and Television on Monday, and another with Beijing Radio and Television Station (BRTV) on Tuesday, to jointly deliver news related to the Paris Olympics and Paralympics 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China Media Group is also a cooperation partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the special shows will be produced locally, featuring issues related to Environmental, social, and governance, to echo the Paris Games’ goal of being the greenest Games ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be a raft of programmes produced by the Guangdong and Beijing TV stations, with content ranging from local culture, behind-the-scenes stories of the Winter Olympics 2022, as well as individual athletes’ preparations for this summer's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a signing ceremony, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the programmes will promote a sports culture in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This allows all Hongkongers to cheer for athletes from the national team and Team Hong Kong, while uniting all sectors of the society and encouraging residents to do more exercise,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Meanwhile, we hope that the broadcast of the Paris Olympics and the Paralympics Games 2024 will further spur local catering and retail activities, boosting the local economy by creating a ‘multiplier effect’,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li Xiulei, deputy chief editor of BRTV, said the cooperation between Hong Kong and Beijing marks the beginning of a deepening of cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope Hong Kong viewers and listeners could learn about Beijing’s profound culture via the programmes by BRTV,” she said, adding that she hopes the two cities will further strengthen collaboration to provide more diversified programmes for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong government has purchased broadcasting rights for this year's Olympics, allowing RTHK, TVB, Hoy TV and ViuTV to show the Games on their free-to-air channels.

    Increase penalties over illicit cigarettes: customs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Tuesday proposed increasing the penalties for crimes involving illicit cigarettes, after they detected a 50 percent rise in cases this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Customs recorded over 7,000 cases in the first five months, which was a 54 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An assistant customs commissioner, Lai Chi-wing, said most illicit cigarettes were shipped into Hong Kong before the pandemic, but more travellers had been bringing in illicit cigarettes into the city after the border reopened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The total number of incoming passengers bringing in dutiable cigarettes was over 5,000 [from February to May], so this is not a small figure. So we try to target these incoming passengers bringing in small amount of cigarettes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials recommended increasing the maximum imprisonment term from two to seven years, and to double the maximum fine to HK$2 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also proposed including the offence of illicit cigarettes under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance, as cases may involve syndicates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs proposed that cigarettes being sold lower than the tax amount should be presumed as duty-not-paid goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It pointed out there were packs of cheap white cigarettes being sold at HK$40 in the market, which was even lower than the required tax of HK$66 for a packet of 20 cigarettes.

    'Turn south Lantau into a resort town'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it's exploring ways to turn south Lantau into an eco-tourism hub. Photo courtesy of the Development Bureau" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755060_1_20240528174959.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday called on authorities to speed up its long-standing plan to turn south Lantau into a tourist spot, with some urging the government to make it a high-end vacation resort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials told a Legco meeting they were collecting the public's views over the next two months on building a pier and accommodation facilities in Cheung Sha, as well as setting up a water sports centre at Hong Kong’s longest beach there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the proposed South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor plan, an uphill chairlift would also be built in Cheung Sha, and the neighbouring areas of Shek Pik, Shui Hau and Pui O would get walkways around a reservoir, along the shore of a sand flat, or on treetops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But legislators like Andrew Lam said the government had earlier made such plans in its blueprint to develop Lantau back in 2017, and had asked authorities to act on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undersecretary for Development David Lam said the government would try to build more parking spaces, family playgrounds and a visitor’s centre in the area in a year or two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The undersecretary said preliminary assessments on the environment and infrastructure had shown the proposals would not have any adverse impact on south Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is estimated the corridor would attract 4,000 to 6,000 more visitors a day during holidays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will have to access the reception capacity of Lantau as a whole because it wouldn't be ideal if too many visitors are going to the area and destroy the local characteristics. So maybe we'll implement an online booking system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said authorities could transform south Lantau into an upscale vacation destination featuring high-end resort hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said authorities were liaising with developers and had received some positive response.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong triathlete Jason Ng has beaten Ayan Beisenbayev from Kazakhstan for the remaining spot in Paris Olympic qualification reserved for the highest-ranked Asian nation or region that hadn't already made it through to the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng had been going neck to neck against Beisenbayev for the remaining place, after Japan's top three athletes secured spots based on individual Olympic rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the weekend's Asia Triathlon Cup, Ng was disqualified for wearing a helmet during the running portion of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, given that Beisenbayev failed to finish on the podium to accumulate the points he needed, Hong Kong were able to win a spot in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng secured the 33rd ticket for the SAR delegation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he expects half of Hong Kong's companies would be using artificial intelligence by the end of this year, adding that technology and innovation is the government's priority.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the UBS Asian Investment Conference, Lee said the SAR understands the important role technology plays in the future of investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong continues to evolve. As we embrace new technologies and sustainable practices, we strengthen our position as the foreign investment gateway to mainland China, and as the conduit for mainland enterprises to invest in the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology and innovation is a central priority of the Hong Kong SAR government. That includes applying AI technology to fast track our smart city and digital government ambitions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added the government was launching more than 100 digital government and smart-city initiatives and expediting the establishment of an AI Supercomputing Centre in Cyberport.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has arrived in San Francisco to promote opportunities brought by the Greater Bay Area to major business communities, as well as industrial and tech enterprises.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As well as a luncheon and a "Bay-to-Bay Dialogue", Chan will also attend the "US-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action", to seek environmental collaboration between the two countries.

    Govt not given up on waste charging: environment chief

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Govt not given up on waste charging: environment chief" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755004_1_20240528111109.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Green groups disagreed with the government's decision to postpone waste charging indefinitely, but the environment minister stressed officials had not given up on the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration announced on Monday it would not implement the pay-as-you-throw scheme on August 1 as originally planned, citing concerns among residents and the limited coverage of recycling facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said it was not suitable to set a date for the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our society has to be mature enough to accept this approach. Also, when the policy is introduced, its design has to be easy and accepted by the public, and be straight forward for frontline workers," Tse told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the coming year, we will of course expand our efforts on waste reduction and recycling, as well as promotion. On the other hand, we will also look at how we can enhance the scheme, gauge public sentiment, and see whether we have the conditions to introduce waste charging. We are not giving up on this concept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the government might roll out waste charging in phases if officials decided to re-introduce the scheme in future, so that it's more easily accepted by the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Edwin Lau, the founder and executive director of The Green Earth, told the same programme that the decision in postponing the scheme reflected a lack of faith and determination in the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the government's poll showed a majority of residents opposed waste charging, he understood the business sector was ready for the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many large companies and organisations said they had been prepared and had no issue [with the policy]. I have also asked some from the middle class, they said [paying] HK$50 a month was a very small amount," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government appeared to have amplified negative responses to the policy, but did not focus on positive feedbacks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Wendell Chan from Friends of the Earth called on the government to dig deeper to understand public opinion on the policy.

  <br/>
  "What we need to know is why opinion shifted, what happened there, what caused people to not like this scheme," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think we went in-depth enough, in terms of analysing these problems in order to tackle them. The problem is that the government, right now, is way too willing to back down instead of trying to resolve these issues."

<div class="itemFullText">
 There has been a mixed reaction to the news that the government has indefinitely postponed the roll-out of its waste charging scheme. Some lawmakers say they back the decision, noting that a trial had found many concerns about the pay-as-you-throw initiative. Others insisted that Hong Kong still has to find ways to better manage its waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, says a delay is reasonable. But he says officials should now get back to the original point of the scheme and better promote recycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Waste charging is only one of the many ways to reduce waste and waste treatment is a worldwide problem," he said. "One important thing is that we have to put more recycling facilities, more recycling points and shops so that we can push up recycling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said she supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”. But Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday were largely sympathetic towards the decision to suspend the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after a meeting at the Legislative Council, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the ultimate goal of the scheme was to promote recycling and reduce waste, but he acknowledged the public had misconceptions about the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The public misunderstood that this whole thing is actually tantamount to a poll tax, which means that everyone has to start paying more taxes because everyone needs to generate garbage," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most people are not aware of the fact that, no - that is not the end game. The end game is to reduce wastage generation. To do that, you need to do the wastage collection, the separation, so that some can be recycled. The whole world is doing that, and I cannot believe Hong Kong should just surrender and forget it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We insist the policy should be carried out because it is environmental protection. We feel disappointed that [over] the last two years the government [had inadequate] preparation to implement the policy," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quat urged the government to continue educating the public and to provide support for the city's recycling industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think now is a very good timing for the government to promote recycling and the reduction of waste. Because going through all this education process, a lot of citizens think that they support environmental protection and they want to participate in waste reduction," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quat also suggested the government introduce additional incentives, such as a rewards scheme, to encourage people to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of the Japanese anime character Doraemon can now catch the time-travelling robot cat on some trains, as well as at the Siu Hong Light Rail stop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leading up to the Doraemon exhibition on July 13 at the Avenue of Stars, the MTR Corporation has put up posters and decorations from the series at the stop, and has transformed some Light Rail, East Rail Line and Airport Express trains with the Doraemon theme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trains are covered in Doraemon blue, while the doors are pink to depict the "Anywhere Door" portal to any destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam, speaking for the organisers of the Doraemon event, said he hopes people can enjoy the iconic character during their journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Doraemon is everyone's friend. We want to bring more joy and more creativity to people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "MTR is one of the important daily [modes of] transportation in Hong Kong, so when people can see it everyday, we are happy to share the joy with everybody. Of course, people can also catch the train to our exhibition."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested 20 people after a gang allegedly gave foreign domestic helpers cash to open bank accounts used to process HK$10 million in criminal proceeds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Among the suspects picked up on suspicion of conspiracy to launder money were 14 Indonesian migrant workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A helper is suspected of having acted as an intermediary for a syndicate to recruit others, with meetings arranged at locations such as parks, fast food restaurants and hotel rooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers on Monday said they believe the helpers were paid between HK$1,000 and HK$2,500 for opening accounts, which were then managed by the syndicate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For foreign domestic workers, the amount [allegedly] paid is relatively high compared to their salaries. That also was the main incentive for them to [allegedly] sell their bank accounts," said Chief Inspector So Chi-bing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank accounts are suspected of being linked to 39 cases of fraud involving losses of HK$5.4 million, police added.

 RTHK announced on Monday that the broadcaster will join hands with Guangdong Radio and Television station (GRT) to produce various sports programmes including a documentary on legendary football players in both places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two stations also agreed to play each other's programmes about the upcoming Paris Olympics in order to broaden the audience's horizons and promote interactive exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deputy director for broadcasting, Christine Wai, signed a memorandum of understanding with the head of GRT's sports channel in Shenzhen on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "RTHK has been actively promoting cooperation and exchanges with various media organisations on the mainland. In addition to sports, we have also collaborated on television programmes that promote Chinese history and culture, and foster a sense of patriotism. These efforts aim to help Hong Kong people integrate into the overall development of the country and cultivate a sense of national identity," Wai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of GRT, Zhong Shixun, said the new agreement would bring high-quality development cooperation and initiate new collaborative projects that will bring mutual benefits and win-win outcomes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport workers’ union on Monday called on the government to ban unlicensed ride-hailing services and address the plight of the taxi trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Motor Transport Workers General Union said cab drivers have suffered a more than 30 percent drop in business in recent years due to competition with illegal taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos circulating online appear to show cabbies posing as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has urged people to leave such matters to law enforcement agencies, but the union’s principal vice-chairperson, Chong Wing-tak, said taxi drivers are not convinced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why do drivers perform sting operations? It's because of a lack of enforcement action by the government, transport authorities, and the police. We have endured this for more than ten years. We can't bear it anymore, so some drivers have organised these sting operations," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Ho, the union's director of the taxi driver branch, described illegal cab drivers as "irresponsible", noting that any injuries that occur during unlicensed ride-hailing services are not covered by insurance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, the Transport and Logistics Bureau is expected to report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also highlighted the limited coverage of recycling facilities, pointing out that the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also said the scheme had increased the workload and pressure on cleaners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong's economic recovery had not lived up to expectations and the implementation of the scheme could have a negative impact on businesses, particularly in the catering sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also addressed the misconception that the government's aim with the waste charging scheme was to generate more revenue. He clarified that the primary objective of the scheme was to improve waste management practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of these factors, the government had taken the decision to shelve the waste charging scheme, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed the government remained committed to improving waste management and recycling practices in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government would step up publicity work to raise awareness of waste management and improve the city’s recycling network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to report back to Legco on its work by the middle of next year, he said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun says the administration has to help low-income workers who don't have a lot of bargaining power. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754864_1_20240527142045.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Monday brushed aside concerns that a new mechanism for setting the statutory minimum wage was unfair to employers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the Executive Council approved recommendations to review the minimum wage annually instead of every two years. There would also be a new formula for calculating the hourly pay rate, which bars any reduction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmakers representing the business sector said the new mechanism only focuses on employees and gives workers the false hope of an annual pay rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, in response, said there is a need to help 17,000 low-income workers, who only account for 0.6 percent of the workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have very little bargaining power under the market mechanism. There are a lot of constraints on these workers, be it their abilities and other reasons, it is difficult for them to earn a decent pay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to reassure them that their wages would only go up rather than down. If they have to worry about the prospects of a wage cut, then it would add to their plight."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Opinion remained split on the best way forward for a citywide waste charging scheme, with some lawmakers urging authorities to shelve the plan and green groups calling for a timeline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sources said the government would shelve the pay-as-you-throw scheme scheduled to take effect from August 1, with lawmakers expected to discuss its fate during a Legco panel meeting on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told an RTHK programme that it was "irresponsible" to put the plan on the back-burner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe this won't help solve the waste problem in Hong Kong. Government departments should take the lead in implementing the waste charging scheme," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why not do it in phases first, instead of ignoring the issue and pretending that nothing's happened? This will waste a bill that's been on hold for 20 years, and Hong Kong will lose its chance to reduce waste."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a legislator and industry representatives told an RTHK programme that they welcome the move because the city was simply not ready for the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's more appropriate to shelve [the scheme] indefinitely. We should look at it practically. We've come up with a date before, but it didn't happen because the conditions were not met," said DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau added putting the plan on hold doesn't mean a stop in waste recycling and education work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that the catering industry was concerned about manpower shortages and rising operating costs if the scheme went as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five concern groups - including Civic Exchange, Green Power, Greenpeace, The Green Earth, and Greeners Action - wrote to the chief executive and asked for no more delay in the implementation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are investigating the death on Sunday of a cyclist in a village near Tai Po who apparently lost control of her bicycle while riding downhill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old woman was riding down Tai Mei Tuk Road towards Tai Mei Tuk town centre at around 7pm when she rammed into a drop barrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was taken unconscious to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in Tai Po, where she was declared dead about an hour after the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Territories North special traffic investigations team is looking into the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Mei Tuk is a popular destination for cyclists and hikers, located on the edge of the Plover Clove reservoir and country park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, officers in Kowloon West are continuing to look into the deaths of a motorcycle rider and his passenger in Mong Kok in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old motorcyclist and a 24-year-old woman were on a motorbike that collided with a taxi at the junction of Argyle Street and Nathan Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The taxi driver, 27, suffered limb injuries along with his 38-year-old passenger. A 69-year-old man who was walking past the scene suffered facial injuries from flying fragments in the crash. All three men required hospital treatment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An alliance of six NGOs supporting street sleepers on Sunday called on Hongkongers to show more compassion for the homeless.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Homeless Alliance said there is less negativity shown towards street sleepers nowadays, but there is still room for the public to better understand their plight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alliance held a fair on Sunday and invited people to sit in a demonstration set-up of cardboards and umbrellas to experience homelessness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also sharing sessions where current and former street sleepers shared their life stories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former homeless person, Siu-hing, said she was happy to tell people about herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope people will not look at homeless people with prejudice," she told RTHK. "I've had it rough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chi-keung, who said he was a big spender before becoming homeless, said he hopes people can learn from his experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People who become homeless all have their stories, I'm sharing mine so people will be alert," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isaac Ho, who works for ImpactHK – one of the six NGOs in the alliance – said fair participants can also learn how to communicate with the underprivileged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Don't miss the self-introduction when you approach them, let them know you're here as a human being to care for another human being," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the government to devise policies to support those who’re homeless, including having a longer notice period before cleaning the streets, and arranging housing for them in the long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to tackle [homelessness], we give them a home to live first. And then medical, social counseling, employment services can also be delivered to them. Sleeping in a more stable and safe environment is the foundation of change."

    'Fire safety inspections beefed up after Jordan blaze'

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754751_2_20240526160543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said officials have stepped up inspections of old buildings following a deadly blaze at a residential building in Jordan last month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On April 10, a No.3 alarm fire which broke out in New Lucky House killed five people and injured around 40 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Yeung said preliminary investigation showed that some of the fire doors were open, which might have led to heavy smoke in one of the staircases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the Fire Services Department has since improved its inspection mechanism, with priority being given to old buildings and those for commercial use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We use a risk-based inspection mechanism which decides how often a building should be checked each year based on how risky it is,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the fire in New Lucky House, we adjusted the mechanism to prioritise inspections of old buildings and commercial premises, hoping to eliminate fire hazards as soon as possible.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said 2,000 inspections had been carried out and around 600 fire hazard abatement notices had been issued in the past month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire services director also noted that an amendment bill will be tabled to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who violate fire safety regulations.

    Govt to shelve waste charging scheme: sources

    <![CDATA[<img alt="DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan says he believes the government will continue to step up promotional efforts on waste reduction to boost the community’s understanding of the matter. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754752_1_20240526154606.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say the government will shelve its plan to introduce a citywide waste charging scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The arrangement was originally scheduled to come into effect from August 1, but sources say the government will inform the Legislative Council on Monday of its plan to put it on the back-burner indefinitely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who's also chairman of Legco's Panel on Environmental Affairs, welcomed the news, saying this is not the right time to introduce the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials should consider a number of factors, such as the state of the city's economy and the availability of recycling services, before deciding when to bring back the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau added that he believes the government will continue to step up education and promotional efforts on waste reduction to boost the community’s understanding of the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said he would be "very disappointed" if the scheme is to be shelved indefinitely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong is facing a very serious waste crisis, and called on lawmakers not to overexaggerate the scheme's impact on the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please do not blow up part of the community's negative response or comment. The effects of the financial burden mentioned by some of the political parties only affect some of the sectors of the community," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government has already delayed the waste charging scheme twice in the past... the authorities should treat this law seriously and give the public the timeline for rolling out the scheme."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The convenor of a community project to support carers on Sunday said nine carer spaces will be set up across the city to identify caregivers and address their plight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Patrick Nip, convenor of the Advisory Committee of the Jockey Club Carer Space Project, said Hong Kong’s ageing population is a growing cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nip noted that some 240,000 people are providing long-term care for around 300,000 elderly citizens in the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Nip said it's important to remind carers to take care of their own mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How can we strengthen support for carers and remind them that they have their own needs too? Some don't see themselves as carers because they think it's their duty. Others might not be aware of their own mental state - even when they're on the verge of collapse. So I think an assessment is needed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carer spaces, located in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Ma On Shan, Kwai Fong, Tsing Yi, Tai Wai, Shek Kip Mei, Sai Wan Ho and Sham Shui Po, will provide counselling and assessment services for carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daytime respite services for the elderly will also be available at a cost of HK$30 for four hours, with exemptions for those facing financial difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nip, a former government official, said the five-year project is expected to benefit around 27,000 carers and 15,000 care recipients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the ultimate goal is to create a viable model for the administration to consider going forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most importantly, we hope to innovate boldly and try to find a feasible model in this pilot project. It can be replicated on a large scale, so the government can take over and it can be sustained. This is our goal," he explained.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said talks he held during his trip to Paris showed that these visits were conducive to helping others better understand the SAR's development, and clearing up misunderstandings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, the minister said he had been promoting the SAR's advantages to political and business leaders in France, and they were highly interested in the city’s latest developments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some meeting participants told us that it was very important for the SAR government to actively go out and contact friends from different sectors," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief said people he met during his French visit agreed that the SAR remains highly promising, with some describing the city as being as vibrant and charismatic as it was before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that he had been fostering exchanges between the two places in the business and cultural arenas, noting that he invited the organiser of a French tech conference, VivaTech, as well as the Théâtre National de Chaillot, to come to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said he will be leaving for San Francisco on Monday to promote cooperation between China and the United States in dealing with climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the current geopolitical situation is complicated, addressing climate change is the responsibility of the whole world. Countries must establish a stronger foundation for cooperation and smoother communication channels, so that the world can have a greater chance of success in moving towards zero carbon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said Hong Kong is sparing no efforts in becoming an international hub of green technology and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that he and other representatives will be sharing the SAR's knowledge and experience in developing a sustainable future in the Bay to Bay Dialogue and the US-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of the time-travelling robot cat Doraemon on Saturday got a sneak preview of a forthcoming exhibition, as crowds gathered along Victoria Harbour for the world's first-ever drone show devoted to the beloved Japanese animated character.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The display lasted for more than 10 minutes with large crowds filling the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people that RTHK spoke to said that the drone show was exciting, while others thought it was a little too short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saurabh Agarwal said he really enjoyed the accompanying sound and picture performance with his friends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was fantastic. We waited for more than an hour, and it was worth the wait. We actually missed the last show for drones," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time we just came early to get a good place. This was fantastic and it was the first time I see drones in Hong Kong so I was very excited."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really enjoyed it. It was brilliant. The drones performed brilliantly. I don't know anything about the cartoon character, but I really enjoyed the show," said Debra Gergson, who is visiting Hong Kong on vacation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Puneet Brar said she wished the show could have been longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really enjoyed the show and the graphics. It was an amazing production. I wish it was a little longer because I was enjoying myself a lot," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought it was really special and unique. You just can't see a drone show everyday."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the morning, visitors got to see dozens of huge models from the series at Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park in Sai Ying Pun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman, surnamed Chan, was among those who went to see the Doraemon figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is so cute. The character is part of the childhood memories of many people, so it's very attractive," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It would be nice to have a longer exhibition or displays around different parts of Hong Kong... so that adults and kids can all come and take photos."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Free Doraemon balloons were also handed out in several busy districts in Hong Kong, including Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Causeway Bay and Central, with most of them distributed in about two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The full exhibition, the first stop on a global tour and also listed on the government's "mega events calendar," gets under way on July 13 and runs until August 4, featuring a special animated short film.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam from the event organiser said the film depicts one of the characters, Gian, mostly known for being an aggressive bully in the series, holding a concert in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The film will be part of the paid exhibition, but fans can also visit large-scale figures of Doraemon for free at the Avenue of Stars.

    Runaway emu shocks passers-by in Tin Shui Wai

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rogue emu was spotted pounding the streets of Tin Shui Wai on Saturday morning, shocking residents and rapidly going viral on social media.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Emus are normally found in the Australian outback, rather than Hong Kong public housing estates, but video widely shared online showed one of the flightless birds exploring different parts of the town in the northern New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aside from the estate, the emu was spotted running up and down busy roads, at one point forcing a lorry driver to slam on the breaks to avoid a collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After calls from people who saw the runaway at the junction of Tin Sau Road and Tin Ying Road, inspectors from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals moved in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were joined in the search by police officers and officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three hours later, the emu found its way into the nearby wetlands park, where it was caught, uninjured, and handed over to the AFCD for safekeeping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials say they've so far been unable to contact the farm the emu came from.

    Wide range of mega events a must for HK: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should not limit the kind of mega events it stages, culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Saturday, dismissing concerns that an abundance of shows and exhibitions could diminish their appeal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR has more than 100 mega events scheduled for the latter half of this year, from sporting contests to summits, but lawmaker Doreen Kong earlier said she's worried that too many big events would lead to a loss of focus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Yeung said diversity was important to cater to different audiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For tourists, they may be travelling to Hong Kong for a week to participate in a mega event they are interested in...But in Hong Kong, it does seem that 200 mega events are a lot, with all sorts of shows and activities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that Hong Kong is a diverse place with many mega events, and different people who come here can find what they want to take part in. We also want to let everyone know that Hong Kong is capable and has hosted various types of mega events."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's mega events are expected to draw 1.7 million visitors, out of a predicted 46 million total arrivals. But the minister stressed that mega events were not the only away to attract tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not solely rely on one aspect to attract people. We already have a number of projects, for example, existing tourist hotspots and in-depth tours. The estimated figure also do not include the number of people attending concerts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we shouldn't only look at the mega events on the roster. It's more about the atmosphere of the city after holding mega events, and making the city more attractive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the administration was in talks with the filmmakers behind the hit local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" about turning its set into a tourist site. The film attracted a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and has sparked international interest in its setting: the long-demolished Kowloon Walled City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister also acknowledged the possibility of the filmmakers requiring the sets again to produce a prequel or sequel to the martial arts film.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmaker Tony Tse says building owners, like those at New Lucky House in Jordan, should be told that they are responsible for the premises' maintenance and repair. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754648_1_20240525111952.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Increasing penalties alone will not be enough to deal with the problem of property owners ignoring fire safety orders, a lawmaker said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tony Tse made the comments after the government said this week that it intended to submit an amendment bill to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who ignore such instructions. It follows the deaths of five people in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan, a building subject to a series of fire safety notices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials are proposing to raise the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tony Tse, who represents the architectural, surveying, planning and landscape sectors, said legislation alone was not the answer and that owners should be informed that they are responsible for carrying out maintenance and repair work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[For] those who have little knowledge or no knowledge about this area, we should all offer some sort of assistance. That could be coming from the government, or some professional institutions, as well as some volunteering persons who have knowledge about it," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee lawmaker Andrew Lam said that while it's "inevitable" that stricter penalties for non-compliance would be introduced, the government should strengthen inter-departmental cooperation to tackle such issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The group behind a 2019 protest song that's subject to a court injunction said on Friday evening that the distributor had now decided to remove it from all platforms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On social media, the group behind "Glory to Hong Kong" said it has expressed opposition to the decision, saying it hoped to have the song reinstated as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group said the song had been removed from iTunes and Apple Music in various regions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeal earlier granted a government request for a temporary injunction against anyone playing or performing the song with seditious intent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, has since restricted the viewing of 32 links related to the song in Hong Kong.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Algernon Yau, left, says Hong Kong businesses can do more to attract investors from the Middle East and Asean countries. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754529_1_20240524143042.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau says claims that Hong Kong was no longer the Pearl of the Orient and its status has been overtaken by Singapore were absolutely not true, citing the SAR’s unique advantage of its proximity to the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s not true at all. Hong Kong has the advantage over the others because we have the back-up of the motherland. We are a super connector and a value adder,” Yau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for commerce and economic development said Hong Kong is positioned to capture business opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, which has a population of 86 million with GDP of US$1.3 trillion. The size of the GBA economy is comparable to that of South Korea or some northern European countries, Yau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Using Hong Kong as a gateway going into the Greater Bay Area is our advantage,” Yau told RTHK’s Your Home Address programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also highlighted that Hong Kong is the only common law city in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The rule of law, free low of capital, good infrastructure and professional services… are all available in Hong Kong which are very competitive to any other economy in the world,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To attract more foreign businesses to operate in Hong Kong, Yau said, “We need to change”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister hailed a business trip led by the Chief Executive John Lee to the Middle East and Asean countries last year, adding that Hong Kong businesses need to look at how to accommodate new investors coming from those parts of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The whole world is changing, the situation is evolving and we have to look at new opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Without changing, we won’t be able to entertain the new investors, visitors or tourists coming from the Middle East especially,” the secretary said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau also revealed that Hong Kong will be hosting a Belt and Road summit in September as part of a month-long Belt and Road festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister, whose policy portfolio also covers broadcasting, said he is trying to foster a more dynamic environment for the industry. He said there are more programmes on RTHK about education and culture on the mainland.

    US sanctions will have no impact on DoJ: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said any US sanctions aimed at Hong Kong judges and officials will have no impact on the Department of Justice.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam's comment came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on a number of SAR officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said this was in response to what he described as "an intensifying crackdown on rights and freedoms" in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on his return from an official visit to the Middle East, Lam reiterated his opposition to any such sanctions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we have reiterated many times, these actions and statements violate fundamental principles of international law. Secondly, these remarks or expressions will absolutely not affect me personally or the work of our Department of Justice. They will not have the slightest impact whatsoever," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The justice chief also said he explained Hong Kong's common law system to the business sector in the Middle East during his five-day trip there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there are many opportunities for cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, as the SAR can help connect investors and businesspeople there to China and the rest of the world.

    Lawmakers differ on pushing or shelving waste charging

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday were divided on the way forward for the planned citywide waste charging scheme, with one believing the policy should not go to waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a paper to the Legislative Council, the administration said people who took part in a trial believed the measure was causing a nuisance to the public and complained the designated bags would be too expensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legislator Tik Chi-yuen, from the Third Side, said the city should continue pushing for the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have sufficient conditions to continue with the plan. It doesn't matter what the policy will be called, whether it's a second phase of the trial, or operating it in different modes," Tik told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should introduce this scheme to places with management capabilities, including public housing, subsidised housing, large-scale private residential estates, as well as premises of the government and the public sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But DAB lawmaker, Edward Lau, said the government should shelve the waste charging scheme "indefinitely". He said introducing the policy on schedule would cause chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should hold off on introducing the scheme and look into areas that should be improved. That's because many issues were reflected in the report and it's impossible to fail to deal with them," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only when conditions permit and the timing is right, then the government can bring it back to Legco for discussions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok Wai-keung from the Federation of Trade Unions said it could be worth amending the time frame in which to roll out the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other than strengthening our recycling facilities, we hope the government can provide a detailed timetable. If we are going to carry out works on waste charging and reduction, the government should say how many stages should there be," Kwok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said there should be a test run for everyone to take part in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Friday said a number of people who trialled the pay-as-you-throw scheme think the government should hold off on rolling out the plan to everyone in August, believing the measure was causing a nuisance to the public.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But in a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Environment and Ecology Bureau gave no indication of what would be next for the municipal solid waste charging scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials began trialling the scheme at 14 locations from April, including at public and private residential blocks, and people involved in the trial were provided with free designated garbage bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said the bags were used 70 percent of the time at shopping malls participating in the test run, but there were fewer residents who used them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The average usage rate [of designated bags] at public and private housing buildings ranged from only about 20 percent to more than 50 percent, and only around 20 percent at 'three-nil' buildings," the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "three-nil" building is one which does not have an owners' corporation or any form of residents' organisation, nor does it employ a property management company to manage the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said many residents thought charging for disposed waste was causing a nuisance and complained the bags would be too expensive, while voicing concerns that littering would happen more often once the measure took effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some also believed it was difficult to understand how to dispose of items larger than the designated bags, the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Residents polled] suggested to scrap waste charging or let society fully understand and prepare for it, thus it is not appropriate to introduce the scheme as scheduled on August 1," the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau noted that frontline cleaning staff had seen their workload increase from handling trash that was not thrown out properly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some expressed a concern about conflicts with residents when the policy was introduced or even breaking the law unknowingly, with certain individuals planning to quit because of the scheme, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For restaurants, shops and care homes, they pointed to a rise in operating costs and recommended improving the design of larger garbage bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration said certain locations, such as residential blocks, care homes, restaurants and government premises, saw a 10 to 20 percent decrease in the amount of garbage disposed during the test run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added there was a rise in the type and amount of recyclables collected.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association on Friday said its chairwoman, Josephine Ip, has resigned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On its website, the association said Ip's move was down to personal reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First vice-chairman Yu Sum-por will take over from Ip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) said it is aware of Ip's resignation and respects the decision made by her and the association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, the SAR government twice criticised Ip for remarks she made in public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, she said an event featuring competitors representing the Hong Kong SAR and Chinese Taipei had lifters from "13 countries".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another incident, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a slip of the tongue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports, and Tourism Bureau on Friday expressed its gratitude to the SF&OC for addressing Ip's blunders, which it described as "completely unacceptable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau again urged the SF&OC to enhance training for its affiliates, to prevent such incidents from happening again.

    DAB calls on govt to shelve waste charging scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday called on the government to shelve plans to roll out household waste charging, saying surveys it has carried out show this is what the majority of people want.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It added that authorities should not see the policy as the only means to reduce waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said only 18.4 percent of 810 people it polled by phone in April thought the pay-as-you-throw scheme should go ahead as planned in August, and only 15 percent of 750 people polled in May thought the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 30 percent of the interviewees said the policy should be delayed a third time, while 45 percent said it should be scrapped entirely, the DAB said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said people feel there are not enough recycling facilities, and that having to pay for designated bags for waste would be a financial burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said authorities should take more time to help Hong Kong get ready for the scheme, by building waste-to-energy infrastructure, setting up more recycling stations across the city and providing detailed recycling guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the administration can also provide cash rewards for those who recycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have a reward scheme to encourage citizens to [recycle] but now the scheme is that you do recycling and then you get some points, which can be used to redeem noodles or oil, that kind of thing. I think if you can redeem cash, you will have a better incentive," Quat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier in the week that even though the pay-as-you-go measure was made law by the previous administration, authorities should still put thought into how the scheme is executed.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Thursday said an outbreak of gastroenteritis at the Eastern Hospital has affected at least 43 staff members.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The CHP said the outbreak was likely caused by environmental contamination or person-to-person transmission of norovirus, noting that more than half of the affected staff members work in the East Block of the institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has ordered the hospital to disinfect the area immediately, along with other places the workers visited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the Hospital Authority earlier said some affected workers had consumed food from two hospital canteens, the CHP said not all of them had done so. It added that its officers did not find any irregularities when they inspected the cafeterias.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patients, aged between 20 and 62, are all in stable condition, the CHP added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) on Thursday confirmed that Kam Kee Catering Group has failed to settle around HK$3.1 million in MPF contributions and relevant surcharges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said the restaurant chain did not make MPF contributions for around 980 employees between February and March this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MPFA on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in the High Court against the company, on behalf of affected employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reminded employers that it is their legal responsibility to make MPF contributions on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department, meanwhile, said it is handling claims of unpaid salaries and other legal matters from around 60 Kam Kee employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It called on other workers to get in touch if they have any queries or concerns.

    Fabric market beautified for designers and tourists

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The beautification project "Fabrimark" aims to showcase the textile and clothing industry in Sham Shui Po. Photo: RTHK' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754401_1_20240523171801.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Thursday said a makeover of Sham Shui Po's fabric market could attract young designers and tourists to the venue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sham Shui Po Fabric Market relocated to Tung Chau Street from Yen Chow Street Hawker Bazaar last year to make way for public housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market currently has space for 50 stalls with 30 currently in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The district officer of Sham Shui Po, Paul Wong, said that bright orange reflective panels that had been installed at the venue represent hope for the fashion and design industry in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you're interested in fashion design and DIYs, Sham Shui Po has been your dream destination for many years. Giving these new destinations a push, we can attract more young designers or people who are interested in the design creative industry to come to Sham Shui Po to mingle with other designers and take inspiration," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the beautification project, which they have dubbed "Fabrimark", would bring more exposure and business to the market, while maintaining the textile trade's heritage and history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a strong and long heritage of textile and clothing industry in Sham Shui Po, so riding on the opening of the Hong Kong Design Centre in the fourth quarter of this year, we think this is a good opportunity to combine the new development and our heritage to showcase the fashion design industry, the design industry in general and the textile and clothing heritage of Sham Shui Po."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the beautification work would last around nine months, costing approximately HK$50,000 per month, adding there was an opportunity for an extension depending on its maintenance.

    Drainage Services steps up flood prevention efforts

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Drainage Services Department is building a 64,000 cubic metre water storage tank in Kwun Tong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754400_1_20240523171706.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Drainage Services Department said it was taking proactive measures to mitigate the risk of flooding as the rainy season approaches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a press briefing on Thursday, the department stressed that flooding cannot be totally be avoided due to climate change but said it would adopt a multi-pronged approach to reduce the risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides more frequent inspections of the drainage system, it also plans to use artificial intelligence in more scenarios, such as deploying AI-powered robots to clear obstructions in drains and manholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok also said the department was developing an AI analysis tool to gather rainstorm data to help predict floods in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are collaborating with a university team…we need to collect a large amount of data on site to train the computer, to recognise flooding and also to predict it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Having to collect the information from [the Hong Kong Observatory] from the coming rainstorm data, we hope the AI model can predict the water depth in the near future during the rainstorms.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a demonstration for the media, the department also showcased the construction progress of a storm water storage tank on Sau Nga Road in Kwun Tong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tank is capable of storing around 64,000 cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to 26 standard swimming pools, and is part of a major project to improve drainage in the surrounding area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HK$930 million water storage tank was expected to be completed in 2028 and Mok said the price tag was reasonable given the scale and complexity of the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the heavy rainfall, we need to temporarily store the rainwater in the storage tank and wait until the bad weather and the heavy rainfall has gone,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will discharge the rainwater subsequently when the rainfall intensity has reduced…because of the quite large volume of the excavation and the quite large volume of the tank, the cost of the storage scheme is at that level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the department’s ongoing review of flooding black spots would be completed by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of the Precious Blood Hospital in Sham Shui Po said on Thursday that the institution will remain non-profit making despite its decision to partner up with a private medical group to expand services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Catholic charity Caritas said it will work with Parkway Medical Services to redevelop and expand the 87-year-old hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Joseph Lui, director of medical services at Caritas, said the hospital will remain a Catholic institution, upholding its religious values and mission to serve the local community and the needy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Kenneth Tsang, CEO of Parkway, said new services at the hospital will focus on meeting the needs of the growing elderly population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because the community, not just for Sham Shui Po but for the whole of Hong Kong, is becoming more and more of an elderly population. More than 20 percent of our population is elderly," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the focus of the hospital will really be on what the people of Hong Kong need. The 20 percent of people who are old, they may have eye problems, they may have ear problems, they may have problems related to the deterioration of age. So those are all the areas that we're going to focus on in the hospital."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital was established by the Sisters of the Precious Blood during the Second World War to provide medical care to the sick and injured.
