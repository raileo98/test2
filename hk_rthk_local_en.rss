<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to ban flavoured cigarettes will deter some tourists and businesspeople from coming to Hong Kong, a lawmaker warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is among 10 new measures aimed at reducing the number of smokers in the city, with others including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up if they're in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu told RTHK he was worried some people would think twice about coming to Hong Kong when they hear about the flavoured cigarette ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Fruit-flavoured cigarettes are sold in all parts of the world. Assuming people are not allowed to purchase these cigarettes, it would mean that their freedom of choice is being restricted,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If some of these people are used to smoking fruit-flavoured cigarettes in their own countries, and they visit Hong Kong where such products are prohibited, they would then think twice before travelling to the SAR for tourism or business.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Henry Tong, who chairs the Council on Smoking and Health, said he was in favour of the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really welcome the government's new measure... banning flavoured tobacco products would make cigarette smoking much less attractive to young people and female smokers," he said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Secretary for Health, Eddie Lee, meanwhile, said the government is adopting a "gradual and systemic" approach to making smoking culturally unacceptable in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bar Association on Friday expressed regret over the resignations of two top court judges, and said their departure would not affect the court's judicial functions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its remarks came after two non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption, both from the UK – tendered their resignations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Bar respects their personal decision and is also grateful for their contributions to the development of our jurisprudence and the rule of law in Hong Kong," the association wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Bar strongly believes that their resignations will not affect the ability of our apex court in discharging its judicial functions and has every confidence in the independence of our judicial system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Law Society said it is grateful to all current and past non-permanent judges for their "faithful and fearless discharge of their important role in the administration of justice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its president Chan Chak-ming said the society supports keeping overseas non-permanent judges in Hong Kong, as stated in the Basic Law.

 Police said they had arrested three people who allegedly insulted the national anthem ahead of a World Cup qualifying match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China were playing against Iran at the Hong Kong Stadium on Thursday in a 2026 World Cup qualifying match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said three people, aged between 18 and 31, turned their backs towards the pitch when the national anthem was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were arrested on suspicion of insulting the national anthem, and are being detained for further investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Anthem Ordinance came into effect in 2020, stating that people must stand solemnly and must not behave in a disrespectful way when the national anthem is played.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary said two non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption, both from the UK – have tendered their resignations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung of the Court of Final Appeal “notes with regret” the resignations. He said overseas non-permanent judges, including Lords Collins and Sumption, have made valuable contributions to the top court over the years, and that the Judiciary is committed to upholding the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive, John Lee, also expressed regret at the resignations. Lee noted that Lord Collins of Mapesbury had stated that he continued to "have the fullest confidence in the Court and the total independence of its members."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Secretary for Justice, Paul Lam, said the Department of Justice (DoJ) expresses regret at the judges' resignations, but was grateful for their past contributions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Collins of Mapesbury has been a non-permanent judge of Hong Kong’s highest court since 2011; Lord Sumption since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the pair’s resignations, there are four Hong Kong non-permanent judges and eight non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions at the Court of Final Appeal, with Justice Allsop from Australia the most recent appointee earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum number of non-permanent judges is 30.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and opposed the House of Representatives of the United States Congress for introducing a resolution which it said “smeared and slandered” the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance as well as law enforcement actions taken by HKSAR law enforcement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR administration said, "The US House of Representatives grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China, violating international law and the basic norms governing international relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSAR will not be intimidated and will continue to resolutely safeguard national security in accordance with the law," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also said the US was "in no position to point its finger" at the SAR for legitimately passing legislation to safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the SAR's legal framework in safeguarding national security was in line with international human rights standards, and the extraterritorial effect for the offences endangering national security also fully aligns with the principles of international law.

    Govt plans to invite red minibuses to go green by July

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Thursday said it planned to invite eligible red minibus operators to switch to green routes next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the government consulted the sector last month and received positive feedback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It planned to invite red minibus route operators, who had already joined the HK$2 fare scheme, to switch to green routes, to further ensure the quality of minibus services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said about 70 red minibus routes had joined the fare scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said criteria would be set for those who wished to go green, such as requiring minibus routes to operate for at least five years, have only one fixed route and offer whole-day services, and the route must be run by only one operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to invite eligible red minibus operators to switch to green routes within the month of July, and the department said it would ensure all routes meet the conditions for operating public light buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, red minibuses are allowed to operate across the territory, and their routes, frequency and fares are not subject to any restrictions.

    CE urged to step in to end HKU appointment conflict

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former council members and alumni of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have called on Chief Executive John Lee to put an end to the infighting at the institution, saying they had lost faith in the council's chairperson Priscilla Wong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They wrote a letter to Lee, who is also the university's chancellor, saying the council had appointed several interim vice-presidents without consulting HKU president and vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the council is tasked with giving advice and monitoring HKU's management, but does not directly deal with administrative affairs, adding the body's move had sparked conflicts in HKU and affected its normal operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Lee to step in promptly, or people would have the impression the government had appointed the council chairperson to control HKU and sideline the president, which would harm Hong Kong's international image.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the letter's signatories, former executive councillor Fanny Law, told RTHK she "doesn't have an opinion on who should be the vice-presidents," but she cared about the procedures, HKU's reputation and the city's image.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party legislator Regina Ip, who sits on HKU's court, an overseeing and legislative body comprising university and lay members, said she hopes the conflict can be settled soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personally I think vice-presidents are part of the president's team. No matter who has the power to appoint them, they should consult the president thoroughly. It's better if the president gets along with the vice-presidents and they can work together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Chief Executive's Office said Lee had asked the Education Bureau to comprehend the situation before reporting to him, adding that people would expect HKU, a successful university, to have good governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang had earlier criticised the council's action in an email to HKU teaching staff and students, saying it violated established procedures and severely undermined the institution's "century-old academic autonomy".

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A survey by Hong Kong Unison revealed that about 57 percent of Nepalese individuals found discrimination to be a serious problem in the SAR. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756364_1_20240606174406.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A group advocating for racial equality on Thursday called on the government to offer language and cultural courses to Nepalese parents and youths to help them integrate into Hong Kong society and prepare them with skills for better employment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A survey by Hong Kong Unison found that one in five Nepalese youths had been sent back to Nepal by their parents for reasons including family problems, forced marriage and drug abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Tse, executive director of the organisation, said authorities need to boost education measures to help local Nepalese youths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They should really put their top priority in the field of education, particularly in the learning of Chinese so that if Nepalese students are doing well in school, hopefully they would be successful in their academic career and then have some sort of social mobility," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, unfortunately, because of the language barrier and the lack of education, many of them can't finish secondary school. Even if they can finish secondary school, they would end up finding a really low-level kind of job which is not really good for them in the long run."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 268 adolescents and young adults were interviewed, with almost half saying their biggest concern was the language barrier and the lack of educational support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Limbu Eliza, a Nepalese youth who was born and raised in Hong Kong, said she personally struggled with discrimination and learning Cantonese growing up, which made schooling and finding a job very difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most companies don't hire our ethnic minority (EM) people. Whenever they see you are EM people, [they] don't want to hire you. They will just reject you immediately. No need for interview, you can just go, which is I think unfair for us," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of them, even though they know Cantonese, but [companies] judge us by our colour, our face, our culture, and that is why they will always reject us. I think that is the most difficult thing [about] finding a job in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation also recommended special programmes tailored to Nepalese individuals to combat drug abuse, after the survey noted 70 percent of youth found drug abuse to be a significant problem.

 RTHK understands that a man known for challenging government policies in court has been arrested on suspicion of scamming the authorities out of different kinds of social benefits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested a man surnamed Kwok, 85, in Cheung Chau on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said he's Kwok Cheuk-kin, often known as the king of judicial reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the man is suspected of making false statements over his income and assets, for the alleged purpose of deceiving the government to receive subsidies such as public housing, fruit money, social security and legal aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the alleged deception took place between 2013 and 2022, and the arrest was made after thorough investigation by the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the suspect was released on bail and stressed that fraud carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in jail.

    E-cigarettes, smoking in a queue to be banned

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-cigarettes, flavoured cigarettes and lighting up while in a queue are set to be banned in Hong Kong, as part of measures designed to bring about a "cultural change" when it comes to smoking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A ban on selling or importing alternative smoking products (ASP) came into force more than two years ago, but it is still legal to possess them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee on Thursday said the government plans to outlaw e-cigarettes and similar products completely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One should not be able to have any legal means to purchase or to get hold of such ASP. So anyone who is still using ASP currently... presumably they are using the stocks that they purchased before April 2022," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So a reasonable assumption is that by a certain time... if they possessed any ASP, should have already consumed all of the remaining leftover."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other planned measures aimed at cutting the number of smokers in the SAR include removing branding from cigarette packaging and a ban on smoking while in queues for public transport, theme parks or medical facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoke-free areas will also be extended to the entrances and exits of all childcare centres, schools and homes for the elderly. The fine for smoking in smoke-free areas will be doubled to HK$3,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Existing laws banning the sale of cigarettes to under-18s will be extended to cover those who offer them to minors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The key principle is that we want to protect our youngsters, our next generation. So what we are doing now is actually an education process, a cultural change, a behavioural change," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think another important aspect is that through education and promotion, we will educate our young people that they should not receive tobacco products. At the same time, we send a very clear message to the adults that one should not sell, nor should one provide such tobacco products to our young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said the harm of smoking should not be sugar-coated, so flavoured cigarettes will also be banned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These flavoured cigarettes with additives are actually like an advertisement trying to hide the irritating taste of the smoke and at the same time hiding the harmful effect of all these tobacco products to make it like a sugar coating on a toxic product," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To combat illicit cigarettes, the government will introduce a duty-paid cigarette labelling system and double the fine for smuggling illicit cigarettes to HK$2 million, while increasing the jail term from two to seven years. In addition, the government will continue to increase tobacco duty to discourage smoking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said the government aims to table the legislative amendments required before the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael, a cigarette smoker, told RTHK that more people will use conventional tobacco products when electronic cigarettes are completely banned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that would be illegal, then more people would be returning to buying cigarettes. Because most of them, they try to quit smoking with the electronic cigarettes such as vape," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But then now, if they're going to ban it, then I think it'll be much more difficult for people to quit smoking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-smoker surnamed Chan said she welcomes the government's plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I don't smoke, I support it. I don't really want to inhale second-hand smoke. In the past, for example, when queuing or taking the elevator, there would often be someone next to me smoking. I would just walk away. I wouldn't hang around," she said.

    Privacy watchdog clears exams body over charges

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Privacy Commissioner says the exams regulator didn't violate the law regarding charges for marking record and exam script checks. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756346_1_20240606154522.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog on Thursday dismissed complaints the local exams regulator had violated privacy laws by overcharging public exam candidates for their marking records and exam script checks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The law stipulates that organisations cannot charge a fee higher than the lowest possibly imposed for people seeking a copy of their personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Examinations and Assessment Authority turned electronic and stopped providing hard copies for those seeking their records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It lowered the fee for checking the first subject by HK$20 to HK$380, and kept the fee for each additional subject unchanged at HK$104.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four candidates who sat last year's DSE exams then filed complaints to the Privacy Commissioner, saying they were charged too much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an investigation, privacy commissioner Ada Chung said the fees charged were already lower than the directly related necessary costs, such as those for payroll and computer operating time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The commissioner found that the fees imposed by the [authority] for complying with the data access requests were not excessive and it had not contravened [the ordinance]," she said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One complainant also argued the exams body had been overcharging for a decade starting from 2012, saying it actually retained scanned copies of the records but only gave people hard copies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chung also said this was unsubstantiated, saying the authority was only providing the data in one form and therefore didn't violate the law.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There will be more cooperation between the creative industries in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, Culture Secretary Kevin Yeung said on Thursday at an annual meeting on cultural exchanges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “This year's meeting has been very successful, with many collaborative projects showing positive development. It's very encouraging,” he said at the 22nd Greater Pearl River Delta Cultural Cooperation Meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope that this conference framework will guide cultural exchange and cooperation between the three regions, and elevate the depth and breadth of our collaboration to a new level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that over the next five years, the SAR government will allocate HK$135 million to support local art groups and artists in exchange programmes within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also plans to bring more local cultural events, including the Hong Kong Pop Culture Festival, to the bay area, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong’s culture and tourism director general, Li Bin, said creating a well-known cultural tourism brand in the region is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that promotions for art performances and exhibitions will be more closely connected, with more interactions among official accounts on WeChat, Douyin and Xiaohongshu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Macau’s cultural affairs minister, Leong Wai-man, said the city hosted over 2,000 large-scale performances and more than 10,000 cultural events last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Macau could play the role as a major entertainment hub in the bay area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s flagship carrier Cathay Pacific on Thursday announced that it will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, from October 28.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airline has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Saudi Air Connectivity Program, which comes under Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Cathay Pacific’s CEO Ronald Lam said the new flights will help business and tourism prosper in both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Riyadh is a very vibrant city. It is the capital and financial centre of Saudi Arabia. By having direct flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh, we will be contributing to the prosperity of business, trade and tourism between China and Saudi Arabia,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme's CEO, Majid Khan, said the launch of the direct flights will bring more tourists to both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is one of the key markets in terms of tourism and trade from both sides. So we believe Cathay, we're going to grow the point-to-point traffic from both sides between Hong Kong and Riyadh and vice versa, but also the traffic to domestic Saudi Arabia and to the network beyond Hong Kong, where Cathay has a vast network,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay axed a previous service to Riyadh in 2017.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The SAR government has issued a statement setting the record straight about both the SAR and China. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756265_1_20240606003614.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday hit back at criticism by "some individuals" of the city's  economic and financial development, which it said had "clearly overlooked the existing advantages and the current positive development momentum of Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said in a statement that it intended to set the record straight, saying China's real economic growth rates in the first quarter and for all of 2023 were both above five percent, "ranking it among the fastest-growing major economies in the world".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It quoted an International Monetary Fund study which had concluded that the Mainland economy contributed to more than 30 per cent of global economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the SAR was also growing steadily, increasing by 3.3 per cent in 2023, and notching up year-on-year real gross domestic product growth of 2.7 percent. It said it was estimated to grow by 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also defended the city's status as a financial hub, saying Hong Kong stocks market capitalisaion exceeds HK$33 trillion, which is 10 times higher than at the time of the handover in 1997, while Stock Connect had also brought about a cumulative northbound and southbound capital flows of more than 1.8 trillion yuan and HK$3.1 trillion respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These figures demonstrate that Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, has fully utilised its ability to mobilise both Mainland and foreign capital, and will continue to play a key role in helping to 'bring in' international enterprises and investors, as well as assisting mainland enterprises to 'go out',"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also singled out other highlights in the stock market, including the average daily transaction volume of Exchange Traded Funds on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange exceeding HK$13 billion in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the China Securities Regulatory Commission had also recently announced five new measures to support the development of Hong Kong's financial sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the one country, two systems principle was the cornerstone of the city's prosperity, and the Basic Law protected freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its successful implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law and Safeguarding National Security Ordinance had "brought about a safe and stable environment conducive to investment and financial development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Early this year, a survey conducted by a major foreign chamber of commerce reflected that nearly 80 per cent of its members interviewed had confidence in the rule of law in Hong Kong, and nearly 70 per cent of them also indicated that the operation of their enterprises had not been affected by the National Security Law," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It underlined Hong Kong's status in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Various data and facts not only reflect the performance of Hong Kong's economic and financial development, but more importantly, highlight Hong Kong's unique advantages and strategic position under the 'one country, two systems' principle, as well as its resilience and flexibility, in the face of global instability," it said. "Despite the fact that external environment will remain complicated, the Mainland and Hong Kong's economic growth is steadily improving, and even in a faster pace than some developed economies."

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756251_1_20240605220920.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president and vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Zhang Xiang, on Wednesday confirmed he wasn't told about new senior staff appointments by the HKU council, saying it severely undermined the institution's "century-old academic autonomy".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an email to HKU teaching staff and students, Zhang said the council's move to appoint several interim vice-presidents without consulting him violated established procedures and disregarded the fundamentals of good governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the University of Hong Kong Ordinance and Statutes, the president was granted the authority to appoint temporary senior management officers, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Neither were the nominations for these interim vice-presidents recommended by me, nor was I consulted about them. The university management did not have prior knowledge of these appointments at all," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stability and development of our University, as well as the reputation of Hong Kong, are now at risk, not to mention the negative impact on our efforts to attract global talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes reportedly include a demotion for Richard Wong, Zhang’s right-hand man and deputy vice-chancellor, who had served as the university’s interim provost since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that Wong had been appointed as a vice-president and would oversee institutional advancement, while his original post would be taken up by Vivian Yam, a professor at the science faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Zhang said he was thrilled that HKU had ranked higher than ever before in the new QS World University Rankings, adding he was dedicated to leading the institution to new heights and positioning it alongside the world's leading universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU climbed up nine places to 17 on QS’s list of the world’s top universities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 16,000 pupils - or 84 percent of the intake - were accepted into their top three schools in this year's central allocation of Primary One places on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau earlier announced that a total of 19,204 children took part in the central allocation exercise, and the overall satisfaction rate was 92.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau reminded parents to register their child with the school allocated from next Tuesday to Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some parents were happy with the outcome, while others went to their targeted schools for interviews as a last resort to compete for the remaining few places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parent lined up outside a primary school in Yau Ma Tei from 9am for "door knocking" and tried his luck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We live nearby and the school is famous. [My kid] has prepared by earning some certificates and participated in competitions. But I'm not very optimistic, because the school is quite popular," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the Confucian Tai Shing Primary School in Wong Tai Sin said it was unfair that it was only allowed to operate one Primary One class instead of two, saying it had admitted at least 31 pupils this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the bureau said the decision was based on established mechanisms because the total number of students admitted was less than 41.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two social welfare groups on Wednesday introduced a new teaching kit to help teenagers with autism make friends, saying they often find it hard to fit in.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Family Planning Association and Wai Ji Christian Service worked together to design games and story cards that teach autistic teens to interact with others in different social scenarios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maggie Fung, a clinical psychologist with the Christian group, said autistic children struggle to read other people’s emotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Their main difficulty is they don't really recognise the facial expression or the reaction from others. Therefore, they might have a lot of difficulties recognising their reaction and coming up with an appropriate response to them,” she said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Wai-wai, an education officer from the association, said the teaching kit helps them understand what's expected in social situations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With these stories shown to them, they can actually say, 'Oh, this is what people expected, this is what's going wrong.' So they can learn from seeing. They can learn from understanding,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report published by the Census and Statistics Department showed that 22,400 people are living with autism in Hong Kong as of 2020, making up 0.3 percent of the total population.

    Subpar taxi fleets could be banned: authorities

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government hopes new taxi fleets will drive up service quality. File photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756208_1_20240605164135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New taxi fleets set to hit the streets of Hong Kong could be suspended from doing business if their service quality isn't up to scratch, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department is currently vetting 15 applications for taxi fleet licences, with up to five successful bidders expected to be announced in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to questions from lawmaker Edward Leung, Acting Transport Secretary Liu Chun-san said taxi fleet operators will need to take part in a mid-term appraisal and their performance would be taken into account should they wish to renew their licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transport commissioner would be able to initiate an inquiry should a fleet fail to meet the required standards and a number of sanctions would be available, such as a licence suspension or withdrawing certain taxis from the fleet, Liu said in a written reply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year saw a 75 percent surge in complaints against taxi drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-third of the 1,006 cases filed to the authorities were related to drivers refusing hire, while another 340 cabbies were accused of overcharging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But authorities cautioned that the jump in complaints came against a low base of comparison in 2022, when Hong Kong was still curtailed by Covid restrictions.

    Five arrested over suspected fake drugs, cosmetics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Wednesday said they had arrested five people on suspicion of selling counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs and cosmetic products in Mong Kok worth around HK$620,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The arrestees were suspected to have violated the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested were three men and two women aged between 28 and 90.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An investigator from the Customs and Excise Department, Kenny Chan, said that salespersons, working for a supplier, brought the goods to retailers to sell at low prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspected counterfeit items were found in an operation on Tuesday, when officers searched three retail outlets in Mong Kok and a warehouse in Fo Tan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer said it was difficult for customers to tell the difference between genuine and counterfeit goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he noted that while the packaging and bottles of the suspected counterfeits looked real enough, some of the anti-counterfeiting features were not done in a detailed manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you compare the real goods to the counterfeit ones, the pattern at the bottom of the bottles is different. It's smooth for the genuine goods and relatively rough for the fakes," Chan said at a press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can also see that the trademarks printed on the genuine goods are clear whereas for the counterfeits they are not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan believed that some of the counterfeit goods had already been sold on the market, but officers had not received any complaints from the public so far, such as the products causing skin rashes or other more serious issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said samples of the goods would be sent to the government laboratory for tests.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tourism project involving the use of augmented reality (AR) technology has been expanded to Lei Yue Mun, allowing people to learn more about the cultural and historical development of the area famous for its seafood.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Visitors can use a mobile app to scan AR markers at six locations along the harbourfront to see a panorama mixing photos from the past and drawings of what the surroundings looked like from the 1920s to the 1970s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Narrative texts describe the changes to iconic landmarks, such the Tin Hau Temple, Sam Ka Tsuen and the past quarry zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "City in Time" project was launched by the Tourism Commission in 2021, with the initial phase featuring popular tourist spots like Central, The Peak and Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Project manager Yip Tsz-lam said the programme has now been extended to other communities rich in culture or history, such as Lei Yue Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most people know Lei Yue Mun as a seafood paradise, but through our research, we discovered that there are many other interesting historical values in Lei Yue Mun, like the quarrying history, the Hakka culture and also the Tin Hau Temple,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about the panoramic artwork. Visitors can also gain in-depth understanding through the historical narratives and also the old photos.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said it took the research team half a year to gather about 300 old photos to recreate a realistic scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are not many old photos available from universities or any other sources. We rely on the descriptions from villagers and they also provided us with a lot of photos from their family albums,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we're very grateful that a restaurant owner provided us with a photo of him and his father in the 1970s. We provided that photo to the artist and the artist drew them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip added that the programme will later be expanded to Tai Hang and Kowloon City.

    Courtesy ambassadors to improve taxi relations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Taxi Council on Wednesday said that courtesy ambassadors would be stationed at some of the SAR's busiest taxi stands, including at checkpoints and the airport, from June 6 to August 27, to distribute leaflets and souvenirs to passengers and drivers to encourage better service.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The exercise is part of this year's annual taxi courtesy campaign in conjunction with the Tourism Board's hospitality campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, the Taxi Council's chairman Ryan Wong said he hopes this new measure could improve the image of taxi drivers, and also improve communication between drivers and passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have hired university students to be our courtesy ambassadors. Our council has provided them with some training so that they understand the purpose of our campaign and also the services they will provide," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, in addition to our courtesy ambassadors, members of the council will also be on site. If there are questions that the students cannot answer, like industry-related questions, our members can help can help out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick added that service would also be enhanced with more taxis incorporating electronic payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand that there are several systems that are available and [are being] installed in the taxi fleets now," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By the introduction of the taxi fleet management scheme by the government, they are required to put this electronic payment system in there, so I'm sure that the situation will start to improve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who RTHK spoke to said that taxi services have improved over the years, but there are other aspects that could make journeys more enjoyable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daria, who takes a taxi two to three times a week, said a lot of old taxis have been replaced with more comfortable and newer vehicles, but said it is difficult to hail a cab, especially during peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe have a better app, but right now, it doesn't work properly so for me, I cannot really order a taxi. The taxi drivers never pick up my order, so if they can [provide] more digital [options] to find taxis faster, it would be great," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, I've never experienced any rude behaviour to be honest, but also I know on the news, there are a few accidents involved where taxi drivers are quite old. I think authorities should limit the age as well because it might be dangerous for both the passenger and for the taxi driver."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krauchi, who takes a taxi to work every day, said it would be better if cabs accepted electronic payments, especially with rival Uber being cashless.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for new overnight high-speed trains to the mainland went on sale on Wednesday, with the first service to Beijing selling out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains to the capital and Shanghai will run Friday-Monday from June 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Queues for tickets formed at West Kowloon Station, while mainland app 12306 showed no places left for the first train to Beijing, although people could join a wait list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were really happy when we saw the news [regarding the new services], so we immediately decided to travel to Shanghai," a woman told RTHK at West Kowloon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The journey time was 19 hours before, and it's only 11 hours now. The duration is eight hours shorter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another woman said she arrived at the station 90 minutes before tickets went on sale, to book a spot on a train to Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the price, it's a bit expensive. Our tickets cost one thousand dollars each. But it's not convenient for us to travel by plane. We're old people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man said he normally drives to the mainland, but wants to try the overnight train instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically, I have to go to Beijing once a year and I like trying new things," he said.

    Deficit stops us giving bigger pay rises, says govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it hopes a 3 percent pay rise will boost morale among civil servants. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756158_1_20240605115952.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Wednesday said the government's financial situation doesn't allow it to give staff pay rises as high as levels indicated by the latest pay trend survey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a proposed 3 percent increase for all civil servants, after the survey pointed to rises of between 4.01 and 5.47 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said on RTHK that the decision to give an across-the-board rise wasn't made out of convenience, and many factors were considered, including a budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under such a situation, we hope the pay rise can be a form of recognition of the work of civil servants, regardless of which grade they belong to," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also hope to maintain everyone's morale, or go even further and boost morale. We think this is the appropriate level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the same programme, the chairman of the Civil Servants General Union, Fung Chuen-chung, said people who think civil service pay should be frozen because of the deficit are missing the point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there's an important point that society at large has overlooked. For quite some time, there's been a high turnover rate for civil servants. It's also very hard to hire new people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So [the proposed 3 percent rise] hasn't taken these important factors into account."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said lower-ranking civil servants are particularly disappointed, because the survey pointed to a 5.47 percent increase for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said she understands that such workers had hoped for more, but said in 18 of the past 31 years, lower-ranking workers received the same increases as middle-ranking staff, even when the survey indicated smaller rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An honorary chairman of the Senior Government Officers Association, Lee Fong-chung, also expressed disappointment that the proposed rise doesn't match the pay trend survey levels, but said at least it will help staff cope with inflation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong once again has three universities in the world's top 50, with two more narrowly missing the cut, organisers of the QS World University Rankings revealed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University ranked higher than ever before, while the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology returned to the top 50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU was up nine places at seventeenth overall while CUHK climbed eleven places to 36th in the world. Meanwhile UST rose 13 places, ranking 47th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ranking is based on a study of 1,500 universities around the world. Evaluators consider nine indicators, including academic reputation, what employers think of an institution, the ratio of students to faculty and whether the university has many international students, staff and global networks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CUHK saw its scores improve in most areas, most notably sustainability, where it finished 132 places higher than last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said in a statement that it is highly regarded for its environmental concepts and leadership in creating and applying sustainable development solutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CUHK also earned a perfect score for its ratio of international faculty and a high score for academic citations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its president, Rocky Tuan, said the results demonstrate CUHK's commitment to academic excellence and ability to compete with world-class universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, HKUST said that despite being a newer institution, its embraces innovative teaching methods and resources that adapt to evolving societal need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was making the most of new technologies like artificial intelligence to enhance student learning and promote the SAR's goal of becoming an international innovation and technology centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Polytechnic University ranked 57th, continuing a climb in recent years, while City University was 62nd. Two other local universities were also ranked: Baptist University was placed joint 252nd while Lingnan University was in the 711-720 band.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was first overall, ahead of Imperial College London and Oxford University. The National University of Singapore ranked best in Asia and eighth overall. Peking University was China's best, finishing 14th in the world.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Tuesday that they’d made four arrests around Causeway Bay in connection with offences including breaches of national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a 68-year-old woman was arrested for alleged offences relating to seditious intention under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance after shouting slogans on Yee Wo Street in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also said a 24-year-old man and a 69-year-old woman were arrested on the same street. The man is suspected of assaulting two police officers while the woman was held for disorderly conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile a 23-year-old man was arrested at Hing Fat Street on suspicion of assaulting two park security guards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had increased their patrols in Causeway Bay and Victoria Park, with officers taking aside a number of people throughout the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the afternoon, an officer warned a man – who was holding up a large poster near Sogo department store – that he was disrupting public order, and demanded that he stop. The man was then brought to a police vehicle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At night, officers patrolled East Point Road and also brought a number of people to police vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, police presence was also stepped up at Victoria Park, where they set up a tent. Officers requested some people in the park to enter the tent. They were released after being searched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to queries, the force said it would make appropriate operational deployments in light of threats to public safety, public order and national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police said three men and two women, aged between 27 and 88, were taken back to the station on suspicion of breaching public peace. All were later allowed to leave.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said tickets for overnight high-speed trains between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong would be available for sale from Wednesday noon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overnight trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and West Kowloon Station from June 15 from Fridays to Mondays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR said tickets would be available from Wednesday noon on the mainland's 12306 ticketing website or mobile app, and at ticket counters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fares for one-way trips between Hong Kong and Beijing would be approximately between HK$937 and HK$1,448, while those between Hong Kong and Shanghai would be approximately between HK$682 and HK$2,128.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung welcomed the new arrangements which enhanced the services provided by the Hong Kong section of the express rail link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new sleeper trains...tailored to meet the passenger needs and provide them with a more convenient, comfortable and high-quality cross-boundary rail service, enhancing the travel experience for both business and leisure passengers," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Beijing resident said the new arrangement further encouraged him to visit Hong Kong one day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't like to travel by plane, so if high-speed trains have sleeping coaches, I won't feel tired even it's a long trip," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who's visiting Hong Kong, said she could manage time better if she travelled by high-speed trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to weather conditions these days, the situation of flight delays is very serious. My flight was delayed for almost eight hours, so travelling by high-speed trains may be more convenient," she said.

    Mainland tourism delegation wowed by HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Tuesday said an ongoing visit from a mainland trade delegation will provide more opportunities for the tourism industry and boost Hong Kong's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Representatives from eight mainland cities recently added to the Individual Visit Scheme are visiting the SAR to familiarise themselves with the city, to help them promote it as a destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delegation member Huang Ning, deputy general manager of a Harbin travel agency, said the group's visit will bring new momentum to the tourism market and foster economic and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The flight time from Harbin to Hong Kong is five hours. In the past, most of us would usually spend a night in Shenzhen before arriving in Hong Kong, but direct flights make it more convenient for passengers and more attractive to go straight to Hong Kong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People can go whenever they want. The launch [of Harbin's inclusion in the scheme] plus direct flights have really facilitated the desire for Harbin people to visit Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Xiaochun, general manager of Gansu Legend Travel Co. Ltd, said the shopping experience in Hong Kong is incredible, adding that she hopes the duty-free allowance for visitors can be increased from the current 5,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone is very friendly. This time we really felt that they were very hospitable. I really hope that the cap for the allowance can be increased. Our time here yesterday was too short. We felt that we didn't have enough time to go shopping," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The shopping experience is very pleasant here. We bought so many sports brand products here and also a lot of Hong Kong delicacies and snacks. The snacks here are very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang Tenghong, executive director of Tibet Tourism Investment and Tourism Service Co. Ltd, said he was impressed by the attractions the delegation visited, including Central Market and Tai Kwun, adding that the SAR offers great food and scenery.

    Legco supports expanded sex offender checks
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco supports expanded sex offender checks" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756054_1_20240604161222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday expressed support towards the government's plans to expand checks on sex offender records to gradually cover the self-employed, volunteers and existing workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The current system allows voluntary checks on prospective employees seeking jobs related to children and the mentally incapable, meaning the employer needs the consent of the job-seeker to perform the check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials now want the scheme expanded in the fourth quarter of this year, first covering self-employed persons such as sports coaches, music teachers and tutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the end of next year, the scope would expand to cover volunteers, and eventually at an unspecified date, all existing employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco security panel meeting, legislators said they supported the plan, saying it was necessary to better protect children and the mentally challenged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legal sector lawmaker Ambrose Lam asked whether the SAR would follow the UK system, known as the Sarah's Law, under which parents can seek records on a person who can come into contact with their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in Hong Kong, parents sometimes ask a friend to help pick up their children from school, and the SAR should be forward-thinking in preventing potential abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, security chief Chris Tang dismissed the idea, saying the two places are different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong this is too broad a scope. At the moment, friends would not be included under this [expanded] scope," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others expressed concern the expanded scheme would add more work for the police force, and that people who sought the checks would have to wait for a long time at police stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of lawmakers, including New People's Party's Dominic Lee, asked if officials could handle the applications electronically, such as using the government's iAM Smart mobile app.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Tang said the app cannot replace the stringent checks on the conviction records required, because it involves fingerprints of all fingers and thumbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials would conduct loading tests before the new system is up and running, which is capable of handling more than 210,000 new applications a year. Last year, there were around 83,000 ongoing requests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said six police stations planned to set up designated kiosks, allowing people to have their fingerprints collected throughout the day to help speed up the process.

    Exco backs three percent pay rises for civil servants

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a Civil Service Bureau proposal to give staff of all ranks a 3 percent pay rise this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The increases would be lower than the rises of up to 5.47 percent indicated by the recent Pay Trend Survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung said Exco considered various factors when agreeing to the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Executive Council has, in accordance with the mechanism governing the adjustment of civil service pay, considered six factors, namely the state of Hong Kong's economy, changes in the cost of living, the net pay trend indicators, the government's fiscal position, the pay claims of the staff side, as well as the civil service morale," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that this is a balanced decision, taking into account all those six factors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that while one in 10 civil service positions are vacant, salary is not the sole factor when it comes to retaining or attracting workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the pay rise proposal will be discussed with staff representatives on Wednesday before a final decision is reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, senior civil servants received a salary increase of 2.87 percent, while mid-ranking and junior staff had rises of 4.65 percent.

    Pair launch first civil action against JPEX
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two victims of alleged fraud cases involving the cryptocurrency trading company JPEX have lodged claims at the District Court to recover funds, in the first civil action against the platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The writ of summons, filed by plaintiffs Chan Wing-yan and Herbert Lee on Monday, listed JPEX Crypto Asset Platform as the first defendant, and locally-registered Web 3.0 Technical Support as the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three others, who appear as "holder of wallet address" for the three accounts on the trading platform, were also named as defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Chiu, a general manager of the over-the-counter cryptocurrency exchange Coingaroo, is listed as the sixth defendant. The pair are also suing "any persons who carried out or assisted in the scheme".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the plaintiffs, Chan, said she invested with JPEX after being led to believe that the platform was a licensed cryptocurrency exchange upon attending seminars and reading posts from social media influencer Lam Chok, according to the legal document.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also claimed that she paid and transferred a total of HK$1.85 million to Chiu, intending to purchase USDT, also known as Tether, between July and August in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair found assets of more than 247,400 USDT were transferred away "within five minutes after each of the deposits was being made" without authorisation, and subsequently moved to "many other wallets of unknown holders" before they looked into their accounts on September 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plaintiffs are seeking to recover the lost funds and are asking the court to grant an injunction to bar the defendants to deal with the assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Chu, a lawyer handling the pair's claims, pointed to the far-reaching impacts of the civil action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the criminal investigation into the perpetrators continues, victims should also pursue civil proceedings to recover their lost assets. This dual-track approach is crucial, as the police are unable to return any seized funds without a court order from the civil case," he said in a statement to RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Notably, the findings from the civil proceedings may potentially bolster the parallel criminal investigation against the suspects, underscoring the importance of this multifaceted legal strategy for the victims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng, for his part, described the case as a "milestone", and that he understood that more victims have considered taking civil action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On my end, around 10 people have plans to make claims. Of course, I believe there might also be people who have yet to contact us [wanting to take action]," Ng said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said overnight high-speed trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong from June 15, making transportation more convenient and cost-effective for passengers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Intercity passenger services, running at normal speed, used to carry travellers between Hung Hom and mainland cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but all services were suspended following the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said high-speed trains would be used to replace the normal-speed trains, and trains would run to and from West Kowloon Station instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the overnight trains would run from Friday to Monday, and would feature sleeping coaches for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are departures at night time, meaning that you board the train at night, and you arrive at your destination the next morning. Passengers spend the evening on the train, and there are also sleeping coaches, so after a night's sleep, you will arrive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very convenient, with a shortened journey time. You cut your travelling time by about 12 hours. You can also save on hotel accommodation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the journey time for overnight trains from West Kowloon Station to Shanghai and Beijing would be about 11 hours and 12.5 hours respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people would also be able to travel between Hong Kong and Hunan Province from June 15, with six new destinations including Zhangjiajie and Fenghuang Ancient Town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added there would be more short-haul train services as well.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has been urged to abandon the idea of increasing charges for water, with a community campaigner warning that some people can't afford to pay any more.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials note that Hong Kong's water charges haven't gone up for almost three decades and are much cheaper than in other advanced cities. They say any increases – to help plug a budget deficit – would be gradual and mild.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Sze Lai-shan from the Society for Community Organization told RTHK on Tuesday that low-income households would struggle to cover higher water bills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the authorities should consider waiving water charges altogether for people living in sub-divided flats, or provide them with a subsidy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung, a member of Legco's development panel, said the Water Supplies Department should consider implementing cost-cutting measures before increasing charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are some new technologies, equipment, and materials. They can also simplify work procedures and outsource some tasks. Implementing these measures can reduce costs," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now they're running out of money, and need more income. Shouldn't they explore these options before they do what some people have described as 'pulling a knife on them?' Wouldn't this approach result in greater acceptance from the public?"

    Law Society plans to reform lawyer disciplinary system

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CM Chan hopes the reforms can make disciplinary proceedings against lawyers more efficient. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756009_1_20240604111705.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing head of the Law Society, CM Chan, has said the body would soon announce a reform package on disciplinary proceedings for solicitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During his tenure as head of the regulator for solicitors, the society handled a number of high-profile complaints, with some still unfinished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes 16 cases the national security police referred to the body for alleged professional misconduct regarding the now-defunct 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund - which provided legal and other support for people arrested during the 2019 protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another unsettled probe is one against a law firm taken over by the society in 2020, after it was accused of violating solicitor accounting rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Ming Pao Daily newspaper published on Tuesday, Chan said the Law Society hasn't undertaken major reforms in decades and has to "move with the times and make improvements in many aspects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the aim is to improve efficiency and shorten the time needed for investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said while some people "find the wording and red lines of the national security laws to be vague", he thinks the public should read relevant judgments more to understand the reasoning and not just the verdicts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong is a co-host of the National Games next year and Chan told the Sing Tao Daily that the SAR could make use of this to develop sports arbitration and promote relevant legal work.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has warned that Hong Kong must remain on guard against attempts to endanger national security or disrupt public order.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said that a landmark subversion ruling handed down by a local court last week demonstrated that national security threats are very real.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen people were found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion by taking part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government. Another 31 people had earlier pleaded guilty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked how the authorities would deal with people marking June 4 in public, Lee said all activities must be conducted according to the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should not forget the pain that we all went through in the attempted colour revolution which took place in 2019," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acts which endanger national security can happen "all of a sudden", and perpetrators may use different excuses to disguise their intentions, he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law enforcement agencies will take action according to existing provisions, Lee stressed, including the Public Order Ordinance and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

    Education officials to look into HKU reshuffle: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education authorities are to look into reported infighting within the governing council of the University of Hong Kong after it reportedly approved changes to senior staff without consulting its president, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a report by the South China Morning Post, the university's president and vice-chancellor, Zhang Xiang, is seeking legal advice after being kept in the dark about the appointment of several interim vice-presidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes reportedly include a demotion for Richard Wong, Zhang’s right-hand man and deputy vice-chancellor, who has been serving as the university’s interim provost since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that Wong has been appointed as a vice-president and will oversee institutional advancement, while his original post will be taken up by Vivian Yam, a professor at the science faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee, who is chancellor of the university, was asked what will be done to protect the institution's reputation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "HKU is a successful university that belongs to the Hong Kong SAR. Hong Kong citizens and I myself, of course, have high expectations of good governance in HKU," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have tasked the Education Bureau to learn more about what is happening. They will report to me, and then I shall discuss with them about the way forward."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary has set June 25 to be the starting date for a mitigation hearing for Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hearing will start at 10am, and is expected to last for three days at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan last week passed judgement in the case, finding 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion, while acquitting two. Thirty-one others had earlier pleaded guilty to the same charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice had announced its intention to appeal against the acquittals.

    HK boosts hospitality to promote tourism

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Monday launched a campaign to promote good hospitality in the SAR and provide better services to visitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he hopes to make courtesy and good services a priority in all sectors after noting a few cases online of tourists being treated rudely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said authorities will produce training videos and recruit more people for the Hong Kong Pals Volunteer Programme – dedicated to sharing recommendations and tips with visitors – in hopes of making Hong Kong the best tourist destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most important thing is to make our tourists feel welcome. We can do that with a smile, or by asking a few questions or just making them feel cared for," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want their needs to be met. I'm confident that Hongkongers are hospitable by nature. We're polite. We need to do more to remind each other so that we can do better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrangements of the Waterbomb music festival, Yeung said he does not want an isolated incident to make people think that Hong Kong can't host events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People had to wait for hours in heavy rain after bad weather caused chaos at the K-pop and hip hop music festival over the weekend. Many fans were upset that they missed performances because of a storm signal, and were forced to wait for hours to retrieve their belongings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Organisers need to offer high-quality services so their customers feel they're spending their money well. With outdoor events, we always remind organisers to be cautious and to be prepared for extreme weather, which is quite common in Hong Kong from May to October. They need to consider what measures to take to deal with these contingencies," Yeung said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people in connection with the unlawful movement of a dead body outside a factory building in To Kwa Wan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they received a report on Sunday that a man was drunk, lying unconscious outside Merit Industrial Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unconscious man was sent to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deceased, 40, did not sustain any obvious injuries. An autopsy will be conducted to verify the cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing on Monday, chief inspector Law Chin-hon said the three suspects, aged 35 to 40, allegedly moved the body to the scene with a trolley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The four people had been hanging out in a unit at the factory building in which someone had alcoholic drinks. Later on, the deceased felt uncomfortable and became unconscious. The other three men used a trolley to move him to the place where the report was made and then fled the scene,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said all four people involved were mainland-Chinese and came to Hong Kong through two-way permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that one of the suspects was found to have overstayed their visa and was also arrested on breach of condition of stay.

    Collaboration needed to boost tourism and consumption

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Representatives from the catering, hotel and retail industry on Monday urged the government to implement new measures including AI-generated itineraries and "island-hopping" activities, as a means of boosting consumption and tourism given that many of sectors had not fully recovered from the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Eunice Yung said authorities should take advantage of the summer vacation period to attract tourists. She said a big data platform would allow sectors to better understand tourists' needs, adding that an "AI-tourism ambassador" would also personalise the vacation experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need a big data platform to keep all these mega events or what we can [do] to provide support for these mega events. We need an AI travel ambassador to promote and to give a good and accurate routine or travel itinerary for the tourists even if they want to stay for a longer time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said the government should consider dispersing mega events to different parts of the SAR so that more businesses can benefit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that authorities can also take advantage of Hong Kong waters for tourism activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can have some activities on those [outlying] islands, but if we can link up all these islands so that Hong Kong can be a hub for hopping to different islands. Each island can have different activities, but this is a long-term project and we have to put a lot of investment in that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't find any similar places in the world, which has so many islands, which we can use it as an aquatic hub for tourists and also for people in Hong Kong. If we are close to the sea, we have to think of something with the activities, which is related to the sea."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caspar Tsui, executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, hopes the government could get the sectors more involved with mega events in the SAR after the government announced an increase in these events from 150 to 210, adding that Hong Kong offers the "best package" for tourists with high-quality hotels, retail and restaurants.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National security police on Monday said they arrested one more person on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said seven people, including the former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were arrested last week in connection with seditious posts published on social media ahead of what officials described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow continues to be remanded at Tai Lam Centre for Women. The other six have been released on bail, with police accusing one of them of funding fugitive Nathan Law and other individuals through an online subscription platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's understood that a 62-year-old man arrested in Sha Tin on Monday is Chow's uncle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He's detained for further investigation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong's economy would continue to grow despite the challenges brought by geopolitical tensions and changes in consumption patterns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting on financial affairs, Chan said growth in employment income and a recovery in the stock market should help increase private spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho asked what would be done to help the struggling retail sector after sales dropped in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister said the government was in talks with central authorities for measures to boost the local economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are indeed looking into increasing the duty-free allowances for visitors returning to the mainland right now. The HK$5,000 figure has been in place for quite some time. We have been liaising with the central authorities on this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have recently included eight other cities in the individual visit scheme, and we will seek to expand the scheme even further. While we do understand that we should have more such policy support in place, we should be prudent in the effects or potential impact of these measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election committee lawmaker Tan Yueheng was concerned over whether there would be measures to reverse the trend of Hongkongers heading north to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may be hard to compete in terms of prices, but we can enhance the quality of services in Hong Kong. So how can we promote two-way consumption to enhance the contribution of consumption to GDP in Hong Kong?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Chan said the city should look for ways to improve product and tourist experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have our unique attractions. We never compete with others in terms of price. We compete with others in terms of the quality of services. We compete with others in terms of the quality of our goods and services and the experience we offer," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think various sectors, be it retail or catering, we all need to transform and enhance our competitiveness and increase the cost to value of their products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief noted that property prices have stabilised after the scrapping of all "spicy" property cooling measures, adding the SAR would think of ways to avoid getting caught up in the cross-hairs of Sino-US tensions.

    Govt says water bill rises would be 'gradual and mild'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of water supplies said the government plans to raise water bills in a gradual and mild manner, noting there was a need to make a timely adjustment as the charges have stayed the same for nearly three decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials have been reviewing the charges since the start of the year, as part of a wider study on the cost recovery of public services amid a budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Sing Tao Daily newspaper published on Monday, the Director of Water Supplies, Roger Wong, said besides recovering costs, the users' pay principle would also be a basis for the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the recovery rate of the water services operating accounts was at an historic low of 79 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water bills in Hong Kong, Wong added, made up around 0.1 to 0.2 percent of household expenditure, roughly a tenth of that in other advanced cities around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director stressed that people's affordability was a major consideration, but he didn't say when an adjustment might be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Laundry Association chairman, Chau Hon-keung, said on RTHK that he thinks now is not the time to add to people's burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said if charges are raised, the costs would surely be passed on to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have told the director [in a meeting] that if you haven't raised charges for so long, it's fair enough to increase them. But we don't think it's good timing, because everybody is finding things tough at the moment," Chau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's no other way, then do it softly. Don't raise it by double digits as some organisations have done in the past...we hope the increase will be about five percent - rather than close to 10 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said on the same programme that any minor increase would add tremendous pressure on the catering sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although water bills are not a big part of our operating costs, we are really worried [an increase] would lead to a chain reaction, such as raises in power bills, management fees and others that cause inflation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said as some Hongkongers had been making trips north of the border for retail and dining, he thinks caterers wouldn't dare hike their prices if water bills went up.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Monday urged the government to set up an interdepartmental group to formulate a strategy to ensure it keeps up with the growing use of low-altitude flying technology.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan Siu-hung is among a group of lawmakers who want the government to lead projects in the SAR, such as using drones for food and medicine delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said mainland officials support this sector's development, and local authorities in the SAR should do the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said other cities in the Greater Bay Area - such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Zhuhai - were planning to build air transport networks using drones for logistics and transport services and to transport passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Hong Kong cannot afford to lag behind," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said unmanned aircraft had been flying successfully on the mainland for several years with stable operations, "but Hong Kong has yet to make significant progress in this area".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the technology, supply chain and ecosystems for these activities were already mature on the mainland "so I think the (SAR) government should promptly establish an interdepartmental working group on the low-altitude economy to formulate comprehensive strategies for the development of this fast-growing sector".

<div class="itemFullText">
 An engineer says routine check-ups and reports of uneven road surface from the public could help reduce the incidence of road subsidence in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Aaron Bok, former president of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, was speaking after traffic authorities partially reopened a stretch of road in Sham Shui Po last night after an eight by 12 metre hole opened up on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A section of Hai Tan Street was cordoned off after part of the carriageway plunged into a four-metre-deep hole that measured about eight by 12 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Sunday evening, the fast lane of Hai Tan Street, between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street, was reopened following temporary repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bok, who previously worked for the Water Supplies Department, warned that the SAR had thousands of kilometres of pipes that needed to be checked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such incidents tended to be caused by construction activity or deep excavation or by damage to underground pipes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Sham Shui Po incident was probably caused by damage to nearby piping, and said regular surveys are needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bok proposed that remote cameras could be used every two or three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If during the survey they find there are some cracks or damage in the pipes, seal these holes immediately. That can prevent these small cavities from increasing," Bok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said permanent repair works would be carried out on the slow lane, which is expected to reopen to traffic before Wednesday’s rush hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials would then begin permanent repairs for the fast lane that would be completed on June 7.

 Authorities have partially reopened a stretch of road in Sham Shui Po that was hit by heavy subsidence, earlier than expected.

  Late on Sunday evening, the fast lane of Hai Tan Street, between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street, was reopened following temporary repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Vehicles are still prohibited from making a left turn from Kweilin Street into Hai Tan Street. Affected bus routes have resumed their original routeings," the Transport Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities had earlier expected to complete repairs by midnight and reopen the lane before 6 am on Monday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Sunday said it is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic passenger flights by the first quarter of 2025, having reached 80 percent of capacity within the second quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's flagship airline, which suffered heavy losses and layoffs during the pandemic, had aimed to reach 100 percent capacity by the end of 2024, but in March moved the target back three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay reported its first annual profit in four years in March, however executives said they expect yields to normalise this year as the post-pandemic global imbalance between supply of flights and travel demand that drove up ticket prices and airline yields diminishes as airlines add capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed we're seeing that this year ... the yield has been normalising gradually coming down from last year. In particular, the supply and demand balancing is going quicker on the regional, the short haul routes,"  Cathay CEO Ronald Lam told reporters during an airline conference in Dubai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier also restored capacity more slowly after the pandemic than its closest rival, Singapore Airlines, because it faced tighter quarantine rules for longer, and needed to hire more staff to bring back services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said Cathay's plan to expand its workforce by around 20 percent, or 5,000 people, this year was also on track. (Reuters)

    Govt mulls per-building waste charging: Tse Chin-wan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister, Tse Chin-wan, on Sunday said authorities will look into a different way of charging people for the waste they throw away, based on the total volume of garbage generated in each building.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the administration again suspended a pay-as-you-throw scheme, under which people would have had to buy designated bags for their waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on TVB, Tse rejected the idea that structuring the scheme this way would be less effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people may think it's not enough as an incentive if we impose waste charging per building, but it has to do with the culture as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we can nurture a culture that supports waste reduction, people will think those who are not willing to do it are irresponsible, and the owners' committees will look into how to reduce waste expenses and call on residents to recycle more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Tse said officials are planning to extend the opening hours of all government recycling stations by three hours from next month at the earliest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said they are looking at the possibility of allowing residents to use the points they have accrued from recycling to redeem shopping vouchers that can be used at supermarkets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that he hopes the recycling rate, which stood at 32 percent in 2022, can go up further in a short period of time.

    Hai Tan Street to partially reopen on Monday

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Sunday said it aims to partially reopen on Monday a stretch of road in Sham Shui Po that was hit by heavy subsidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials had cordoned off a section of Hai Tan Street after part of the carriageway plunged into a four-metre-deep hole that measured about eight by 12 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Water Supplies Department earlier noted that there was no damage to a water main but a sewer and a storm drain two metres down have been affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The water supply is fine, but we found that there's partial damage to the drain pipes. Mainly it's water and soil loss after heavy rains in recent days," said Roger Wong, the department's director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now we are trying to fix the issues to ensure the safety of all residents," he added, noting that an investigation into the cause of the subsidence is under way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People in the area on Sunday said the closure of the stretch of road between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street was not too inconvenient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I mean, of course there's some impact as I need to take a bus to come back, so I am getting off [at a nearby station], but it's just one block away, so it's still okay," one pedestrian on his way to yum cha told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a taxi driver said he might need to circle around to find alternative routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually I drive straight ahead on this road, and I use this path very frequently.  Now I have to maybe take another two or three minutes when using another route," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scott Leung, a lawmaker representing the Kowloon West constituency, urged authorities to find the cause of the incident and step up work to survey underground pipes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Can we ramp up the surveying of drainage pipes and water pipes in future, so that subsidences won't occur because things can get out of order underground without people noticing," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Water Supplies Department already has plans to inspect and repair water pipes in old areas, but other departments also need to do this for other pipes,” he added.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said his administration will promote further cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland city of Tianjin for win-win outcomes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He delivered a speech via video link to a conference of entrepreneurs from the two cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said Hong Kong is the biggest source of foreign investment for Tianjin, and the SAR’s super connector status, has enabled enterprises in Tianjin to establish their business overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong brings together international capital and first-class financial talents, has abundant financing channels and a legal system that is in line with international standards," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government will continue to leverage Hong Kong's role as a 'super connector' and 'super value adder' to promote in-depth cooperation between Hong Kong and Tianjin for mutual benefit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also noted that the SAR administration and Tianjin signed a memorandum of understanding in April to promote aircraft leasing and financing industries, saying it brings opportunities and impetus to the aviation and financial industries in the two cities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A stretch of Hai Tan Street in Sham Shui Po has been closed for a week, after dramatically subsiding on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos from the scene show that a three by four metre patch of the road collapsed into the ground, to a depth of about three metres. A one-block stretch of the road will be out of use until Friday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at about 4pm on Friday about the subsidence. Officers cordoned off the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the authorities would have to carry out work on an underground water main at the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said on Saturday that all lanes of Hai Tan Street between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street would be closed to all traffic until 6am next Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said affected bus routes have been diverted.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory cancelled all storm signals at 5.40pm on Saturday as storm Maliksi weakened and moved further from the territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said storm Maliksi was moving across Qingyuan in Guangdong and would gradually move away from Hong Kong. It had downgraded the Strong Wind Signal Number 3 to the Standby Signal Number 1 an hour earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maliksi or its remnant is expected to bring more showers with occasional squalls to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary tonight and tomorrow morning," the Observatory said. "Members of the public should stay on the alert."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With seas expected to be rough with swells, people are being advised to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.

    Homegrown C919 aircraft makes return to HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's first homegrown passenger aircraft made its return to Hong Kong on Saturday to fly more than 100 university students for a visit to Shanghai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The C919 made its debut in the SAR in December, delighting spectators with a spectacular flypast over Victoria Harbour. This time it's serving a charter flight for participants in a youth internship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony at the airport, Chief Secretary Eric Chan welcomed the aircraft's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The C919 returns to Hong Kong today, taking young people in Hong Kong to Shanghai to experience life at a mainland airport," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, they will experience national affairs and development at first hand.I believe this experience will be unforgettable for all the students and will be useful for their lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students onboard the flight told RTHK that they were excited to learn more about the aviation industry on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to have this opportunity to take the first C919 flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Through this opportunity, I can learn more about the homegrown aircraft industry on the mainland," said one student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she hoped the seats would be comfy and wondered whether meals would be served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is my first time to take the domestically-made plane. I'm interested to know whether the facilities on the plane will be different than those from other countries," said another student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Andrew Yao who chairs the Federation of Hong Kong-Shanghai Associations, said he hopes students can learn more about the development of the Belt and Road initiative through the internship programme.

    Working together will reduce waste in GBA: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said a proposal to integrate waste management across the Greater Bay Area does not simply mean Hong Kong will send its rubbish for disposal across the border.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister confirmed that the authorities are mulling working with mainland counterparts on handling and recycling waste to achieve carbon neutrality and build a waste-free bay area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tse said the plan is not to ship waste to the rest of the Greater Bay Area for incineration, but to recycle and reuse it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To achieve carbon neutrality, many countries have been promoting resource circulation. This concept is not difficult to understand. It simply means turning resources into products, such as the clothes you are wearing or the chair you are sitting on. It's not sustainable if all these products end up turning into garbage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added he is confident that Hong Kong will be able to deal with a daily average of around 11,000 tonnes of garbage after the territory's three incinerators are put into operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waste integration proposal came after the SAR announced on Monday that it was shelving a territory-wide waste charging scheme for a third time. The minister reiterated that the move does not mean the government is pausing its waste reduction efforts.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Friday said it strongly disapproved and condemned the US Department of State for proposing visa restriction on Beijing and SAR officials responsible for implementing the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Washington said on Friday that it was taking steps to put the visa restrictions in place after the trial under the NSL of 47 people on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion. It gave no further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the defendants were acquitted and fourteen were found guilty, with the remainder pleading guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a spokesman for the SAR government said: “The proposed imposition of the so-called 'visa restrictions' by the US Government smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate PRC and HKSAR officials who resolutely safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong's affairs, and violate the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR despises such threat and will not be intimidated by such a despicable behaviour.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement added that the SAR would continue to do its duty in safeguarding national security, adding that the findings of the judges in the case on Wednesday “clearly confirmed that the criminal acts in the case aimed at undermining, destroying or overthrowing the existing political system and structure of the HKSAR established under the Basic Law and the 'one country, two systems' principle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such criminal acts endangering national security had nothing to do with the so-called fight for democracy and human rights,” the statement added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrics expert on Saturday said there's been no easing of the winter flu outbreak in Hong Kong, and he expects the situation to continue for several more weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Hong Kong said the number of influenza cases would usually fall off in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The condition of the influenza outbreak [had] been persistent throughout May, and we are expecting actually even in June, there will still be a few more weeks of influenza outbreak affecting many of our young children," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, we find most of those severe influenza cases, including the death cases, occur more dominantly in young children, particularly with those without any influenza vaccination."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged parents to get their children vaccinated. Four children have died of flu so far this year.

    National security not a concern for US businesses: FS

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Friday that businesses he met on a visit to California only wanted to talk about the business environment in Hong Kong and did not raise national security matters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan made a visit to San Francisco, together with delegations from Guangdong Province and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong and partners in San Francisco signed three memorandums of understanding on developing carbon markets, sustainable finance, investment promotion and the nurturing of talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief said businesses in the United States were "curious" and "interested" in the opportunities available in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The business proposition we put to the business sector here is that the Greater Bay Area as a market is of huge size: 87 million people. This is one of the most affluent, most dynamic, economically very high vitality areas," he told reporters in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Presenting tremendous opportunities for the business sector here, no matter if it is for consumer market or for extending the service or solutions onto the mainland, the exchanges that we have with them proved this proposition to be quite attractive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding national security, Chan said businesses in the United States had other concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No question has ever been raised in this respect... In fact, the concern and the interest of the business sector here is the stability of Hong Kong, the overall business environment, the impact of high interest rates on Hong Kong, and also the performance of stock market, the property market, as well as foreign business interest and investment in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan was due to arrive back in the SAR on Saturday morning.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sun Dong, pictured with host Eugene Chan, said that Hong Kong has the advantages to become an international I&T centre. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755668_1_20240601090134.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong says the innovation and technology sector in Hong Kong has made a lot of progress in the past few years with the I&T ecosystem becoming more vibrant than before, adding that the SAR serves as a super value adder to foster global collaboration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said that the SAR has the advantages to becoming an international I&T centre with its top institutions, experts and scholars, a mature intellectual property rights protection system, a robust rule of law and a good business environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past few years, the Hong Kong government has invested more than HK$210 billion to enhance technological research infrastructure, subsidise R&D activities, support collaboration among industry, academic and research sectors, as well as put together nurtured technology talents," he told RTHK's Your Home Address programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that the SAR has rolled out a number of policies to attract, retain and nurture talents, including the Technology Talent Admission Scheme, meant for admitting technology talents to conduct R&D work in Hong Kong, the STEM Internship Scheme for university students to gain experience in the field and the New Industrialisation and Technology Training Programme to subsidise training for staff in local companies on advanced technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I put together local and non-local researchers to conduct world-class and impactful scientific research. For this InnoHK research clusters, this is a very successful programme aiming to promote the global research collaboration. So far, we have established 29 InnoHK research centres in Hong Kong Science Park in collaboration with more than 30 top-notch universities and research institutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the two clusters, one is life and health technology and the other one is robotics and AI. To further expand this successful programme, we are going to build a third cluster focused on advanced manufacturing, sustainable development, new energy and material as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the recently launched Research Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) has been very successful in supporting hundreds of university research teams to transfer their research outcomes into real applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said that authorities would accelerate digital economy development to build Hong Kong into a smart city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The Digital Policy Office] will be responsible for formulating policies on digital government, data governance and information technology, promoting the opening up of data and offering more digital services. This office will be in charge of introducing more digital government initiative for convenience and benefit of the public and business sector," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we plan to launch over 100 digital government smart city initiatives including providing the digital payments for all government services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the office would also work closely with the Guangdong province to promote cross-boundary public services initiative in both areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun believes that Hong Kong can put together the innovation resources from the GBA and the world to promote development and investment, making the territory the best springboard for overseas markets to venture into the GBA, the mainland and the Asian market.
