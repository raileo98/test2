<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two victims of alleged fraud cases involving the cryptocurrency trading company JPEX have lodged claims at the District Court to recover funds, in the first civil action against the platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The writ of summons, filed by plaintiffs Chan Wing-yan and Herbert Lee on Monday, listed JPEX Crypto Asset Platform as the first defendant, and locally-registered Web 3.0 Technical Support as the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three others, who appear as "holder of wallet address" for the three accounts on the trading platform, were also named as defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Chiu, a general manager of the over-the-counter cryptocurrency exchange Coingaroo, is listed as the sixth defendant. The pair are also suing "any persons who carried out or assisted in the scheme".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the plaintiffs, Chan, said she invested with JPEX after being led to believe that the platform was a licensed cryptocurrency exchange upon attending seminars and reading posts from social media influencer Lam Chok, according to the legal document.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also claimed that she paid and transferred a total of HK$1.85 million to Chiu, intending to purchase USDT, also known as Tether, between July and August in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair found assets of more than 247,400 USDT were transferred away "within five minutes after each of the deposits was being made" without authorisation, and subsequently moved to "many other wallets of unknown holders" before they looked into their accounts on September 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plaintiffs are seeking to recover the lost funds and are asking the court to grant an injunction to bar the defendants to deal with the assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Chu, a lawyer handling the pair's claims, pointed to the far-reaching impacts of the civil action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the criminal investigation into the perpetrators continues, victims should also pursue civil proceedings to recover their lost assets. This dual-track approach is crucial, as the police are unable to return any seized funds without a court order from the civil case," he said in a statement to RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Notably, the findings from the civil proceedings may potentially bolster the parallel criminal investigation against the suspects, underscoring the importance of this multifaceted legal strategy for the victims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng, for his part, described the case as a "milestone", and that he understood that more victims have considered taking civil action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On my end, around 10 people have plans to make claims. Of course, I believe there might also be people who have yet to contact us [wanting to take action]," Ng said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said overnight high-speed trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong from June 15, making transportation more convenient and cost-effective for passengers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Intercity passenger services, running at normal speed, used to carry travellers between Hung Hom and mainland cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but all services were suspended following the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said high-speed trains would be used to replace the normal-speed trains, and trains would run to and from West Kowloon Station instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the overnight trains would run from Friday to Monday, and would feature sleeping coaches for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are departures at night time, meaning that you board the train at night, and you arrive at your destination the next morning. Passengers spend the evening on the train, and there are also sleeping coaches, so after a night's sleep, you will arrive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very convenient, with a shortened journey time. You cut your travelling time by about 12 hours. You can also save on hotel accommodation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the journey time for overnight trains from West Kowloon Station to Shanghai and Beijing would be about 11 hours and 12.5 hours respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people would also be able to travel between Hong Kong and Hunan Province from June 15, with six new destinations including Zhangjiajie and Fenghuang Ancient Town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added there would be more short-haul train services as well.

    Govt urged not to increase water charges

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Officials note that Hong Kong's water charges haven't gone up for almost three decades. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756013_1_20240604120117.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has been urged to abandon the idea of increasing charges for water, with a community campaigner warning that some people can't afford to pay any more.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials note that Hong Kong's water charges haven't gone up for almost three decades and are much cheaper than in other advanced cities. They say any increases – to help plug a budget deficit – would be gradual and mild.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Sze Lai-shan from the Society for Community Organization told RTHK on Tuesday that low-income households would struggle to cover higher water bills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the authorities should consider waiving water charges altogether for people living in sub-divided flats, or provide them with a subsidy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung, a member of Legco's development panel, said the Water Supplies Department should consider implementing cost-cutting measures before increasing charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are some new technologies, equipment, and materials. They can also simplify work procedures and outsource some tasks. Implementing these measures can reduce costs," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now they're running out of money, and need more income. Shouldn't they explore these options before they do what some people have described as 'pulling a knife on them?' Wouldn't this approach result in greater acceptance from the public?"

    Law Society plans to reform lawyer disciplinary system

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CM Chan hopes the reforms can make disciplinary proceedings against lawyers more efficient. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756009_1_20240604111705.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing head of the Law Society, CM Chan, has said the body would soon announce a reform package on disciplinary proceedings for solicitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During his tenure as head of the regulator for solicitors, the society handled a number of high-profile complaints, with some still unfinished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes 16 cases the national security police referred to the body for alleged professional misconduct regarding the now-defunct 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund - which provided legal and other support for people arrested during the 2019 protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another unsettled probe is one against a law firm taken over by the society in 2020, after it was accused of violating solicitor accounting rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Ming Pao Daily newspaper published on Tuesday, Chan said the Law Society hasn't undertaken major reforms in decades and has to "move with the times and make improvements in many aspects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the aim is to improve efficiency and shorten the time needed for investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said while some people "find the wording and red lines of the national security laws to be vague", he thinks the public should read relevant judgments more to understand the reasoning and not just the verdicts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong is a co-host of the National Games next year and Chan told the Sing Tao Daily that the SAR could make use of this to develop sports arbitration and promote relevant legal work.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has warned that Hong Kong must remain on guard against attempts to endanger national security or disrupt public order.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said that a landmark subversion ruling handed down by a local court last week demonstrated that national security threats are very real.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen people were found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion by taking part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government. Another 31 people had earlier pleaded guilty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked how the authorities would deal with people marking June 4 in public, Lee said all activities must be conducted according to the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should not forget the pain that we all went through in the attempted colour revolution which took place in 2019," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acts which endanger national security can happen "all of a sudden", and perpetrators may use different excuses to disguise their intentions, he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law enforcement agencies will take action according to existing provisions, Lee stressed, including the Public Order Ordinance and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.

    Education officials to look into HKU reshuffle: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education authorities are to look into reported infighting within the governing council of the University of Hong Kong after it reportedly approved changes to senior staff without consulting its president, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a SCMP report, the university's president and vice-chancellor, Zhang Xiang, is seeking legal advice after being kept in the dark about the appointment of several interim vice-presidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes reportedly include a demotion for Richard Wong, Zhang’s right-hand man and deputy vice-chancellor, who has been serving as the university’s interim provost since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that Wong has been appointed as a vice-president and will oversee institutional advancement, while his original post will be taken up by Vivian Yam, a professor at the science faculty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee, who is chancellor of the university, was asked what will be done to protect the institution's reputation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "HKU is a successful university that belongs to the Hong Kong SAR. Hong Kong citizens and I myself, of course, have high expectations of good governance in HKU," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have tasked the Education Bureau to learn more about what is happening. They will report to me, and then I shall discuss with them about the way forward."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary has set June 25 to be the starting date for a mitigation hearing for Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hearing will start at 10am, and is expected to last for three days at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan last week passed judgement in the case, finding 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion, while acquitting two. Thirty-one others had earlier pleaded guilty to the same charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice had announced its intention to appeal against the acquittals.

    HK boosts hospitality to promote tourism

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755935_1_20240603182037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Monday launched a campaign to promote good hospitality in the SAR and provide better services to visitors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he hopes to make courtesy and good services a priority in all sectors after noting a few cases online of tourists being treated rudely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said authorities will produce training videos and recruit more people for the Hong Kong Pals Volunteer Programme – dedicated to sharing recommendations and tips with visitors – in hopes of making Hong Kong the best tourist destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most important thing is to make our tourists feel welcome. We can do that with a smile, or by asking a few questions or just making them feel cared for," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want their needs to be met. I'm confident that Hongkongers are hospitable by nature. We're polite. We need to do more to remind each other so that we can do better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrangements of the Waterbomb music festival, Yeung said he does not want an isolated incident to make people think that Hong Kong can't host events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People had to wait for hours in heavy rain after bad weather caused chaos at the K-pop and hip hop music festival over the weekend. Many fans were upset that they missed performances because of a storm signal, and were forced to wait for hours to retrieve their belongings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Organisers need to offer high-quality services so their customers feel they're spending their money well. With outdoor events, we always remind organisers to be cautious and to be prepared for extreme weather, which is quite common in Hong Kong from May to October. They need to consider what measures to take to deal with these contingencies," Yeung said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people in connection with the unlawful movement of a dead body outside a factory building in To Kwa Wan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they received a report on Sunday that a man was drunk, lying unconscious outside Merit Industrial Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unconscious man was sent to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deceased, 40, did not sustain any obvious injuries. An autopsy will be conducted to verify the cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing on Monday, chief inspector Law Chin-hon said the three suspects, aged 35 to 40, allegedly moved the body to the scene with a trolley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The four people had been hanging out in a unit at the factory building in which someone had alcoholic drinks. Later on, the deceased felt uncomfortable and became unconscious. The other three men used a trolley to move him to the place where the report was made and then fled the scene,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said all four people involved were mainland-Chinese and came to Hong Kong through two-way permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that one of the suspects was found to have overstayed their visa and was also arrested on breach of condition of stay.

    Collaboration needed to boost tourism and consumption

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Representatives from the catering, hotel and retail industry on Monday urged the government to implement new measures including AI-generated itineraries and "island-hopping" activities, as a means of boosting consumption and tourism given that many of sectors had not fully recovered from the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Eunice Yung said authorities should take advantage of the summer vacation period to attract tourists. She said a big data platform would allow sectors to better understand tourists' needs, adding that an "AI-tourism ambassador" would also personalise the vacation experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need a big data platform to keep all these mega events or what we can [do] to provide support for these mega events. We need an AI travel ambassador to promote and to give a good and accurate routine or travel itinerary for the tourists even if they want to stay for a longer time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said the government should consider dispersing mega events to different parts of the SAR so that more businesses can benefit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that authorities can also take advantage of Hong Kong waters for tourism activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can have some activities on those [outlying] islands, but if we can link up all these islands so that Hong Kong can be a hub for hopping to different islands. Each island can have different activities, but this is a long-term project and we have to put a lot of investment in that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't find any similar places in the world, which has so many islands, which we can use it as an aquatic hub for tourists and also for people in Hong Kong. If we are close to the sea, we have to think of something with the activities, which is related to the sea."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caspar Tsui, executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, hopes the government could get the sectors more involved with mega events in the SAR after the government announced an increase in these events from 150 to 210, adding that Hong Kong offers the "best package" for tourists with high-quality hotels, retail and restaurants.

 National security police on Monday said they arrested one more person on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said seven people, including the former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were arrested last week in connection with seditious posts published on social media ahead of what officials described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow continues to be remanded at Tai Lam Centre for Women. The other six have been released on bail, with police accusing one of them of funding fugitive Nathan Law and other individuals through an online subscription platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's understood that a 62-year-old man arrested in Sha Tin on Monday is Chow's uncle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He's detained for further investigation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong's economy would continue to grow despite the challenges brought by geopolitical tensions and changes in consumption patterns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting on financial affairs, Chan said growth in employment income and a recovery in the stock market should help increase private spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho asked what would be done to help the struggling retail sector after sales dropped in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister said the government was in talks with central authorities for measures to boost the local economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are indeed looking into increasing the duty-free allowances for visitors returning to the mainland right now. The HK$5,000 figure has been in place for quite some time. We have been liaising with the central authorities on this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have recently included eight other cities in the individual visit scheme, and we will seek to expand the scheme even further. While we do understand that we should have more such policy support in place, we should be prudent in the effects or potential impact of these measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election committee lawmaker Tan Yueheng was concerned over whether there would be measures to reverse the trend of Hongkongers heading north to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may be hard to compete in terms of prices, but we can enhance the quality of services in Hong Kong. So how can we promote two-way consumption to enhance the contribution of consumption to GDP in Hong Kong?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Chan said the city should look for ways to improve product and tourist experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have our unique attractions. We never compete with others in terms of price. We compete with others in terms of the quality of services. We compete with others in terms of the quality of our goods and services and the experience we offer," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think various sectors, be it retail or catering, we all need to transform and enhance our competitiveness and increase the cost to value of their products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief noted that property prices have stabilised after the scrapping of all "spicy" property cooling measures, adding the SAR would think of ways to avoid getting caught up in the cross-hairs of Sino-US tensions.

    Govt says water bill rises would be 'gradual and mild'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of water supplies said the government plans to raise water bills in a gradual and mild manner, noting there was a need to make a timely adjustment as the charges have stayed the same for nearly three decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials have been reviewing the charges since the start of the year, as part of a wider study on the cost recovery of public services amid a budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Sing Tao Daily newspaper published on Monday, the Director of Water Supplies, Roger Wong, said besides recovering costs, the users' pay principle would also be a basis for the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the recovery rate of the water services operating accounts was at an historic low of 79 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water bills in Hong Kong, Wong added, made up around 0.1 to 0.2 percent of household expenditure, roughly a tenth of that in other advanced cities around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director stressed that people's affordability was a major consideration, but he didn't say when an adjustment might be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Laundry Association chairman, Chau Hon-keung, said on RTHK that he thinks now is not the time to add to people's burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said if charges are raised, the costs would surely be passed on to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have told the director [in a meeting] that if you haven't raised charges for so long, it's fair enough to increase them. But we don't think it's good timing, because everybody is finding things tough at the moment," Chau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's no other way, then do it softly. Don't raise it by double digits as some organisations have done in the past...we hope the increase will be about five percent - rather than close to 10 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said on the same programme that any minor increase would add tremendous pressure on the catering sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although water bills are not a big part of our operating costs, we are really worried [an increase] would lead to a chain reaction, such as raises in power bills, management fees and others that cause inflation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said as some Hongkongers had been making trips north of the border for retail and dining, he thinks caterers wouldn't dare hike their prices if water bills went up.

 A lawmaker on Monday urged the government to set up an interdepartmental group to formulate a strategy to ensure it keeps up with the growing use of low-altitude flying technology.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan Siu-hung is among a group of lawmakers who want the government to lead projects in the SAR, such as using drones for food and medicine delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said mainland officials support this sector's development, and local authorities in the SAR should do the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said other cities in the Greater Bay Area - such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Zhuhai - were planning to build air transport networks using drones for logistics and transport services and to transport passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Hong Kong cannot afford to lag behind," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said unmanned aircraft had been flying successfully on the mainland for several years with stable operations, "but Hong Kong has yet to make significant progress in this area".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the technology, supply chain and ecosystems for these activities were already mature on the mainland "so I think the (SAR) government should promptly establish an interdepartmental working group on the low-altitude economy to formulate comprehensive strategies for the development of this fast-growing sector".

<div class="itemFullText">
 An engineer says routine check-ups and reports of uneven road surface from the public could help reduce the incidence of road subsidence in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Aaron Bok, former president of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, was speaking after traffic authorities partially reopened a stretch of road in Sham Shui Po last night after an eight by 12 metre hole opened up on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A section of Hai Tan Street was cordoned off after part of the carriageway plunged into a four-metre-deep hole that measured about eight by 12 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Sunday evening, the fast lane of Hai Tan Street, between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street, was reopened following temporary repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bok, who previously worked for the Water Supplies Department, warned that the SAR had thousands of kilometres of pipes that needed to be checked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such incidents tended to be caused by construction activity or deep excavation or by damage to underground pipes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Sham Shui Po incident was probably caused by damage to nearby piping, and said regular surveys are needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bok proposed that remote cameras could be used every two or three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If during the survey they find there are some cracks or damage in the pipes, seal these holes immediately. That can prevent these small cavities from increasing," Bok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said permanent repair works would be carried out on the slow lane, which is expected to reopen to traffic before Wednesday’s rush hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials would then begin permanent repairs for the fast lane that would be completed on June 7.

 Authorities have partially reopened a stretch of road in Sham Shui Po that was hit by heavy subsidence, earlier than expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A section of Hai Tan Street was cordoned off after part of the carriageway plunged into a four-metre-deep hole that measured about eight by 12 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Sunday evening, the fast lane of Hai Tan Street, between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street, was reopened following temporary repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Vehicles are still prohibited from making a left turn from Kweilin Street into Hai Tan Street. Affected bus routes have resumed their original routeings," the Transport Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities had earlier expected to complete repairs by midnight and reopen the lane before 6 am on Monday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Sunday said it is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic passenger flights by the first quarter of 2025, having reached 80 percent of capacity within the second quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's flagship airline, which suffered heavy losses and layoffs during the pandemic, had aimed to reach 100 percent capacity by the end of 2024, but in March moved the target back three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay reported its first annual profit in four years in March, however executives said they expect yields to normalise this year as the post-pandemic global imbalance between supply of flights and travel demand that drove up ticket prices and airline yields diminishes as airlines add capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed we're seeing that this year ... the yield has been normalising gradually coming down from last year. In particular, the supply and demand balancing is going quicker on the regional, the short haul routes,"  Cathay CEO Ronald Lam told reporters during an airline conference in Dubai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier also restored capacity more slowly after the pandemic than its closest rival, Singapore Airlines, because it faced tighter quarantine rules for longer, and needed to hire more staff to bring back services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said Cathay's plan to expand its workforce by around 20 percent, or 5,000 people, this year was also on track. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister, Tse Chin-wan, on Sunday said authorities will look into a different way of charging people for the waste they throw away, based on the total volume of garbage generated in each building.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the administration again suspended a pay-as-you-throw scheme, under which people would have had to buy designated bags for their waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on TVB, Tse rejected the idea that structuring the scheme this way would be less effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people may think it's not enough as an incentive if we impose waste charging per building, but it has to do with the culture as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we can nurture a culture that supports waste reduction, people will think those who are not willing to do it are irresponsible, and the owners' committees will look into how to reduce waste expenses and call on residents to recycle more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Tse said officials are planning to extend the opening hours of all government recycling stations by three hours from next month at the earliest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said they are looking at the possibility of allowing residents to use the points they have accrued from recycling to redeem shopping vouchers that can be used at supermarkets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that he hopes the recycling rate, which stood at 32 percent in 2022, can go up further in a short period of time.

    Hai Tan Street to partially reopen on Monday

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Sunday said it aims to partially reopen on Monday a stretch of road in Sham Shui Po that was hit by heavy subsidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials had cordoned off a section of Hai Tan Street after part of the carriageway plunged into a four-metre-deep hole that measured about eight by 12 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Water Supplies Department earlier noted that there was no damage to a water main but a sewer and a storm drain two metres down have been affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The water supply is fine, but we found that there's partial damage to the drain pipes. Mainly it's water and soil loss after heavy rains in recent days," said Roger Wong, the department's director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now we are trying to fix the issues to ensure the safety of all residents," he added, noting that an investigation into the cause of the subsidence is under way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People in the area on Sunday said the closure of the stretch of road between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street was not too inconvenient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I mean, of course there's some impact as I need to take a bus to come back, so I am getting off [at a nearby station], but it's just one block away, so it's still okay," one pedestrian on his way to yum cha told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a taxi driver said he might need to circle around to find alternative routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually I drive straight ahead on this road, and I use this path very frequently.  Now I have to maybe take another two or three minutes when using another route," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scott Leung, a lawmaker representing the Kowloon West constituency, urged authorities to find the cause of the incident and step up work to survey underground pipes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Can we ramp up the surveying of drainage pipes and water pipes in future, so that subsidences won't occur because things can get out of order underground without people noticing," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Water Supplies Department already has plans to inspect and repair water pipes in old areas, but other departments also need to do this for other pipes,” he added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said his administration will promote further cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland city of Tianjin for win-win outcomes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He delivered a speech via video link to a conference of entrepreneurs from the two cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said Hong Kong is the biggest source of foreign investment for Tianjin, and the SAR’s super connector status, has enabled enterprises in Tianjin to establish their business overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong brings together international capital and first-class financial talents, has abundant financing channels and a legal system that is in line with international standards," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government will continue to leverage Hong Kong's role as a 'super connector' and 'super value adder' to promote in-depth cooperation between Hong Kong and Tianjin for mutual benefit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also noted that the SAR administration and Tianjin signed a memorandum of understanding in April to promote aircraft leasing and financing industries, saying it brings opportunities and impetus to the aviation and financial industries in the two cities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A stretch of Hai Tan Street in Sham Shui Po has been closed for a week, after dramatically subsiding on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos from the scene show that a three by four metre patch of the road collapsed into the ground, to a depth of about three metres. A one-block stretch of the road will be out of use until Friday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at about 4pm on Friday about the subsidence. Officers cordoned off the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the authorities would have to carry out work on an underground water main at the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said on Saturday that all lanes of Hai Tan Street between Yen Chow Street and Kweilin Street would be closed to all traffic until 6am next Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said affected bus routes have been diverted.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory cancelled all storm signals at 5.40pm on Saturday as storm Maliksi weakened and moved further from the territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said storm Maliksi was moving across Qingyuan in Guangdong and would gradually move away from Hong Kong. It had downgraded the Strong Wind Signal Number 3 to the Standby Signal Number 1 an hour earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maliksi or its remnant is expected to bring more showers with occasional squalls to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary tonight and tomorrow morning," the Observatory said. "Members of the public should stay on the alert."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With seas expected to be rough with swells, people are being advised to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.

    Homegrown C919 aircraft makes return to HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's first homegrown passenger aircraft made its return to Hong Kong on Saturday to fly more than 100 university students for a visit to Shanghai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The C919 made its debut in the SAR in December, delighting spectators with a spectacular flypast over Victoria Harbour. This time it's serving a charter flight for participants in a youth internship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony at the airport, Chief Secretary Eric Chan welcomed the aircraft's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The C919 returns to Hong Kong today, taking young people in Hong Kong to Shanghai to experience life at a mainland airport," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, they will experience national affairs and development at first hand.I believe this experience will be unforgettable for all the students and will be useful for their lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students onboard the flight told RTHK that they were excited to learn more about the aviation industry on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to have this opportunity to take the first C919 flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Through this opportunity, I can learn more about the homegrown aircraft industry on the mainland," said one student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she hoped the seats would be comfy and wondered whether meals would be served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is my first time to take the domestically-made plane. I'm interested to know whether the facilities on the plane will be different than those from other countries," said another student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Andrew Yao who chairs the Federation of Hong Kong-Shanghai Associations, said he hopes students can learn more about the development of the Belt and Road initiative through the internship programme.

    Working together will reduce waste in GBA: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said a proposal to integrate waste management across the Greater Bay Area does not simply mean Hong Kong will send its rubbish for disposal across the border.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister confirmed that the authorities are mulling working with mainland counterparts on handling and recycling waste to achieve carbon neutrality and build a waste-free bay area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tse said the plan is not to ship waste to the rest of the Greater Bay Area for incineration, but to recycle and reuse it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To achieve carbon neutrality, many countries have been promoting resource circulation. This concept is not difficult to understand. It simply means turning resources into products, such as the clothes you are wearing or the chair you are sitting on. It's not sustainable if all these products end up turning into garbage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added he is confident that Hong Kong will be able to deal with a daily average of around 11,000 tonnes of garbage after the territory's three incinerators are put into operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waste integration proposal came after the SAR announced on Monday that it was shelving a territory-wide waste charging scheme for a third time. The minister reiterated that the move does not mean the government is pausing its waste reduction efforts.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Friday said it strongly disapproved and condemned the US Department of State for proposing visa restriction on Beijing and SAR officials responsible for implementing the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Washington said on Friday that it was taking steps to put the visa restrictions in place after the trial under the NSL of 47 people on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion. It gave no further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the defendants were acquitted and fourteen were found guilty, with the remainder pleading guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a spokesman for the SAR government said: “The proposed imposition of the so-called 'visa restrictions' by the US Government smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate PRC and HKSAR officials who resolutely safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong's affairs, and violate the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR despises such threat and will not be intimidated by such a despicable behaviour.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement added that the SAR would continue to do its duty in safeguarding national security, adding that the findings of the judges in the case on Wednesday “clearly confirmed that the criminal acts in the case aimed at undermining, destroying or overthrowing the existing political system and structure of the HKSAR established under the Basic Law and the 'one country, two systems' principle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such criminal acts endangering national security had nothing to do with the so-called fight for democracy and human rights,” the statement added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrics expert on Saturday said there's been no easing of the winter flu outbreak in Hong Kong, and he expects the situation to continue for several more weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Hong Kong said the number of influenza cases would usually fall off in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The condition of the influenza outbreak [had] been persistent throughout May, and we are expecting actually even in June, there will still be a few more weeks of influenza outbreak affecting many of our young children," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, we find most of those severe influenza cases, including the death cases, occur more dominantly in young children, particularly with those without any influenza vaccination."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged parents to get their children vaccinated. Four children have died of flu so far this year.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Friday that businesses he met on a visit to California only wanted to talk about the business environment in Hong Kong and did not raise national security matters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan made a visit to San Francisco, together with delegations from Guangdong Province and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong and partners in San Francisco signed three memorandums of understanding on developing carbon markets, sustainable finance, investment promotion and the nurturing of talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief said businesses in the United States were "curious" and "interested" in the opportunities available in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The business proposition we put to the business sector here is that the Greater Bay Area as a market is of huge size: 87 million people. This is one of the most affluent, most dynamic, economically very high vitality areas," he told reporters in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Presenting tremendous opportunities for the business sector here, no matter if it is for consumer market or for extending the service or solutions onto the mainland, the exchanges that we have with them proved this proposition to be quite attractive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding national security, Chan said businesses in the United States had other concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No question has ever been raised in this respect... In fact, the concern and the interest of the business sector here is the stability of Hong Kong, the overall business environment, the impact of high interest rates on Hong Kong, and also the performance of stock market, the property market, as well as foreign business interest and investment in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan was due to arrive back in the SAR on Saturday morning.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong says the innovation and technology sector in Hong Kong has made a lot of progress in the past few years with the I&T ecosystem becoming more vibrant than before, adding that the SAR serves as a super value adder to foster global collaboration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said that the SAR has the advantages to becoming an international I&T centre with its top institutions, experts and scholars, a mature intellectual property rights protection system, a robust rule of law and a good business environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past few years, the Hong Kong government has invested more than HK$210 billion to enhance technological research infrastructure, subsidise R&D activities, support collaboration among industry, academic and research sectors, as well as put together nurtured technology talents," he told RTHK's Your Home Address programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that the SAR has rolled out a number of policies to attract, retain and nurture talents, including the Technology Talent Admission Scheme, meant for admitting technology talents to conduct R&D work in Hong Kong, the STEM Internship Scheme for university students to gain experience in the field and the New Industrialisation and Technology Training Programme to subsidise training for staff in local companies on advanced technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I put together local and non-local researchers to conduct world-class and impactful scientific research. For this InnoHK research clusters, this is a very successful programme aiming to promote the global research collaboration. So far, we have established 29 InnoHK research centres in Hong Kong Science Park in collaboration with more than 30 top-notch universities and research institutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the two clusters, one is life and health technology and the other one is robotics and AI. To further expand this successful programme, we are going to build a third cluster focused on advanced manufacturing, sustainable development, new energy and material as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the recently launched Research Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) has been very successful in supporting hundreds of university research teams to transfer their research outcomes into real applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said that authorities would accelerate digital economy development to build Hong Kong into a smart city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The Digital Policy Office] will be responsible for formulating policies on digital government, data governance and information technology, promoting the opening up of data and offering more digital services. This office will be in charge of introducing more digital government initiative for convenience and benefit of the public and business sector," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we plan to launch over 100 digital government smart city initiatives including providing the digital payments for all government services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the office would also work closely with the Guangdong province to promote cross-boundary public services initiative in both areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun believes that Hong Kong can put together the innovation resources from the GBA and the world to promote development and investment, making the territory the best springboard for overseas markets to venture into the GBA, the mainland and the Asian market.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal at 5:40 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It had been issued at 3:25 am, and heavy rain was expected to fall generally over Hong Kong, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory had warned that there might be flooding in some low-lying and poorly drained areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who were likely to be affected were advised to take all necessary precautions to reduce their exposure to risk posed by the heavy rain and flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People should stay alert to the danger that may be brought about by river flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said people should stay away from watercourses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Saturday afternoon that the Strong Wind Signal No 3 would be replaced sometime between 3pm and 6pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said at noon that Tropical Cyclone Maliksi had weakened into a tropical depression as it passed over Guangdong province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory says it will consider issuing either the Standby Signal No 1 or the Strong Monsoon Signal, depending on how Maliksi weakens over inland areas and changes in the local wind conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that seas will be rough with swells and members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Strong Wind Signal No 3 is still in force, classes of kindergartens, schools for children with physical disability and schools for children with intellectual disability are suspended today.

 Police said a woman arrested on Wednesday is suspected of committing the offence of “providing pecuniary or other financial assistance or property for the commission of secession by other persons” under the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said their investigation revealed the woman had provided HK$140,000 to fugitive Nathan Law and other individuals through an online subscription platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman was one of seven people arrested this week on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, which include former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were linked to suspected seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 4.40pm, and added it would remain in force until at least 6am on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming said the chance of issuing a higher signal is rather low, unless Tropical Storm Maliksi rapidly intensifies or tracks closer to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Maliksi would make landfall in the western part of Guangdong around midnight tonight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of 5pm, Maliksi was estimated to be about 290 kilometres southwest of Hong Kong. It is forecast to be slow-moving at first, and then move northwards later at about 15 kilometres per hour, edging closer to the western coast of Guangdong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we look at the radar imageries, we can see that the squally showers and strong winds associated with Maliksi are gradually affecting the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary. Local winds will strengthen progressively."

    Hong Kong retail sales fall in April

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The value of total retail sales for April dropped nearly 15 percent compared with the same month in 2023. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755577_1_20240531170816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Provisional data from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the city's retail sales for April fell 14.7 percent from a year earlier, partly due to a drop in visitor spending and a large number of outbound trips during the Easter holidays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales decreased to HK$29.6 billion in the second consecutive month of decline after a seven percent drop in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first four months of 2024 taken together, it was provisionally estimated the value of total retail sales decreased by 4.7 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in April 2024 saw it decrease by 16.5 percent compared with a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined notably in April from a year earlier, partly because the Easter holidays rendered the effects of the changing consumption pattern of residents more visible," a government spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large number of residents made outbound trips during the Easter holidays. This not only affected their local consumption during their time away but also could have reduced consumption in the days before and after the trips."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that unstable weather in April also had an impact on spending. Looking ahead, he said the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents would continue to pose a challenge to the local retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the government hoped the revival of inbound tourism and rising earnings, as well as the new round of mega events plus the recent stabilisation of asset markets such as property would provide support to the market and boost the economy.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday condemned criticisms made by the United States, Western countries, anti-China organisations and politicians, as well as foreign media over the recent subversion trial involving 47 defendants, calling them groundless.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled they had sought to subvert state power by participating in an unsanctioned "primary election" organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the court had carefully considered the law, evidence and arguments presented by the prosecution and defence during the 118-day trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said the verdict clearly stated the conspiracy in this case was aimed at undermining or overthrowing the political system and structure of the Hong Kong SAR, which is established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such illegal acts, which endanger national security, have nothing to do with the so-called fight for democracy and human rights," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 47 people were charged in the case. With the exception of two individuals, for whom there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the court that they were involved in the conspiracy, all 45 others were convicted, demonstrating the scale and seriousness of the conspiracy. The Department of Justice has informed the court of its intention to appeal against the acquittal of the two defendants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government demanded that the US and other Western countries, anti-China organisations and politicians, and foreign media stop spreading false reports and malicious attacks on the court's ruling in this case.

  Health authorities said in a statement that false advertisements carrying the department's logo claimed the government would provide medical insurance for people aged 55 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they have reported the case to police, adding that all remarks in those advertisements are false.

 The Observatory said the strong wind signal No. 3 will be issued at 4.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A tropical depression over the northern part of the South China Sea is forecast to move north, edging closer to the western coast of Guangdong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said according to the present forecast track, it will make landfall in western Guangdong from Friday evening to early Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said while the tropical depression is expected to move across inland of western Guangdong, the associated rainbands will still affect Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 3.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The standby signal No 1 has been in force since 5.40pm on Thursday.

    Licensed taxi fleet investment 'could top HK$100mn'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Licence applications for taxi fleets ended on Friday, with an industry representative saying his group would invest more than HK$100 million in a squad of cabs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The licensed taxi fleet system is part of wider efforts to improve the service quality of point-to-point transport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the government, fleets operating in urban areas should have 300 to 1,000 taxis each, whereas those in the New Territories should have 100 to 350 cabs each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And participating taxis must not be in use for more than three years when a licence is offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities are expected to issue a maximum of five licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Yue-ting, from the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, said he believes around eight applications were submitted before the noon deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Wong said he and 12 other operators have joined hands in applying for a licence in the New Territories, in hopes of improving cab services there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the group would have to invest at least HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I estimate that, for the first six months, we would invest HK$3 million to HK$5 million in a taxi-hailing service, plus dash cameras and other systems in the vehicles," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the vehicles, we'll mostly have to replace the existing ones because many of them would have been in use for more than three years when they are licensed. I think more than 80 percent of the taxis no longer fit the requirement. Each taxi will cost about HK$400,000, which means an expenditure of HK$100 million to replace some 300 vehicles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, said he submitted an application for a fleet of about 400 taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said mainland ride-hailing giants Didi Chuxing and Gaode had contacted him on proposing to work together.

    'Ruling shows national security risks exist in HK'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The court ruling on a subversion trial showed that national security risks exist in Hong Kong, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, three national security judges convicted 14 people of conspiring to commit subversion, relating to an opposition plot to take control of the Legislative Council to disrupt government operations. Prosecutors also announced their intention to appeal against the acquittal of two others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said people have to read the court verdict carefully and safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the government will take action against anti-China behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The court ruling reflects that national security risks in Hong Kong truly exist. It's not like what some people said that they were just chanting some slogans and advocating for freedom. Their goal was to destroy Hong Kong, disrupt Hong Kong's constitutional order, paralyse the Hong Kong government, and on a deeper level, use Hong Kong as a base to inhibit the country's development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one fighting for democracy and freedom would hope to paralyse the government or have the streets filled with petrol bombs, Chan said.

 <br>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said the cyclone would make landfall tonight, or early tomorrow morning, before moving inland, and that Hong Kong would see heavy showers on Saturday.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government stressed Hong Kong’s homegrown national security ordinance only targets an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755439_1_20240530222134.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Thursday said it strongly disapproves of, and condemns all baseless allegations by the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and the European Union (EU) against the city’s homegrown national security law as well as law enforcement action taken by the police’s National Security Department.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The police made seven arrests on Tuesday and Wednesday on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seven were accused of being responsible for seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CECC and EU had described the arrests as a violation of human rights and an attempt to stifle freedom of expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a statement published on Thursday, authorities said their claims simply do not stand up to the facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation,” the statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Offences in connection with seditious intention are very serious crimes, and no jurisdictions, including the US and those from the EU, will watch with folded arms acts and activities that endanger national security.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government stressed Hong Kong’s homegrown national security ordinance only targets an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security, adding that it will not hinder legitimate expression of opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against acts and activities endangering national security. Only invaders who want to intrude into our home to plunder and loot should be worried by the Ordinance,” the statement added.

 Police said five people were arrested near West Kowloon Court on Thursday for alleged disorderly conduct in public places
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said four people, aged between 32 and 68, failed to follow instructions when they entered the court building. They also ignored officers' verbal warnings and chanted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force added that they arrested another 32-year-old man after he chanted inside the court area and refused to cooperate with officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All five suspects are detained on suspicion of engaging in disorderly conduct in a public place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police reminded members of the public to abide by the law and express their views in a peaceful and orderly manner, without undermining national and public security.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said the court ruling on a national security trial confirmed there was a conspiracy to commit subversion, which also showed the seriousness of the case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Lee said the judgement handed down by a three-judge panel showed there was a conspiracy to subvert state power and to destroy and overthrow the existing political system and structure established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the convictions of 45 of the 47 defendants showed the scale and severity of the plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 16 who pleaded not guilty, 14 were convicted of conspiring to commit subversion and two were acquitted. Thirty-one others pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that the Department of Justice had indicated its intention to appeal against the acquittals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR is duty-bound to safeguard national security, and is determined to fight any acts that compromise this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the subversion saga had harmed Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no winner out of this case. This is a very sad story that some Hong Kong people tried to conduct subversion of Hong Kong. I think it is good that we were able to interdict the plot so that the Hong Kong citizens will not suffer and Hong Kong will now resume to a normal state," he told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 and said it would remain in effect until at least 6am on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a tropical cyclone located about 800 kilometres from Hong Kong could affect the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad area of low pressure in the South China Sea has become a tropical depression, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said strong winds were not expected to have a significant impact on the region yet, but the tropical depression could move closer to the coast and strengthen slightly during Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would assess the need to issue the Strong Wind Signal No 3 based on the storm's intensity, as well as local wind conditions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice on Thursday announced its intention to appeal against the acquittal of two of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were among 16 defendants who pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a verdict delivered on Thursday morning, the judges said they were not sure if Lau and Lee had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the lunch break, Director of Public Prosecutions Maggie Yang told the court that the Department of Justice intends to appeal using the amended Criminal Procedure Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She requested that the pair be kept on bail, pending a decision on the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee's defence counsel argued against that, saying his client should be a "free man" unless the court grants the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-judge panel decided to extend the bail of Lau and Lee. They are now required to report to police on a monthly basis, instead of twice every week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also said mitigation hearings for those convicted are scheduled for June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the media, chief superintendent Steve Li from the police's National Security Department welcomed the conviction of 14 defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the judgement, you can see that the court regarded this as a very serious case. This is a very illicit plot... The ultimate goal is to paralyse the government," he said.

 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 at 5.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea will soon develop into a tropical depression. It is expected to gradually move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory added that there will be squally showers and thunderstorms in the coming days, while winds offshore and on high ground will strengthen.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electronic queuing systems for taxis have been brought in at the arrival hall to reduce queues during extreme weather, the Airport Authority said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven Yiu, the executive director of airport operations, said the system was introduced in March this year after people had to queue for hours last year during a typhoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a mobile phone notification or the airport's information board would now tell passengers when their taxi was ready.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to avoid a long queuing for prolonged-waiting passengers. For example, if the typhoon lasts three to four hours, we don't let the passengers keep queuing for long periods of time, so we give them some sort of queuing number so they can stay in the restaurant and also rest until being called forward to the taxi station," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We created a resting area, actually it is a large area with over 500 chairs, with Wifi [and a] charging facility. We will also distribute water, biscuits to them, and also some blankets as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authority hopes to make passengers feel comfortable, especially when taxis and Airport Express trains can't operate under Typhoon Signal No 9.

    Judges cite intention in acquitting two defendants

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three judges presiding over a subversion trial centred on an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations said in their ruling on Thursday that two of the defendants were acquitted because they were not sure if the pair had the intention to subvert state power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the judgement, former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun never advocated vetoing government budgets in the election forum they had attended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution argued during the trial that the suspects planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure to be introduced by the government, had they become Legco members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, the judges said although Lau's name appeared on a declaration of poll candidates, they were not sure if he had signed it himself or authorised someone to sign it on his behalf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the "Inked without Regret" declaration agreed to use the vetoing power of lawmakers to force the chief executive to respond to the five demands of protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a fact that [Lau] did not post the [declaration] on his Facebook page and he did not make use of the [declaration] in his electioneering work," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said although the now-disbanded Civic Party, which Lee belonged to, endorsed the declaration, he was not yet a candidate at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also noted that Lee had asked his election team to come up with a new pamphlet that did not mention the five demands after looking at the national security law, which took effect in June 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released after the verdict at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still other defendants in this case, warranting our concern and even love," Lau told reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's any star in this case, this judgement should be the star. It sets the jurisprudence, reasoning, logic, perspectives of our judges. Please study it. This is more important than any single individual of this case. This is part of our rule of law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the first thing he'd like to do was to have a meal with his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel calm, as I have always been... Thank you to everyone who have been concerned about us and expressing your care. We all can feel that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there is a tendency for the prosecution to apply for an appeal, so I cannot make any comment on this case at this moment."

    Use of force not necessary for subversion, court finds

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The court ruled that those who intentionally commit an act that contravenes the national security law with the intent to subvert state power don't have to use force or know they're breaching the law to be found guilty." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755349_1_20240530121750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A landmark ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date has set out that those who plot to subvert state power need not use force or employ criminal means to be found guilty of breaching the national security law (NSL), nor do they need to know that their tactics were unlawful.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan laid out their reasoning in a 319-page judgement, which found 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion while acquitting two. Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to the same charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges concluded that those convicted had taken part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government by unlawful means with a view to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court found that they had planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure request by the government if they win a majority in the Legislative Council election in 2020, to compel the chief executive to accede to demands made by anti-government protesters or be forced to dissolve the legislature and resign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges rejected arguments by defence lawyers that "unlawful means" necessitates the use or threat of force; that guilty parties must know that what they were doing was illegal; and that Legco members who veto government budgets are merely exercising their constitutional duty instead of breaking the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ruling, the judges noted that the NSL was drafted with the understanding that national security in the city could be undermined not only by force, but also by non-violent actions such as advocating Hong Kong's independence, inciting public hatred, and paralysing the work of the government and legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said limiting "unlawful means" to acts of force would be such a narrow interpretation that "would be absurd and illogical and defeat the purpose of the NSL".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also swept aside defence arguments that "other unlawful means" should only include criminal acts, saying it’s “inconceivable that acts or activities by whatever forms and methods with a view to subverting the state power could be considered to be acceptable or tolerable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moreover, they ruled that the defendants did not have to be aware that they were breaching the law at the time of the offence, so long as the accused had intentionally committed an unlawful act with a view to subverting state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Therefore, it was irrelevant to the issue of guilt that the accused acted with a mistaken belief that his or her means was lawful; to hold otherwise would go against the purpose of the NSL,” the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the judges agreed that legislators should not automatically approve government budgets, any plan to indiscriminately veto such budgets in an attempt to force the government to accept political demands would, they concluded, constitute an abuse of power that contravenes both the Basic Law and the NSL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also dismissed defence claims that the offence wasn’t clearly defined because the law doesn’t provide specific definitions for "subversion" or "state power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said it was obvious that all the powers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ultimately came from the Constitution and the Central People's Government, and concluded that "state power" refers to those wielded by the SAR government, including the various duties and functions it performs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a dictionary definition of "subversion", the judges ruled that “a serious interference in, disruption or undermining of the performance of duties and functions in accordance with the law by the body of power of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region… could amount to an act ‘subverting the State power’.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As such, they found that 14 defendants had knowingly participated in the plot, with the intention of subverting state power, and therefore found them guilty.

    FS hopes for stronger ties between China, US bay areas

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has told the business community in Berkeley, California that he hopes there will be further financial and technological exchanges between the state's bay area and the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and the University of Hong Kong both signed a memorandum of understanding with a California-based climate institute to cooperate in areas such as talent exchanges, green fintech and carbon market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope, too, that we can encourage financial and technological exchanges. The global gap for green funding and technology is enormous, measured in trillions of US dollars. Let's turn this need into opportunities,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to say that Hong Kong is a great place to do business in Asia, being the "super connector" between China and the rest of the world, and invited US businesses to pay a visit to the SAR to see what is on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also told attendees at a climate event that Hong Kong is committed to a greener future and that the SAR plans to reach carbon neutrality in the coming decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are adopting a four-pronged strategy to reach neutrality: net-zero electricity generation, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Indeed, we were among the first cities in Asia to take action against climate change… Our carbon emissions peaked in 2014 and have shown a general downward trend since.”

 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 if a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea develops into a tropical depression.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the low-pressure area is still loosely organised but may intensify. It is expected to move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.

  It added that there will be showers, thunderstorms and strong winds in the coming days, while offshore winds will also strengthen.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The group in charge of promoting patriotic education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee on Thursday said it is going to hold design contests in which participants create mascots and logos that reflect the theme of "love our country, love Hong Kong, and love our community."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The competitions would be held in separate primary, secondary, and tertiary divisions. The winning design could be used in events celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners and the first and second runner-ups would also receive annual passes to the Hong Kong Palace Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registration for the competition starts today and will close on July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's convenor, Starry Lee, said all schools in the SAR would be invited to join the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have designed a theme that is ‘to love our motherland, to love Hong Kong and to love the community’. We need a logo or symbol to represent this main theme. We will issue a letter to all schools in the community, including universities, secondary and primary schools, to invite all schools to join and participate in this competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hopefully, we can find some very symbolic design so that we can use in other part of our activities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while participation is voluntary, she expects a lot of students would join the contests.

 Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by participating in an unsanctioned 'primary election' organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.

  <br/>
  Two others – former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun – were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those convicted in the subversion case were Gordon Ng, Tat Cheng, Clarisse Yeung, Michael Pang, Kalvin Ho, Helena Wong, Sze Tak-loy, Gwyneth Ho, Raymond Chan, Owen Chow, Lam Cheuk-ting, Leung Kwok-hung, Ricky Or and Winnie Yu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were remanded in custody, pending sentencing.

    Robots help with spine surgery at Queen Mary Hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Over the past eight months, robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at the hospital. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755312_1_20240530094044.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at Queen Mary Hospital since October. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong say the robot can help surgeons be more precise and accurate when placing screws, and thus reduce the risk of complications and the need for more surgery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jason Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong's medical school, led the research team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say there are a couple of aspects that it improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First it of course increases patient safety. So in the past when we are doing the surgeries, where we insert the screws, they are all done by free hand, meaning that it is up to the surgeons' experience to identify where the correct position is for the screws...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secondly, it helps the surgeon with the overall process of the surgery. Surgeons no longer need to be completely concentrated to put screws in accurately. They can actually put their major part of the concentration into more risky procedures, such as decompression of the nerves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Cheung said surgeons would still remain in overall control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So even to this day when I am using the robot, despite it guiding me, I will still always check whether the track of the screws are correct or not. So I will always double-check myself by feel, perhaps an X-ray just to confirm whether everything is accurate," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Cheung said the robot didn't just help with inserting the screws. He said, prior to surgery, surgeons would take a CT scan from the patient and plan where to put the screws. The system would then match this with the plan and guide the surgeon.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court is set to begin delivering a verdict on whether 16 opposition figures breached the national security law by participating in an unofficial legislative primary election four years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Queues formed outside the West Kowloon Court where the hearing is held amid tightened security and a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixteen defendants who have pleaded not guilty are expecting to hear their fate after a subversion trial lasting 118 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, they could face up to life in prison although sentencing is expected later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among the 47 politicians and activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities alleged that an unofficial Legco primary election in July 2020 was a subversive attempt by the opposition camp to win a majority in Legco and paralyse the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 16 who stood trial include former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, and journalist-turned-activist Gwyneth Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was centred on whether they conspired to subvert state power by planning to indiscriminately vote down the budget and force the then-Chief Executive to resign through their participation in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others, including former legal scholar Benny Tai and ex-student activist Joshua Wong, pleaded guilty to their charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judiciary has set aside more than 400 seats for the public to hear the verdict on Thursday - the largest national security case to date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three national security judges - Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan - presided over the jury-free trial.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National security police on Wednesday said they arrested one more person on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Six people, including the former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were arrested on Tuesday and linked to seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that a 53-year-old woman arrested on Wednesday is the wife of one of those taken into custody the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers are not ruling out further arrests.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ICAC says football players, coaches and betting agents are linked to the match-fixing syndicate.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Wednesday said it arrested 12 people, including footballers and coaches, for alleged match-fixing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said the head coach, a midfielder and a goalkeeper of a football team in the Hong Kong Premier League were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also taken into custody were a coach and five players from two teams in the third-tier Second Division. Three betting agents were arrested as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC did not name the suspects or their clubs, citing an ongoing investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged offences took place over three seasons, beginning with the 2021 campaign, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matthew Chang, a principal investigator with the ICAC, said the coaches allegedly communicated with players with signals during the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They would give some secret signals during the match if they can recruit some players in the same team, like moving their head or using their body language, gestures, to show that at which specific times the involved players have to do something, like to keep going to score or just stop to defend,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said each player could get up to tens of thousands of dollars for each match fixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also believed that some of those arrested placed bets in illegal gambling for gains, with the amount of bets topping HK$1 million in one season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said the suspects have been released on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Football Association of Hong Kong, China said it will fully assist the ICAC in the investigation, stressing that it has "zero tolerance" towards football corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the association said if the allegations are proven true, it will severely punish the clubs, players and coaches involved by revoking their memberships and imposing lifetime suspensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Premier League expressed regret over the incident, adding that it will work with the football association to create a fair and clean football industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said it will not tolerate illegal acts. The bureau said it will urge the local football association to work with ICAC and improve the anti-corruption awareness of football clubs.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang says officials are actively taking forward the relevant work in response to a Court of Final Appeal order. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755192_1_20240529142204.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said efforts are underway to respond to a court order on formulating an official framework to recognise same-sex partnerships following a landmark ruling last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Court of Final Appeal ruled last September that the government has a constitutional duty to allow gay couples to register their partnerships, in a case brought by former activist Jimmy Sham who married his male partner in New York in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top court said the government would be given two years to come up with an alternative framework so that same-sex relationships could be provided legal recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to a request by lawmaker Regina Ip for an update on the situation, constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang said officials are "actively taking forward the relevant work" and will seek the views of the Legislative Council in due course, once there are concrete suggestions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the matter is complex and involves a wide range of issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now following the court's relevant judgment and timetable, conducting detailed study with the [Department of Justice] and relevant bureaux on the mechanism relating to the legal recognition of same-sex relationship, thresholds of recognition, eligibilities, conditions, how to effectively avoid abuses of the alternative framework, etc, as well as the rights and obligations arisen, including 'core rights' and 'supplementary rights', and formulating implementation," he said.

<img alt="Paul Chan met with representatives from five SAR startups currently exploring opportunities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755181_3_20240529124657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday told business leaders in San Francisco that the SAR is a “natural launching pad” for them to enter the Asian and China markets, as he promoted collaboration between the China-US bay areas on a five-day trip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a business luncheon, Chan said there were many commonalities between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area, with the two places the global engines of technological innovation and also the birthplaces of tech firm giants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area are a magnet, attracting a lot of talent, that is our competitive advantage, and also this will give us continuous impetus in terms of innovation and technological development,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to point out there’s also a difference between the two places in terms of population and market sizes, as the Californian bay area has a population of about seven million, while the Guangdong bay area population stands at some 87 million, with huge market potential contributing to some 12 percent of the Chinese economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So if you want to launch your products or services in Asia, in China, Hong Kong is naturally your launching pad, because from here you can springboard to other parts of the mainland and Asia,” he told delegates, noting the SAR’s financial markets are much bigger in breadth and depth compared with Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between InvestHK and San Francisco’s Bay Area Council to promote cooperation especially in the green economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the finance minister also met with representatives of five Hong Kong startups currently exploring expansion in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five SAR startups specialise in areas including biodegradable materials, new construction materials, online marketing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and the entrepreneurs are exploring the market there whilst undertaking training programmes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also welcomed a plan by a Silicon Valley startup accelerator company to set up a technological innovation centre in the SAR.
