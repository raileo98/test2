<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's investment promotion agency on Tuesday said it assisted 322 companies to establish or expand their business in Hong Kong in the first half of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was 43 percent more compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  InvestHK said the companies injected over HK$38.3 billion into the economy and created more than 3,500 jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the Director-General of Investment Promotion, Alpha Lau, said these companies are from 33 economies, with nearly half from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the mainland enterprises, over the past years, the percentage had always been hovering around 35 percent, because Hong Kong is an international city that's a springboard into the rest of the world," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are unlike any other Chinese city, which is why even Chinese enterprises have to come to Hong Kong. Most of them do anyway, to set up the first stepping stone or international headquarters to go outside of China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-four percent of the 322 firms helped so far this year are from the financial services and FinTech sectors, while 19 percent are from the innovation and technology industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau also said InvestHK is currently scrutinising 310 applications received since March for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, which aims to attract high-net-worth individuals to Hong Kong. She said she expects the scheme to bring in investments exceeding HK$9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, Lau said the agency will focus its promotional efforts in the coming months on the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as in the Middle East and North Africa.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new permit for non-Chinese permanent residents of Hong Kong to travel to the mainland without a visa is proving to be very popular, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China Travel Service will issue the permits from July 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee described Beijing's move as a breakthrough that will "take good care" of foreign residents of the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we're going to improve the arrangements with the China Travel Service. We'll listen to views so as to optimise the arrangements," the CE said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District councillor and deputy school head Rizwan Ullah said ethnic minority residents often find the application process for travel visas to be complicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new card will make it more convenient for students to go on study trips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of InvestHK, Alpha Lau, said foreign residents are hailing the new arrangement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, in one day, I've already gotten a lot of very positive feedback from foreign chambers to say how wonderful the Hong Kong government is for doing this, for facilitating this together with the central government," she told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Grace Citizen’s young number nine, Li Hau-yi, is a rising star in women’s football in Hong Kong. She dreams of representing the SAR, but ironically, her path to success may first take her away from the city, where she can best develop her game by competing against elite players in a professional league.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to be someone who contributes to Hong Kong’s football scene. My goal is to secure a ‘first eleven’ spot on the Hong Kong team. I also hope to be a role model for others; someone people are proud to have as a friend, or a family member," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To make the next step, the 17-year-old will have to take a break from her studies to move to a side in the Chinese Super League because Hong Kong does not have a professional women’s league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said this way, she can concentrate on the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think being a footballer in Hong Kong, in my experience, is quite difficult," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I go to school in the morning at eight, and then practise until around nine or ten in the evening. Sometimes I arrive home at eleven before having to wake up early again the next day," she said, describing her average day in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   <br/>
   Li’s teammate, Iris Kwok, 30, knows a thing or two about the challenges of playing professionally outside of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok played in the territory’s amateur and semi-professional leagues for two decades before Spanish second-tier side Rayo Vallecano added her to their roster in March. Kwok said the transition was tough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The playing-level is high there, whether that is the technique or physicality, so it took a bit of time to adapt. The players are very professional and they come really prepared. Their technique is incredible and their speed is fast so, after training with them, I feel like I have improved a lot."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But joining the squad partway through the season meant Kwok was unable to register with the Spanish league, and so did not feature for the Vallecano first team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_4_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Kwok’s coach at Citizen, Leung Kwun-chung, said he was not surprised his former captain caught the eye of an overseas side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leung noted that the path Kwok has gone down is one of the things that could benefit local football in the long term, adding that Kwok’s experience abroad had inspired her teammates at Citizen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I'm trying to provide more chances for the players to play at the highest level. And once they come back, supposedly the general standard, the club standard, or the level of Hong Kong will be increased."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_6_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
     <div class="image-title-1">
      <span>
      </span>
     </div>
     <br/>
     Leung has been coaching Grace Citizen for two years, but he is better known for his achievements as a player. The defender and midfielder has eleven caps for the Hong Kong men's international team, and has a Premier League trophy to his name with local side Tai Po.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, as a coach, he quickly learnt that the women's game is very different; with precious few resources, but plenty of potential.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Men's football in Hong Kong, maybe they've already got the model…You cannot change too much,” he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "But the women's world is totally different. Maybe they’ve just started, it’s just the beginning. We don't have the professional league, and maybe one of the advantages of that is we don't have any limitations."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_8_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
      <div class="image-title-1">
       <span>
       </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Leung said he is trying to make the most of the resources he has at his disposal. That means he is boosting social media exposure, and trying to fill gaps in staffing to maximise players’ potential.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And all this, he hopes, will raise the profile of women’s football in the SAR and attract more money and resources to the sport.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Coach Leung's philosophy at Grace Citizen is having a knock-on effect among the younger members of his squad, one that is epitomised by Li.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "I am so keen to go abroad, whenever more people are sent out, it rouses my determination, which makes me work harder, and believe in myself more.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong should capitalise on the measures announced by Beijing in supporting the local economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said an increase in duty-free allowance for mainland residents was something that was not easy to come by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Monday, the amount was tripled from 5,000 to 15,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This has been achieved after a lot of efforts by different ministries and authorities of the central government," Lee told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's important that we make good use of the new arrangement so that the benefits will be realised to its best potential."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said officials will keep reviewing different measures and discuss with the central authorities ways to enhance Hong Kong's economic development and tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said as Hong Kong's economy is in a transitional phase, people have to accept that and find ways to improve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can't rest on our own laurels to just think of present or past successes... So I urge everybody to think of innovative ways to capitalise on the new measures that have been offered to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that various measures in support of Hong Kong can bring major synergy effects.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said authorities will head to Sichuan to discuss arrangements for Hong Kong to receive two pandas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was announced on July 1 that the central government will send the pandas to the SAR as a gift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he hopes the pandas will arrive within a few months, and he believes they will attract tourists from around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether there will be a naming contest for the pandas, Lee said the government will first go to Sichuan to discuss details of the arrangement with mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the important thing is ensure that the arrangement for the giant pandas' arrival will be smooth and safe because I know that there will be quarantine requirements and all the necessary procedures need to be followed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have experience of receiving the gifts of giant pandas from central authorities, and Ocean Park has been doing an excellent job in ensuring that they are well taken care of."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link should have had a soft opening to reduce the mega infrastructure project's novelty factor, according to the CEO of a transport consultancy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new 24-kilometre link across the Pearl River Delta opened on Sunday but traffic was gridlocked as many drivers stopped on the bridge to take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of the congestion we are seeing at the moment, those are just novelty factors," said Alok Jai, CEO of Trans-Consult, on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And normally when we open infrastructure like that, usually you should have a soft opening - which gives people the chance to take pictures and look around and appreciate it - before you do the full opening, or proper opening, then it becomes a proper transport linkage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in the gridlock. One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain welcomed the link, saying it would take pressure off the Humen Bridge at the north of the Pearl River Delta and improve connectivity within the region. But he said he didn't think it would cut journey times between Shenzhen and Zhongshan to 30 minutes from two hours, which had been widely reported ahead of the opening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is certainly going to reduce it by 45 minutes or so. But that in itself - as far as we talk about the connectivity within the Pearl River Delta, or the Greater Bay Area - that is a significant saving in journey times," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain also said he expected the new link to take traffic away from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which is more expensive. He said Hongkongers heading to Zhongshan may opt for the new link instead of going via Zhuhai. But he said the main beneficiaries would be those living in the Shenzhen or Zhongshan areas and those using the Humen Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link consists of two bridges, two artificial islands and an under-sea tunnel.

 Hongkongers and tourists enjoyed a wide range of freebies and discounts on Monday as the city celebrated July 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Many took advantage of the free light rail and tram trips on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There happened to be a free tram service, so I feel really lucky. It shows the characteristics of Hong Kong, so I want to experience this," a mainland tourist told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really interested in its double-decker design."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man said despite the tram rides being free, there weren’t too many passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe a lot of Hong Kong people went up to the mainland during this three-day holiday, so there aren't many people... Because there are too many people crossing the border, so we tried to avoid going to the mainland during this period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other people, meanwhile, took the opportunity to visit museums for free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A girl said she enjoyed her trip to the Science Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy because I don't have to spend money for tickets. I can also go and play everywhere and I don't have to go to school," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man visited the M+ Museum at the West Kowloon Cultural District for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't come if I have to pay... I came [an hour] earlier because I can queue indoor and enjoy the air conditioning," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, not everybody was aware of the promotions on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now discovered that there're discounts and freebies offered, and these may also have contributed to the festive atmosphere. But we didn't know about that before, so more promotion may be needed," a woman said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has expressed joy over the central government’s decision to send two pandas to Hong Kong as gifts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The park’s chairman, Paulo Pong, said preparations are now underway to receive the new guests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with Ying Ying and Le Le, the new giant pandas will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China with Hong Kong citizens and tourists,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Ocean Park is deeply grateful for the trust placed in us by the central government and the HKSAR government to care for our national treasures.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A regular visitor to Ocean Park told RTHK that she’s very excited about the new pandas, saying she hopes they can be named "Economy" and "Takeoff".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am really looking forward to it. The panda frenzy can boost the economy... I hope they will have panda babies," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two tourists from the mainland, meanwhile, said they will come to Hong Kong again when the new pandas arrive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We couldn't see any pandas when we went to Sichuan. We'd be really thrilled if we can see some in Hong Kong," they said.

 A woman has been charged with murdering her husband in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday night, and she's due to appear in Kwun Tong Court on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The woman, 32, was arrested after she allegedly slashed her sleeping husband with a fruit knife in their flat at LOHAS Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man, 30, suffered multiple wounds and was certified dead at hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers earlier said they were probing the suspect's motives, noting that she had suffered from depression since giving birth around a year and a half ago.

    'Do more to ease traffic on Shenzhen-Zhongshan link'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector representatives have called on mainland officials to do more to smooth out traffic on the new Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, after commuters experienced much longer journey times than expected amid heavy congestion on its opening day on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new mega-project - which comprises two bridges, two artificial islands, and a tunnel – was supposed to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in a gridlock for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some vehicles stopped on the bridge and people were taking photos. There should have been four lanes available, but when the problem was at its peak, there were only two," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The traffic capacity was reduced by half, leading to traffic congestion. Transport departments and officers could have done better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, pointed out that it took him about five hours to reach Shenzhen from Zhongshan on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes mainland authorities will handle the issue by, for example, banning commuters from taking photos on bridges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will keep an eye on the situation for one or two more weeks. I will also see what happens this coming Saturday and Sunday," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will make decisions on tour group arrangements depending on the traffic situation, especially for those heading to the west side of the Pearl River Delta. I think we'll have to keep things flexible and people on tours should be aware of this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach operator Eternal East Bus, meanwhile, said it anticipates a 30 percent jump in passenger numbers with the opening of the new link, and will increase the frequency of buses to Zhongshan accordingly.

    Non-Chinese HK residents to get mainland travel cards

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Authorities said non-Chinese permanent residents can start applying for the mainland travel permit from July 10. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759771_1_20240701105809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing announced on Monday that non-Chinese Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents can soon apply for mainland travel permits, eliminating their need for visas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Immigration Administration said the move is to facilitate cross-border personnel exchanges, and support the integration of the two SARs into the national development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From July 10, eligible persons can apply for the permit by visiting a China Travel Service outlet in person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The permit will be valid for five years, and holders can enter the mainland multiple times during the period. They can stay up to 90 days per visit," the administration said in an online announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Permit holders will be able to cross the border through e-channels after having their fingerprints collected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they will not be allowed to work, study or engage in activities such as news gathering on the mainland. Those who intend to do so need to apply separately to relevant authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities hope the new policy will make it more convenient for personnel exchanges in areas such as businesses and investment, cultural and tourism as well as education and research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Hong Kong government welcomed the new policy, saying it will greatly enhance border clearance efficiency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee added that it demonstrates the country's care and support for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents have deep roots in Hong Kong. They have been working diligently and making significant contributions to the development of Hong Kong," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure is not limited to any nationality or industry, which fully highlights Hong Kong's unique status under 'one country, two systems' and greatly helps Hong Kong maintain its international character and diversity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that officials have been in close communication with their mainland counterparts in facilitating the flow of talent across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Austrian Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong and Macau also welcomed the arrangement, saying it saves business travellers precious time while those with family ties in the SAR can also take advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As far as I understand, [the arrangement] even applies for children," chairman Wilhelm Brauner said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, it makes your business travel easy, but you can even now extend it to your family and take advantage of these improved procedures to take your family to [mainland China] on a weekend - or on an extended weekend holiday - whatever you might want to do,” he added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Monday that Beijing is to send two pandas to Hong Kong as gifts, as he led top officials and political heavyweights in attending activities marking the 27th anniversary of SAR Establishment Day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At 8am, the CE and more than a hundred guests attended the flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those in attendance were the director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, former Chief Executives Donald Tsang, CY Leung and Carrie Lam, as well as Chief Justice Andrew Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the national and SAR flags were being raised, the guests all stood solemnly facing them while the national anthem was being played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disciplined forces, such as the Government Flying Service and Fire Services Department, gave their salute at Victoria Harbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the brief ceremony outdoors, the guests headed to a reception inside the Convention and Exhibition Centre next door.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the reception speech, the CE announced that Beijing will be sending two pandas to Hong Kong, with the pair being the fifth and sixth pandas to live in Ocean Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I sincerely thank the central government's care and support for the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The officials took up my proposal to send the pandas to Hong Kong as gifts. We are immediately starting preparations to receive them in a few months, and they'll bring us joy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said this is just the first of many good news to come for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive also spoke about the work of the SAR government over the past year, including enacting homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law, as well as attracting more skilled workers to come to Hong Kong.

 Lawmaker Martin Liao and entertainer Andy Lau are among more than 500 people named to this year's Honours List for their contributions to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liao and four others will receive the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the SAR's top award.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Sunday welcomed the opening of a road link that spans the Pearl River Delta and connects Shenzhen with Zhongshan, saying that it helps to promote market integration in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, which opened on Sunday afternoon, is expected to cut the journey time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, traffic jams at both ends of the link marred the first day of operation, and some people complained the journey took much longer than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi said it's necessary to ensure the link is safe and smooth, and that it will help integrate the eastern and western sides of the Pearl River Delta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said he expects it to be a popular tourist spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One out of two enquiries have been asking about the Shenzhen-Zhongshan link for single-day or multi-day tour groups. Customers hope to go to Zhongshan, Shunde or Gudou and spend three days there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man travelling to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong by tour bus said he now expects the journey to be more convenient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I travelled to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong before, I had to go via Shenzhen Bay and Humen. It took me five-and-a-half hours. I want to see whether taking the link will cut my journey time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A restaurant manager in Zhongshan said he expects business to increase after the opening of the transport link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong tour groups contribute to half of our sales for group dining. After the opening of the link, many travel agencies, which didn't previously partner with us, also came to our restaurant to have a look at the environment and the food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The link is 24 kilometres in length and consists of two bridges, two artificial islands, and a two-way, eight-lane tunnel.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive, John Lee, on Sunday said Hong Kong currently has more opportunities than challenges, and the city has to grasp the chance to create more achievements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video marking two years of the current administration, Lee said now is the time for Hong Kong to advance from stability to prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are more opportunities than challenges. Hong Kong society is generally safe and stable now, so it's the best time for development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be innovative while having bottom-line thinking. We have to make timely and appropriate measures according to local conditions when formulating policies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that there were still external challenges, but that Hong Kong would make best use of its advantages.

    Woman arrested after alleged murder at Lohas Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they had arrested a 32-year-old woman on suspicion of murder after her 30-year-old husband was found dead from a knife wound at a flat in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they had received a report about the incident from the suspect's father-in-law at 11.50 pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police rushed to the scene and found the man on the sofa with injuries to his neck. He was sent to Tseung Kwan O Hospital in an unconscious state, where he was declared dead just after 12.30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, assistant district commander Tsang Chun-kit said initial enquiries suggested the woman may have been suffering from depression after giving birth to her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to thoroughly investigate her motive. The mental state of the suspect is one of the key areas that our investigation will focus on. This is because the suspect experienced significant depression after giving birth to her son. She had sought regular treatment from a private doctor," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the couple had been married for five years and had no apparent financial problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that at the time of the incident, their one-and-a-half-year-old son was being taken care of by his paternal grandfather.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, on Sunday said it's time for Hong Kong to take a step forward, after being in a defensive position over the past few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Chan said the city had been safeguarding its financial security and economy since 2019 due to the social unrest and the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the government is working to boost the economy, despite the presence of external challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the short term, we are holding many mega events and inviting people to visit Hong Kong. We hope to make our city more lively and prosperous. After the pandemic, fewer people are coming here, and Western countries may have misunderstandings about Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But businesses, who have come in recent months, feel positive about Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said some countries had criticised but they had been proved wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some said Hong Kong is no longer a financial centre, and that there was an outflow of capital. But if we look at the data, when they were making these slanders in 2023, we still saw a net capital inflow," he said.

    MTR fare rise of 3.09 percent kicks in

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR is offering a complimentary ride for passengers who make 10 trips on the rail network between July 1 and July 28. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759650_1_20240630114507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fares on the MTR rose by 3.09 percent on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The MTR had initially sought 3.2 percent but the government's affordability cap - which is based on the median monthly household income - limited the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase means that an adult passenger using an Octopus card to make the long journey between Tung Chung to Hong Kong Station will have to pay 70 cents more, bringing the total fare to HK$24.3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cushion the initial blow, the rail operator is offering a complimentary ride for passengers who make 10 trips on the rail network between July 1 and July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, this offer is only available to adult passengers who have linked their Octopus cards to the MTR Mobile app.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also excludes the Airport Express and Light Rail.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Saturday said it strongly disapproves of remarks by the US regarding the human rights situation in the city. This came after the US published its 2023 Report on International Religious Freedom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the US report was another attempt to slander the SAR under the guise of religious freedom. It accused the US of piling up false stories and fabricating narratives. It said residents of Hong Kong enjoy the right of religious freedom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also called on the US to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.

    Security chief says being a fugitive has a high cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security Chris Tang on Saturday said that the government revoked the passports of six wanted people this month to send a message that there was a high cost to being a fugitive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an interview to mark the second anniversary of the current administration, Tang said fugitives might also lose any foreign travel documents once they were no longer of use to those harbouring them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know why these people think that, 'maybe I'll still have the opportunity to travel to other places by using my refugee status as a refugee or another status.' I'm not entirely sure in this regard," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But firstly, you'll not be able to use Hong Kong SAR passports to travel; and secondly, while you may now have value because others sympathise with you - and they have granted you travel documents - you might lose those documents, when you no longer have any value. Then you won't be able to travel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The six people wanted here for alleged national security offences under homegrown national security legislation include Nathan Law, Mung Siu-tat, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng, Johnny Fok and Tony Choi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the security minister also called on Alman Chan, the wanted principal of drug rehabilitation centre Christian Zheng Sheng College, to return to Hong Kong from the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others - including Chan, who denies the allegations - were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I noticed that Alman Chan said on social media that 'Oh I did not take any funds from the college and the issue has nothing to do with me, and I'm not involved'.."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this is true, I hope he has the courage to return to Hong Kong and explain to us clearly about the whole matter. On the one hand you are running away, and on the other you are making such remarks. This has no meaning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Tang said authorities would make sure that the July 1 celebrations pass off peacefully.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on why there are now fewer protests on July 1, Tang said that, although protesting is allowed, a protest might be hijacked by people with ulterior motives so residents are choosing other options instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe Hongkongers, after going through what happened in 2019, they clearly know that - while they want to hold a peaceful protest - many people, who wish to endanger national security or Hong Kong's security, might take the opportunity to conduct acts endangering national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said Hong Kong residents know that they might be used, so they have chosen other ways to express their opinions. He also said residents might just feel the government is doing a good job.

 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said that the city's 'One Country, Two Systems' governing principle is a world-recognised success, and that local residents know clearly that there's no change in the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng was speaking at a celebratory event in Victoria Park ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 27 years, which areas in Hong Kong have changed and which have not? While outsiders can pretend not to know, local residents clearly know that there's no change to the city's governing principle," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can clearly see that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle has not changed. The city's high degree of autonomy has not changed, its legal environment has not changed, the business environment has not changed, democracy and freedom have not changed, the way people live their lives has not changed, the city's international character has not changed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And at the same time, we can see all the positive changes in the city since the return to the Motherland. Hong Kong has moved from colonial rule to being the 'apple of the country's eye'," he added, hinting that more policies benefiting the SAR will come along the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also speaking at the event, Chief Executive John Lee again noted that Hong Kong will go all out to boost the economy, in spite of challenges that the SAR might face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is now undergoing economic transformation and it will face different new challenges. But Hong Kong people have always been able to adapt," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So as long as we grasp new opportunities, innovate for change, and strive to be stronger in our various posts... we'll surely reach more glorious achievements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city's top leader also reviewed his work over the past two years via a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include the enactment of the Article 23 legislation, the rolling out of light public housing, efforts to shorten the waiting time for the public housing, the removal of the property cooling measures, as well as the hosting of events to spur economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described his administration as a boat navigating the winds and tides, adding that many policies are gradually bearing fruit.

    Retail sector moves to cater for new allowances

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse, said on Saturday that the industry will aim to offer more products that cater for the new duty-free shopping allowances announced by Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland shoppers heading back to the mainland will see their allowances more than double to 12,000 yuan from 5,000 yuan when returning from Hong Kong and Macau at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yau Tse said that while the increased allowances did not match the annual 100,000 yuan duty-free shopping allowances in the mainland province of Hainan, it's hard to compare the two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [duty-free] system in Hainan island is really different from that in Hong Kong. There are different supporting systems for Hainan to achieve such [a quota], as it has real-name systems to keep track of how many things a customer buys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In addition, the duty-free sales in Hainan are monopolised by one group. In other words, it is much simpler to manage a system within one single group, whereas in Hong Kong, we have so many retailers, all of which are duty-free. So how can we set up one system with them all together? It is challenging..."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Tommy Cheung said that the increase was a gift from Beijing ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also urged the government to keep lobbying for allowance increases and an expansion of the multiple-entry limits for mainland visitors.

 The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board, Ng Yut-ming, has resigned amid a government plan to reform the statutory body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the board's website, Ng's tenure in office ended on Friday, following the earlier departure of six other members: Toby Ho, Grace Wong, Chan Kwok-bong, Adino Chung, Phyllis Luk and Lam Chiu-wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means only one elected member, Oscar Lai, remains on the board. The three-year term for the current board is set to expire in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to start the second reading of a government bill aimed at revamping the body next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill proposes increasing the number of appointed members from six to 17, while elected members will remain unchanged at eight.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Saturday said the government will adjust fees for Accident and Emergency departments, based on factors such as public affordability and social acceptance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, he said the financial burden on patients suffering from major illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease, could be huge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo told reporters that officials are mulling a cap on medical fees paid by severely ill patients and increasing subsidies for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Considering the major illnesses, a very common example these days will be patients with cancer. It's actually a major burden for the patient and for the family as well. Because with the advance in healthcare, especially in cancer treatment, some of these medications can be very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though most of us believe that we are healthy and want ourselves to be healthy... One day we may have a major illness like cancer or a stroke and we want to ensure that the current healthcare system in Hong Kong can provide a safety net for these people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lo said an independent committee set up by the Hospital Authority (HA) to review a spate of medical blunders comprises members from various backgrounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister said the list of committee members, which includes patient organisations, people with experience in managing medical systems and handling medical equipment, will be announced shortly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has ordered a comprehensive and systemic review at the HA after a series of medical incidents and issues with equipment at public hospitals.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The departure of more members from a social worker regulator would not affect its operation, according to Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, after six of them had left amid a looming reform of the statutory body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Social Workers Registration Board's website, Toby Ho and Grace Wong's terms ended on Thursday. Four others - Chan Kwok-bong, Adino Chung, Phyllis Luk and Lam Chiu-wan - also left earlier this month, leaving only two elected members behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I noticed that several elected members chose to resign. This was their own decision," the labour chief told reporters on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new amendment bill is very clear. Even if members resign, it will not affect the board's operation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development came as lawmakers are set to start a second reading of a government bill aimed at revamping the regulator. It proposes increasing the number of appointed members from six to 17, while elected members will remain unchanged at eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new body can also promptly disqualify social workers convicted of serious offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the Legislative Council passes the amendment bill on July 3, we plan to gazette it on July 5 and the old registration board will then cease to operate," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sector, society, and the government all hope that it can be a seamless transition. To do that, we need to appoint members to the board as soon as the bill is gazetted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also defended the administration's decision to inform board members in advance that they have to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR on July 5, describing it as a "responsible" move.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday warned of potential traffic jams at boundary checkpoints near the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, as scores of travellers are expected to head north for the July 1 long weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently SAR motorists planning to travel to Macau or Zhuhai must make reservations in advance. All northbound slots for Saturday have been snapped up, while limited places are available for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have been urged to address bottlenecks near the Zhuhai checkpoint, after travellers heading back to the SAR were stuck for hours on Tuen Mun Festival earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it has installed cameras so that people can check out the traffic condition at the Hong Kong port's vehicle clearance plaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It anticipates northbound traffic to peak on Saturday, while most will return on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The department will closely monitor the traffic conditions at all ports, and strengthen the dissemination of the latest traffic information to citizens who use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to travel between the three places," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Motorists have been urged to plan their return trip ahead, and travel in off-peak hours "as far as possible".

    Mixed reactions to increase in duty-free allowance

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some mainland tourists say they hope the duty-free allowance can be increased further. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759482_1_20240628175924.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There have been mixed reactions to an increase in the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau, with some welcoming the move and others saying it doesn't go far enough.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Beijing announced that it will increase the allowance from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Tsim Sha Tsui, a mainland tourist said he hopes to see the allowance increased further because he normally spends around 100,000 yuan in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope it can be raised to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, because women’s bags usually cost around that. Also, large jewellery and cosmetics items almost always cost more than ten thousand dollars," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Central, a visitor from Shenzhen said he will spend more in the SAR after the measure takes effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the original limit of 5,000 yuan is not enough because many electronic products cost more than 5,000 yuan... This adjustment will greatly stimulate mainland consumers' purchasing power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shanghai tourist said the increase won't make a difference to him, because he's only in Hong Kong to watch a concert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't really affect me because I don't buy much in Hong Kong. And now prices in Hong Kong are probably similar to the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Retail Management Association said the measure is an important step forward and it hopes the SAR government will continue to pay attention to the needs and development of the industry.

 A new promenade was opened in Kennedy Town on Friday, with officials touting it as an excellent area for people to take photos of Victoria Harbour and the Tsing Ma Bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony, Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said the 280-metre-long promenade connecting Cadogan Street and Sai Ning Street provides more space for events, and will attract visitors to the neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that this new promenade will become an excellent resting place where everyone can come to the seaside for walks and picnics with family and friends. Organisers can also hold various youth activities, exhibitions and markets here to make the atmosphere more harmonious and to make the economy more prosperous in the coming days," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Central and Western District Office will also utilise the space to hold more activities to add life and vitality to the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said the Cadogan Street Promenade will be accessible 24 hours a day and is equipped with shaded seating areas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official has reiterated the central government's commitment to maintaining the "One Country, Two Systems" governing principle for Hong Kong, while urging the city to capitalise on its unique advantages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, the director of Beijing's liaison office, on Friday described the territory's prosperity and stability as "rock solid", and said the rule of law, business environment, as well as democracy and freedom in the SAR, remain unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Shortly after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration 40 years ago, British-Hong Kong authorities unilaterally made changes to many of their promises. The last governor, Chris Patten, arbitrarily laid 'political landmines' for Hong Kong," Zheng told a Legislative Council luncheon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the central government's commitment has never changed, and it has offered extreme care for Hong Kong.".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told lawmakers that the city has "risen from the ashes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The central government fully supports Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is rapidly advancing from stability to prosperity. The biggest change is that Hong Kong has transformed from a humiliating colony run by outsiders to the apple of the country's eye," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong serves as the bridge for the world to understand China, enter China, and shake hands with China... [Integrating into the country] will not marginalise Hong Kong, or even 'mainlandise' the city. Instead, it will further strengthen Hong Kong's status and advantages, and have better achievements."

    'Higher duty-free limit will boost HK retail'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Politicians and industry representatives on Friday welcomed Beijing's move to raise the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities announced that the limit will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, told reporters that the move will boost the city's retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that with this initiative, tourists from the mainland can shop more freely and it can benefit our various industries, especially the retail industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that local authorities have to do their part to make the SAR a more attractive place for tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the two sessions in Beijing in March, delegates to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) signed a petition asking for the duty-free allowance to be increased to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, a CPPCC Standing Committee member, said the increase announced is a "good beginning", even though it's lower than the amount proposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This arrangement is exclusive. This arrangement is fair to both parties, and this arrangement can be adjusted going forward. And at the same time, it will be a boost to our retail industry and to our tourism industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation also welcomed Beijing's move, adding that the SAR government can work with malls to promote Hong Kong as a "shopping paradise".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, said it will hand out 500,000 sets of offers worth more than HK$100 million to overnight visitors to Hong Kong starting from July 11, including sightseeing, transport, dining and consumption discounts.

    Investment vehicle has its own unique functions: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city's government-owned investment vehicle aims to forge a more competitive tech-innovation ecosystem in the SAR, as he highlighted its differences with Singapore's sovereign investment arm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has been considered by some as a local version of Temasek in Singapore, Chan said the two bodies are “completely different” in an interview marking two years of the current administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s like comparing apples and oranges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two goals of the HKIC are to generate appropriate financial returns, and to help boost the innovation and technology industries and create a local ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Other than conducting its own investments, a more important [function of the firm] is that it will serve as a guide for other long-term and sovereign wealth funds and to invest in certain sectors together... to create a domino effect and attract HK$100 billion, or HK$200 billion or even HK$300 billion,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the government investment vehicle, which was set up two years ago and manages some HK$62 billion in assets, is still operating at an initial stage with only two deals signed so far, and authorities will reveal more details regarding projects with the release of its yearly report later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKIC signed deals with tech firms SmartMore and BioMap InnoHub earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the local property market, Chan said it remains stable despite a drop in prices in May, snapping a two-month increase following the removal of all cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid fluctuations in the residential property prices because they're affected by multiple factors, including interest rates as well as supply and demand. They're also affected by how people perceive the outlook of the property market and the city’s economic situation, job market, etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe the most important thing for the government is to maintain a healthy development of the property market, in other words, not to have major fluctuations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary added the government will keep ramping up land supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also expressed confidence towards the SAR economy in the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the economy was in its recovery stage in the first six months of 2024 and was still facing challenges, a series of mega events in the next six months will further boost local economic activity.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced that the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People who buy goods at duty-free stores at border crossings will continue to get an extra allowance of 3,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The change will take effect on July 1 at Lo Wu, Futian, Shenzhen Bay, West Kowloon Station, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Gongbei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The policy will be implemented at all border crossings from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the new arrangements would raise local spending by HK$8.8 billion to HK$17.6 billion and generate added value of about HK$2.7 billion to HK$5.4 billion to the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee welcomed the move, saying it shows the central government's support for Hong Kong's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new measure will enhance the shopping experience for mainland resident visitors in Hong Kong and allow them greater flexibility when shopping, which is beneficial for Hong Kong in attracting more visitors and boosting the development of diversified tourism," he said.

    Hong Kong condemns Taiwan over travel warning

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A government spokesman said the travel warning issued by Taiwan is a "despicable manoeuvre" to smear the city's national security law. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759404_1_20240628101154.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has condemned Taiwan for issuing a travel alert for Hong Kong, saying the island had smeared the city and its national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said the issuing of an "orange" alert by the Taiwan authorities warning residents against travelling to the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau was a “political manoeuvre with fact-twisting smears and slanders exposing malicious intentions.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan had said the alert -- its second highest – was needed because the risk of travelling to Hong Kong had risen following the implementation of the National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR government spokesman countered that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty – just like it is in many common law jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Taiwan authorities turned a blind eye to the fact, made exaggerated remarks, maliciously smeared and demonised the NSL and the SNSO, completely unmasking its double standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that ordinary travellers – including those from Taiwan --  would not unwittingly violate the law, noting that national security offences target only an extremely small minority who endanger national security and the safety of Hong Kong.

    HA chair upset about lengthy drug prescription

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hospital Authority (HA), Henry Fan, said on Thursday that he finds it unacceptable that a public hospital doctor recently prescribed more than 400 days' worth of psychiatric medication to a patient.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eastern Hospital earlier said that it is undesirable for patients to be given medicine for a long period of time, after a private doctor wrote about the case of the psychiatric patient on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital said the patient, who had been seeing a private doctor, was admitted in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before being discharged, a doctor prescribed him the medication to make sure he would have a sufficient supply should he postpone future appointments, the hospital said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the HA's board meeting, Fan said the matter will be subject to a review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this case, as you all know, right now the clinical decisions must be made by the doctor on duty. So our review is not necessarily to hold someone accountable or something," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But rather, we want to give more guidelines to doctors, for them to know what to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan noted there is also an ongoing review looking at prescribing patients at outpatient clinics with no more than 16 weeks' worth of drugs, saying officials will consider this latest case together with that review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the government ordered a comprehensive, systemic review at the HA, following a spate of medical blunders and issues with equipment at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan said the authority has shortlisted several people with no links to the authority to form an independent committee for the review.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said retail sales will improve, although challenges remain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony for the Hong Kong Shopping Festival, Chan cited changes in consumption patterns of tourists and local residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the consumption patterns of the public and visitors have changed this year, the retail industry faces many challenges," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The good news is that the job market is still doing quite well, and there's still spending demand. As long as we change our approach, adjust our positioning, update strategies, link up with new demand and create consumption trigger points, business will certainly come back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, Annie Yau Tse, said the retail sector is hosting the shopping festival between July 1 and August 31 to boost sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this programme is going to help, at least bringing up the atmosphere to encourage our consumers to go to our retail shops to make purchases," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau Tse added that more than 5,000 retailers will take part in the festival, offering freebies and concessions worth HK$1.2 billion.

    Prolonged hot spell set to break records

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hot spell which has scorched Hong Kong for a week will likely continue into the weekend, potentially breaking the record for the city's longest heatwave since a warning system was introduced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The observatory said on Thursday that under the influence of a subtropical ridge, it will remain very hot on Friday and Saturday, with a high of 35 degrees Celsius or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means the Very Hot Weather Warning, which has been in place since last Thursday, could be extended for another two days or longer. The warning is issued when the temperature hits 33 degrees or higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current heatwave record was set in 2016, when the warning was in force for nine consecutive days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting assistant director at the observatory Cheng Yuen-chung warned the worst could be yet to come, as July is usually the SAR's hottest month of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said that people should brace for hotter summers than in previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the background of global warming, we expect the temperature in the summer to rise compared to the past," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The general public should take extra precautions against heatstroke."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association, meanwhile, urged elderly people to take hot weather warnings seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Elderly people] are particularly vulnerable to hot weather. If you have symptoms ... like dizziness, nausea, extreme tiredness or a feeling of dehydration, please rest and seek help immediately," said the association's Chief Executive Officer, Maura Wong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at the University of Hong Kong on Thursday said they have created a model that has the potential to speed up the development of anti-ageing products and drugs to combat age-related diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One of the researchers, Dr Cherie Lee, said that as Hong Kong's population ages, the need for age-related medical care will also increase, leading to an urgent need for research into anti-ageing methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past, studies of the ageing process have had to rely on either animal ageing models or cell lines, neither of which are accurate due to differences in human physiology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The research team, led by Professor of Biomedical Sciences Liu Pengtao, says it has developed a new cellular system that can be used to rapidly discover anti-ageing molecules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say this will enable researchers to understand the mechanisms of ageing in a controlled environment and to accurately observe the key features of ageing, thereby improving human health and longevity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu said this can not only open the door to further research, such as the discovery of ageing molecules or clinical research, but also to the development of drugs for age-related diseases.

 The government has announced the postponement of a joint co-operation conference between Hong Kong and Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The one-day meeting, which Chief Executive John Lee was expected to attend in Guangzhou, was originally scheduled to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 24th Plenary of the Hong Kong/Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference originally scheduled to take place in Guangzhou today (June 27) will be postponed to July as agreed by both the Guangdong and Hong Kong sides. The official date will be announced in due course," a government statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No reason was given for the postponement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee was planning to lead a government delegation to the mainland city and co-chair the plenary with the governor of Guangdong, Wang Weizhong, to discuss enhanced co-operation in areas such as innovation and technology, finance, healthcare, cross-boundary transport and trade.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung says the government aims to establish a regulatory framework for online ride-hailing platforms within the next three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Ming Pao newspaper, Lam said that next month the authorities will outline the legal responsibilities that such platforms must meet to obtain a licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam expressed confidence that the government will resolve complaints about such services from the taxi sector within its current term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transport minister also said the government will reduce tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of it in May next year. Currently, the fee for private cars is HK$58.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said it's hoped that lower tolls at the tunnel will divert traffic from the congested Tuen Mun Road and Tolo Highway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lam said the government will consider building a fourth cross-harbour tunnel when planning the construction of the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands. The islands, off Lantau, are expected to be completed by 2034.

    HK can guard against cyberattacks: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The innovation and technology chief has reassured the public that Hong Kong has the capacity to handle cybersecurity threats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Dong was speaking after a string of recent ransomware attacks on government departments and public bodies, with some leading to data leaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking two years of the current administration, Sun said government bureaus and departments will be asked to conduct regular inspection to guard against hackers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for innovation, technology and industry also noted that the problem was not confined to the SAR, but a global one as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of cyberattacks has been trending upwards. Judging from the data, the attacks are mainly from outside Hong Kong," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, this is also a global trend, so we must strengthen our monitoring work in this regard. Generally speaking, Hong Kong's cybersecurity is still under control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said the administration is dedicated to building an "international data park" in the Northern Metropolis, with consultations under way on the development at Sandy Ridge near Lo Wu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are already two hectares of levelled land, which would be released for use. On top of this two-hectare site, we are considering providing more opportunities to the industry, for example in the surrounding hillsides and slopes we can provide about more than 10 hectares of land," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Developers have until the end of July to express their interest before authorities make the plots available through means other than tendering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also expressed confidence that the SAR will continue to contribute to the country's space endeavours, thanks to its pool of talent in aerospace, after the selection of a Hong Kong resident as a payload specialist in the national space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the minister commented on a recent Legislative Council panel meeting during which he became visibly emotional while thanking lawmakers for their support for the government's innovation and technology initiatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lawmakers always ask tough questions, but in the end, everyone gave their full support. I was moved by the Legislative Council's unconditional support, not just to me but also to the entire development of innovation and technology," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So in the end, I got a bit emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said many people had questions about innovation and technology two years ago, but through government efforts, there's now a consensus in society on the issue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The police said they have arrested a man suspected of trying to kill his wife and three daughters by burning charcoal at a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspect was detained at a guesthouse in Mong Kok on Wednesday evening and is accused of attempted murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours earlier, officers received a report from the man's wife saying that she and the three girls, aged between 13 and 16, were feeling dizzy due to smoke in a flat in Shan King Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were taken to hospital and are said to be in satisfactory condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they suspect the woman's husband left the flat after setting the charcoal alight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a press briefing, Sum Ho-min, chief crime inspector of Tuen Mun division, said officers believe the suspect was having financial problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the Social Welfare Department will follow up on the case.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said they have seized more than 60,000 sports items, including footballs, jerseys and footwear, during a three-week operation combating counterfeit goods.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hauls, worth more than HK$50 million in total, led to the arrests of nine people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting head of customs' intellectual property investigation bureau, Peggy Tam, said the market was flooded with merchandise in the run-up to international sports events such as the Paris Olympics, and criminals made use of this to push out their counterfeit goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam urged people to only buy products from shops with a good reputation, warning that counterfeit items sold online are often of poor quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisional commander So Kim-fai from the bureau said people buying sports jerseys should pay attention to various details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly, the material used for counterfeit jerseys is not breathable. Secondly, some hang tags of counterfeit jerseys do not have a laser tag. Thirdly, the embroidery on counterfeit jerseys is cruder, with blurrier text. The embroidery on genuine jerseys is much clearer and more sophisticated," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some genuine jerseys also feature special designs on, for example, the sleeves, that counterfeit jerseys don't have."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Tang says there is no plan to extend the MTR East Rail Line into the Luohu district of Shenzhen. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759119_1_20240626160129.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong official on Wednesday scotched rumours that the East Rail Line will be extended into Shenzhen, with a "co-location" immigration clearance arrangement put in place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media reports earlier this year cited a mainland official as saying such a plan could be on the cards, as the Shenzhen side of the Lo Wu crossing is being redeveloped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But asked about the reports in Legco, Security Secretary Chris Tang said there is no plan to extend the MTR line into the Luohu district of Shenzhen, or bring in a co-location arrangement like the one in place for high-speed rail passengers at West Kowloon Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the government understands that Shenzhen authorities will soon carry out modification works on their side of the border crossing to "eliminate safety hazards, improve the port's functions, and upgrade the inspection facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the work to be carried out will not change the overall layout of the facilities and once completed, the time for immigration clearance on the Hong Kong side will not be affected.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Wednesday said a series of measures by the Hospital Authority (HA) to train and retain medical staff has been successful, with more doctors serving in the public sector and a drop in the resignation rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in the Legislative Council, Lo said the number of doctors increased by 260 in the 2023-24 year compared to the year before, while the resignation rate dropped to 5.2 percent, from 8.1 percent in 2021-22.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also told lawmakers that the hiring of medical practitioners from outside Hong Kong is going well, with 144 non-locally trained doctors working for the authority as of the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our estimation, because of our enhanced efforts to recruit non-locally trained doctors, by the end of this year we expect 250 non-locally trained doctors joining the HA to alleviate the burden on the public healthcare system," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the government announced a new batch of recognised medical qualifications under the Medical Registration Ordinance, involving 28 courses at 20 non-local universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four of the universities are on the mainland – Capital Medical University, Fudan University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Sun Yat-sen University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The others are in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the ordinance, non-locally trained doctors who have a recognised medical qualification can apply for special registration to practise in Hong Kong.

    New 3D scanners to speed up airport luggage checks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some people flying out of Hong Kong won't need to take out their electronic devices and liquids during security checks from July 2, as new CT X-ray machines are introduced at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new machines to check luggage will first be used at four of the 35 security screening lanes for departures from Terminal 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “By using a CT X-ray machine it can provide a 3D image to the screener. With the 3D image, the screener can help [security personnel] to make a better and quicker decision on whether the screened package is okay to pass through the screening process,” said executive director of airport operations Steven Yiu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can increase the hourly throughput from the current 240 to 360 [people]. So this is almost a 50 percent increase in capacity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New full-body scanners will also be introduced in the lanes with the new CT X-ray machines, for those who set off the metal detectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Normally, we require the passenger to go through the metal detector. When he/she triggers the alarm, the security operator will use the hand-held screener to do a second-tier check,” Yiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now, we'll replace it with a full-body scanner, reducing the contact between the person and our security officer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said they will gradually replace all the older X-ray machines and install the new full-body scanners in all security lanes in Terminal 1 departures as well as in transit areas, as part of a project costing more than HK$800 million.

    Over 2,000 restaurants to offer July 1 discounts

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 2,000 food outlets and stores across Hong Kong will offer discounts to celebrate July 1, with a lawmaker stressing that the concessions are not aimed at boosting business.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 29 percent discount will apply to designated menu items under the initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shops that have agreed to take part include convenience stores and major chains like Maxim's, Cafe de Coral and Tai Hing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not doing this to increase our sales. This is part of a celebration," said catering sector lawmaker Tommy Chueng on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is not how much business we do. It is contributing so that everybody will be happy come July 1 when you go out to eat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawmaker also said that asking eateries to give an across-the-board discount would discourage them from offering cheaper food and drink items.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to take 29 percent off your bill and be able to pay rent, your salaries and all your food costs," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, chairman of the Quality Tourism Services Association, said the discounts are coming at a good time, because more mainland residents are now able to travel to the SAR through the Individual Visit Scheme.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health chief Lo Chung-mau says that around 60 percent of patients who seek accident and emergency services at public hospitals are classified as semi- or non-urgent cases. Photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759084_1_20240626123001.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau says an ongoing review of accident and emergency charges at public hospitals is looking at how to focus resources on those patients who are most in need.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan suggested in January that the fees for various public services should be increased to offset the government's deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said about 60 percent, or 1.3 million, A&E visits each year are classified as semi-urgent or non-urgent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With each patient costing HK$2,400 on average, that means the government is spending HK$2 billion annually on patients who do not have a genuine need for emergency services, the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The money spent at public hospitals is funded by taxpayers, so we need to make sure it is used prudently," Lo told reporters in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I need to point out that the government is currently subsidising almost 97 percent of costs at public hospitals. That means users are paying less than four percent of the actual bill for their services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo emphasised that the government will not scale back healthcare funding, and said some patients may enjoy reduced fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities are also identifying groups who require more financial resistance, such as cancer patients who fork out hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for medication, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, Lo pledged to conduct a "systemic" review after a string of medical incidents at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He floated some possible solutions, including strengthening an incentive and penalty mechanism for staff, and boosting accountability among management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Having someone step down does not mean the problem is solved," he said, adding that resignations could further exacerbate the manpower shortage at public hospitals.

    Home prices fall 1.2 percent in May

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell by 1.2 percent in May, according to official data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drop followed two consecutive months of increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices in May were 12.7 percent lower than the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed a one percent increase in rental prices, which reached a four-and-a-half year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the first time home prices have reported a decrease since Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, the director of real estate consultancy Knight Frank, said the effects of the end of the "spicy" measures have now worn off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There seems to be no positive factors apart from the cooling measures news. Because currently the home prices are still being impacted by two negative factors," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first one is the high interest rate environment and the second one is the ample supply for new units. As long as these two factors continue to impact the market, it will stop the home prices from rebounding quickly."

    New law to boost infrastructure cybersecurity mooted

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Secretary for Security Chris Tang says the proposed legislative framework does not target individuals but large organisations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759011_1_20240625212402.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday proposed new legislation to enhance cybersecurity of critical infrastructures such as banks, railway systems and electricity suppliers, with operators required to report cybersecurity incidents and those who fail to comply fined up to HK$5 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a paper submitted to the Legislative Council by the Security Bureau, critical infrastructures are "facilities that are necessary for the maintenance of normal functioning of the Hong Kong society".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two major categories of critical infrastructures. The first covers facilities delivering "essential services" in eight sectors, namely energy, information technology, banking and financial services, land transport, air transport, maritime, healthcare services, as well as communications and broadcasting. The second includes "other infrastructures for maintaining important societal and economic activities", such as major sports and performance venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A new commissioner's office under the Security Bureau will be set up to monitor operators and follow up on non-compliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed legislative framework, operators are required to set up a computer system security management unit, conduct a security risk assessment at least once every year and an independent security audit at least once every two years, and report serious security incidents within two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penalties ranging from HK$500,000 to HK$5 million will apply to organisations that fail to comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang said the proposal does not target individuals but large organisations, adding that it will not infringe people's freedom to use the internet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers will discuss the proposal in a security panel meeting on July 2, followed by a consultation period that will last for a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it hopes to table the bill to Legco by the end of this year.
