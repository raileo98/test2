 Radio Television Hong Kong has won an Asia-Pacific broadcasting award.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were over 100 entries from 30 countries and regions across the Asia-Pacific at this year’s Together for Planet, People, and Peace Media Awards, which was organised by the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition was divided into video and audio categories, with a focus on people, peace and the planet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK Radio 5’s programme “It’s a Happy Day” won the radio award for the “Peace” category on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show’s aim was to help people deal with stress and negative emotions during the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each of the programme’s 365 episodes was about a minute long and packed with information listeners could use to improve their mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a news feature report by RTHK’s Chinese News and Current Affairs team was also nominated for a radio award under the “Planet” category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news team interviewed Mok Ho-kwong, who is also known as “Wild Man” for his philosophy on the environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare secretary Chris Sun on Thursday said the elderly can showcase their talents through performing arts, as Hong Kong prepares to host its first festival to celebrate elderly artists.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came as more than 100 performers aged up to 86 are set to take the stage at the "First Hong Kong Creative Ageing Arts Festival" next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also noted that Hong Kong's population is ageing, and urged all sectors to join hands and create an elderly-friendly culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 20 years time, every one in three people in Hong Kong will be aged 65 or above. We need to encourage more elderly to actively participate in society," Sun told an event to promote the festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope our creative ageing artists can showcase their abilities and skills to the community," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event will feature more than 30 programmes including dance performances and art exhibitions starting from September 25 to October 6 at the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Lo Wai-fung was unable to beat the reigning Olympic champion Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the men’s Taekwondo -68kg category at the Paris Olympic Games on Thursday, but the SAR athlete may still have a chance for repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Rashitov started off strong, beating Lo 12-0 in the first round with a series of kicks and punches. The Uzbek continued his lead into the second round, and while the 17th seeded SAR athlete was able to earn two points for a body kick, Rashitov ultimately came out victorious with a 9-2 win to reach the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, this may not be the end to Lo’s Olympic journey as rules indicate that anyone who has lost to a finalist in the single elimination competition enters the repechage, meaning if Rashitov ends up being a finalist, Lo has a chance at bronze in a repechage.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 75 prisoners have graduated from the Correctional Services Department's Ethics College, receiving diplomas in education.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Among the graduates was Tong Ying-kit, the first person charged under the National Security Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the graduation ceremony on Thursday, Tong reflected on his past, saying that he had been influenced by radical comments, misinformation and the social atmosphere at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was grateful for the education opportunities given to him, and expressed his desire to make positive contributions to society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang, who attended the ceremony, congratulated the graduates and said he was proud of their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised the role of the college in guiding them towards a more constructive path in life and instilling in them the importance of upholding ethical values.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the event, Tang praised the achievements of Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong and expressed regret that some people targeted and criticised her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kong is supportive of the government and she condemns violence. I think the stance should be encouraged, and everyone should embrace that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong won gold in the individual epee event at the Paris Olympic Games and is joining the Hong Kong Jockey Club as an assistant external relations manager.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group on Thursday said the sale of illegal cigarettes is becoming a more serious problem in Hong Kong, with free trial packets even handed out in the streets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group warned that such cigarettes could be harmful to health, because it's not clear what ingredients they contain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui Yuen, a member of the group, said he now sees promotional teams handing out free trial packets of illegal cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I run into them once or twice in Kwun Tong every week, there are no regulations! Where is the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Convener of the group Joe Lo said these promotional squads also encourage people to keep in contact with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Smokers are also invited to join the Telegram group to receive more promotional advertisements and to keep in contact," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also warned against a plan by the government to ban fruit-flavoured cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said a recent survey it carried out involving 297 people who smoked fruit-flavoured cigarettes found that two thirds would try to find illicit products if a ban came into effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Lo Wai-fung is heading into the round of 16 in the men’s Taekwondo -68kg category at the Paris Olympic Games, after beating Yahya Al Ghotany of the Refugee Olympic Team in straight sets at the Grand Palais on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo began the first round of the qualification contest with a clean 14-0 sweep, earning nine points in the first minute for three head kicks. He then got two points for a body kick, followed by a three-point head kick to end round one with less than 20 seconds to spare. A round ends automatically if one contestant is ahead by 12 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al Ghotany fought back with a two-point kick to the body at the start of the second round, but Lo came back strong, leading to an intense exchange of blows in the first 30 seconds. The SAR athlete was able to continue with strong kicks to the head to once again pull away by 12 points, and won 16-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo will face Uzbekistan’s Ulugbek Rashitov next for a place in the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time a Hong Kong, China athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they had foiled an attempt to smuggle 12 kilogrammes of gold, estimated to be worth HK$7.5 million, from Hong Kong to Japan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said an X-ray scan at the airport revealed gold hidden in parts of ozone generators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they suspect smugglers were trying to evade taxes of HK$800,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the third haul of smuggled gold to be intercepted by the authorities this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Society for Community Organization (SoCo) on Thursday called on the government to improve support for caregivers after a mother and son were found dead in their Kwun Tong flat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It's understood that the 60-year-old man died from an accident in the flat, while the 82-year-old bedridden woman died from a lack of care.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Yuen, a community organiser with Soco, said there is a lack of effort to identify high-risk families and inadequate emergency and temporary care support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said many carers do not know where to access support services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen stressed the need for proactive measures to support carers, noting that some older people with chronic illnesses are themselves forced to care for those even more vulnerable than themselves.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lo Wai-fung will be competing in the qualification contest on Thursday at 3pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Being the first to do something is never easy, especially when you have the weight of an entire city on your shoulders, and Lo Wai-fung is going to do just that on Thursday with his Olympic Taekwondo debut at the age of 21.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo will be competing in the men’s under 68kg qualification contest at the Paris Olympics. This is the first time a Hong Kong, China athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am the first one. I am going into competition with the weight of over 100,000 Taekwondo enthusiasts in Hong Kong, so it's a mission. They all support me, whether they watch the competition on television or live. Their support is my motivation so I am very thankful for them,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since obtaining his spot at the Paris Games in May, the Taekwondo athlete has undergone training at camps overseas. Lo also watched the first day of Taekwondo action on Wednesday to observe the referees in preparation for his own match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When I first stepped into the competition venue, I was very excited but also nervous. I'm excited because I get to compete in the world’s largest sporting event. I'm also nervous because I’ve never competed in such a large-scale competition before,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There's a lot of pressure with so many spectators watching me, but I will turn that into my motivation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo will first take on Yahya Al Ghotany of the Refugee Olympic Team in a qualification contest at 3pm Hong Kong time on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’ve never competed against the Refugee Olympic Team representative before, but I’ve watched him fight in YouTube videos, and he is always prepared in how he combats and what technique to use when he competes. I’ve only ever watched him in videos, so I won’t know his actual speed and strength until I go up against him. I won’t underestimate him,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Lo beats Al Ghotany, he will once again face world number six Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. The Uzbek beat Lo at the same stage at the Hangzhou Asian Games, where he ended up taking gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew this opponent was famous at the time, so I didn’t think too much and just focused on combat. You need to give it your all when you step on the stage. Though I lost in the end, I did reflect on the competition,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I asked myself if the gap with this opponent was really that big. If I work harder, I wonder if I can lessen the gap now in competition, and even win.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Grand Palais has been transformed to host the Taekwondo events, after the historic venue hosted fencing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 About 40 percent of students taking part in this year's Joint University Programmes Admissions System (Jupas) on Wednesday received offers from local universities, a figure that's in line with previous years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 40,000 students joined the centralised admissions scheme, and more than 15,700 of them were given an offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong said it admitted four of the 10 top scorers in this year's Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam, as well as eight top athletes through the Top Athletes Direct Admission Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them is Chloe Pak, who holds the Hong Kong U18 and U20 records in 100m hurdles as well as the Hong Kong record in 4x200m relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pak will be studying medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People think that studying and training may not co-exist, but I definitely do not think this is an issue, because it really depends on the person and their attitude," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese University, meanwhile, admitted five top DSE scorers who will all be studying medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another top DSE scorer will pursue a degree in business at the University of Science and Technology.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge on Wednesday dismissed a carer's claim that a negative culture at the residential home she worked at led to her abusing at least 22 of the children there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu Wing-sin, 46, was one of 34 caregivers charged in connection with a spate of child abuse at the Children's Residential Home in Prince Edward three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pleaded guilty to 49 counts of abuse, with the District Court told she hit children with a shoe and kicked them in the head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as citing a negative culture at the home run by the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children, the defence said Chiu had been praised by parents and senior colleagues during her more than 20 years of experience in childcare and had suffered depression and suicidal thoughts following the abuse incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, judge Lily Wong rejected the mitigation plea and severely criticised Chiu for her actions, saying she "beat up the children every day she went to work".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge questioned why Chiu did not take action or resign from her position if she disagreed with the practices at the centre, instead of participating in the abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was adjourned until September 20 for sentencing.

 Dozens of people queued up on Wednesday to visit Hong Kong's new National Security Exhibition Gallery before it opened at 10am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Located on the second floor of the Hong Kong Museum of History, the gallery is the city's first thematic exhibition dedicated to promoting national security education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman at the front of the queue said that as a Chinese person, she should know more about national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She expressed concern about the limited sense of national identity among Hong Kong's youth compared with their mainland counterparts, and stressed the need for more education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A child accompanied by his grandmother said he wanted to explore issues beyond what he had learned at school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to learn more about Chinese history and law, which we did not learn much about in school," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1,100-square-metre gallery is divided into six different zones, including a theatre that shows a short video about modern Chinese history and emphasises the importance of national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has called for a wide range of visitors to the gallery.

    Cathay declares interim dividend despite profit drop

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765141_1_20240807130622.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Wednesday announced an interim dividend due to its strong performance in the first six months of 2024, despite reporting a drop in first-half profit from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm added that a decrease in profit for its airlines and subsidiaries was "principally attributable to the normalisation of ticket prices".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group recorded a 14 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our strong performance for the first six months of the year was primarily driven by the ongoing robust demand for travel, and the solid performance of our cargo business," said the airline's chairman Patrick Healy in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This result has allowed us to announce a first interim dividend payment to ordinary shareholders of HK$0.20 per ordinary share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay's budget arm, HK Express, reported a loss of HK$73 million in the first half of the year, following earnings of HK$333 million in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Lam said the low-cost carrier had been facing engine issues and regional competition, but he remained confident in the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of those aircraft are on ground and not being able to generate revenue for HK Express in the short term," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second issue HK Express is facing short-term, is the very keen competition among short-haul carriers based in Hong Kong, as well as the foreign low-cost carriers flying into Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Healy said the company is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic flight levels within the first quarter of 2025 as it enters "the final stretch" of its rebuilding journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are increasing our group headcount by 5,000 to a total of 29,000 people by the end of this year to support this pace of growth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline had also bought back HK$19.5 billion in preference shares acquired by the government as part of a bailout package to stay afloat, and said it would continue to maintain a lower level of liquidity than it did during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of its fleet, Cathay said it would buy 30 Airbus A330-900 wide-body aircraft, with an option to purchase 30 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not disclose the purchase price but said it received "significant price concessions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The basic price is about US$11 billion, or roughly HK$85.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These new regional wide-body aircraft are expected to be delivered from 2028 and will join the Cathay Pacific fleet, principally serving destinations in Asia. We now have more than 100 new-generation aircraft in our delivery pipeline, with the rights to acquire 80 additional aircraft in future," Healy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The purchase of Airbus aircraft is part of an investment drive of more than HK$100 billion over the next seven years, which also includes newly designed lounges and cabin products.

    Govt urged to prevent misuse of healthcare vouchers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Wednesday urged the government to ensure proper use of public funds as the city's healthcare voucher scheme for the elderly is further expanded to include more mainland medical institutions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong residents aged 65 and above receive HK$2,000 vouchers each year to spend on private healthcare services. From next Wednesday, these vouchers will be accepted at seven facilities in the Greater Bay Area, up from four at present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca Chan, chairwoman of Legco's health services panel, said during an RTHK programme that the government should act as a gatekeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There shouldn't be any possibility of reselling the vouchers or using them for other purposes, such as just buying [medical] products.... The government needs to act as a gatekeeper, perhaps through inspections. They should also look at how to deal with reports of illegal use," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Siu, who manages a mainland service provider covered by the voucher scheme, highlighted the growing trend of Hong Kong residents, especially the elderly, seeking medical services across the border. About one in five of his clients are from Hong Kong, a number he expects to increase after the scheme is further expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes the expansion could help ease the strain on Hong Kong's medical system, adding that his firm plans to hire more Cantonese-speaking staff to meet the growing demand.

    Rower thanks family support for strong finish in Paris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rower Chiu Hin-chun, a two-time SAR Olympian who made history with his performance at the Paris Games, said he wants to thank his family for supporting his career over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu was ranked 20th overall in Paris, the best result for himself and a male Hong Kong rower at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished fourth in his heat in the preliminary round at the Paris Games, and had to go through the repechage to advance to the next stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the heat, I keep asking myself if anything I can squeeze more to not get caught by the Hungarian athlete. And after that, I told myself I already gave my 100 percent in the heat so there's no regrets,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking on five Olympic races in just a week, Chiu said the biggest challenge was to recover both mentally and physically in a short period of time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have to think [about] how to recover, what else I have to eat so I can recover faster. In the middle of the race, I feel very tired and [have] to adjust my [mentality] to prepare for the next race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a lightweight rower competing in the open category, he admitted it’s not easy to take on Europeans who are larger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with a bright smile, the 29-year-old said family support kept him going until now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially like this time, they come to Paris and they have to walk through like the 2km courses from the start to the finish to the spectator stage to watch my race, and then go back to the start again, and to take the bus and go back to the hotel,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Normally people have their family trip [elsewhere], and our family trip is watching my race. So it is really special for us,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Formerly a windsurfer, Chiu found his place on the flat water because of the satisfaction it brought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In rowing, we have a quote, it’s ‘mileage makes champions’. So when I changed to rowing, I [was] very satisfied with my performance and also the achievements can keep pushing me to the other level,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who won a World Cup gold medal in Switzerland just before Paris, will fly to Canada next for the World Rowing Championships from August 18 to 25.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday urged Hongkongers planning to travel to the United Kingdom, or those who are already there, to be careful given the ongoing protests and riots there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber outbound travel alert – the lowest in a three-tier warning system – is currently in effect for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means there are signs of threat and people visiting should "monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation and asked any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or reach out to the Chinese Embassy in the UK.

    EOC calls for better public breastfeeding facilities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Tuesday called for improvements to public facilities for breastfeeding.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The body said a survey of 1,000 breastfeeding mothers found 81 percent were unhappy with the facilities available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Complaints included an insufficient number of babycare and lactation rooms, and small sizes and poor hygiene conditions when it comes to some of those that are available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The conditions of these facilities will directly affect whether women choose to breastfeed or express milk in public places, and may even become barriers to breastfeeding," said EOC Executive Director Ferrick Chu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 90 percent of the survey respondents said they thought shopping centres should provide more breastfeeding or expressing facilities, while over 80 percent thought commercial and government premises should improve the hygiene standards of their facilities, the EOC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission said the government should ensure an even distribution of breastfeeding facilities across different areas of the city and provide incentives for premises to establish and maintain high-quality facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Breastfeeding is not just a mother's responsibility, it also affects the growth and development of the next generation. All sectors of society have a duty to create a favourable environment for breastfeeding mothers," said EOC Chairwoman Linda Lam.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Tuesday called on Hong Kong's business sector to make proactive efforts to understand, respond and embrace changes, during a session studying a letter by President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a recent reply letter to Hong Kong entrepreneurs with family ties to Ningbo, Xi urged them to leverage their strengths and contribute to Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, was quoted as saying that society, especially the business sector, should take the president's words as a guide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, who heads Beijing's liaison office in the SAR, noted that the letter was not only an encouragement for the entrepreneurs, but also expressed Xi's high hopes for the entire business community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR should act as the protagonist, actively participating in the torrent of further comprehensively deepening reforms. It should not be a bystander, but be someone who's involved," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong should fully grasp areas that should be maintained and remain unchanged, areas that should be changed, and areas where it should take the lead in making a change."

 Citybus on Tuesday announced an across-the-board pay rise of 3.6 per cent for all employees.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bus company said that while the market environment remains challenging and it's facing strong inflationary pressures, it considers its workforce to be a very valuable asset.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citybus said that despite the difficult operating conditions, it has decided to offer a competitive pay increase to thank its staff for their dedication and to maintain good labour relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm said it made the decision after considering the views of its employees, adding that the pay rise for frontline staff will come into effect from September 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that in addition to 24 weeks of fully paid maternity leave and two weeks of fully paid paternity leave, it will introduce additional days off for staff whose children are getting married.

  <br/>
  The delegation is expected to be in the SAR from August 29 to 31, although it is unclear how many athletes will take part in the visit.

Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764954_1_20240806121207.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislator and Chinese medicine professor Chan Wing-kwong on Tuesday welcomed reports that the voluntary health insurance scheme will be extended to cover services at the city's first Chinese medicine hospital, saying it would be a significant step by the government to further recognise traditional Chinese medicine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nine-storey hospital in Tseung Kwan O is due to open next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Chan said both Chinese and Western medicine hospitals should be treated equally by insurance companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a hospital - whether it specialises in Chinese medicine or Western medicine - the cost of services is essentially the same. From hospital beds to nursing care and other essential services, the cost is comparable. Therefore, insurance companies should expand their coverage to include these healthcare services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, who is the general manager of China Taiping Insurance Company, said the industry needs to know more about what kind of medical services the new hospital will provide and how much it will charge before deciding on insurance premiums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By then, we will have more data to consider how to calculate premiums in the future if we want to extend the voluntary health insurance to cover traditional Chinese medicine services at the hospital," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An opening ceremony was held on Tuesday for Hong Kong's new National Security Exhibition Gallery, with Chief Executive John Lee calling for a wide range of visitors to the attraction.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gallery, at the Hong Kong Museum of History, will open to the public on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said he hopes various groups of people will visit, including groups from primary and secondary schools and youth organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised the crucial role of such visits in effectively promoting national security education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE stressed that safeguarding national security is a responsibility of the SAR government. He reiterated the government's commitment to accurately and fully upholding the One Country, Two Systems principle, while safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Safeguarding national security is always a work in progress. There is no completion. Given the ever-changing international situation, it is necessary to maintain a sense of crisis," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event, Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing's liaison office, described the gallery as a place to help citizens better understand national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The opening of the National Security Exhibition Gallery will further consolidate the consensus that security brings prosperity, and cultivate the grounds for safeguarding national security," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR star swimmer Siobhan Haughey has returned to Hong Kong after winning two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters at the airport that she needs to recharge her batteries before returning to training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to take a break first, and then I'll start training afterwards, because my next competition will be the World Cup in mid-October, so a short break just to process everything that happened and enjoy some down time," Haughey said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what she thinks about being the Hong Kong athlete with the most number of Olympic medals, Haughey said she is honoured to represent the city and bring glory to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I enjoyed this Olympics so much and I have done my best in the competition. The process is much more important than the outcome, I have no regrets," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said the atmosphere in Paris was much better than the Covid-era Tokyo 2021 Olympics as there was an audience in the arena this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My parents and fans can watch my competitions inside the venue... and there are people from Hong Kong everywhere. It feels like we are celebrating the Olympics together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The swimmer said she has no exact plans on how to spend her HK$3 million prize money, but wishes to do something to thank her team for supporting her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey also called for more resources to be allocated to swimming, to enable more young people to reach higher levels in the sport.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's table tennis team of Doo Hoi-kem, Lee Ho-ching and Zhu Chengzhu was unable to advance to the next stage of the women's team competition, losing 3-2 to Sweden in the round of 16.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first three matches between the teams went the distance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s Filippa Bergand and Christina Kallberg won the first two games in the first match 11-9, 11-5. The SAR pair of Doo and Lee made a strong comeback and won the next three games 11-9, 11-4 and 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhu Chengzhu took on Sweden’s Linda Bergstrom in the second match. After a tight back and forth, Bergstrom ultimately came out victorious to bring an overall tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo played against Kallberg in the third match and won the first two games 11-5, before losing the next three to the Sweden player 8-11 and 3-11 and 10-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fourth match, Zhu dominated the three games 11-8, 11-4 and 11-6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee lost 5-11, 6-11, and 10-12 in the final and decisive match against Bergstrom, bringing their Olympic journey to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo took responsibility for the loss, saying she let Kallberg back in the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel I share a bigger responsibility for the defeat because I dropped the third match, it's what led to a loss for the team," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, said she felt the team had no regrets because they had done their best.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added she had played Bergstrom before and had a tough time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the first two games against her [this time], it seems I couldn't really find good ways to make a breakthrough," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, when I found a way in the third game, it was too late. My in-game adjustments weren't bold enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR women’s table tennis team took home bronze in the Tokyo Games.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China sailor Nicholas Halliday has been eliminated from men’s dinghy competition, with two races cancelled on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The last races were scrapped due to a lack of wind in Marseille, meaning Halliday had no chance to make the top 10 to enter the medal race on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR sailor ranked 24th out of 43 participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday was on 136 net points, compared with 99 for Ireland’s Finn Lynch in 10th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday said it was a shame the races got cancelled because he was feeling good to go, but overall he was satisfied with his Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, but it was really exciting," he told RTHK in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I'm satisfied. I mean I gave it my all, I left no stones unturned, so I'm happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday added he's already setting his sights on qualifying for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.

 The MTR Corporation on Monday announced that services between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay will come to a close about two hours earlier than usual on October 26, to allow for track diversion work for the Tung Chung Line Extension.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The last train from Tung Chung will depart at 11.01pm, while the last train from Sunny Bay to Tung Chung will depart at 11.07pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The railway company said it will arrange free shuttle buses between the two stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services on the rest of the line will run as normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The construction of the Tung Chung Line Extension project commenced last year, with plans to add a new Tung Chung East Station between Tung Chung Station and Sunny Bay Station.

    'Increase in Covid cases not a cause for concern'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A government adviser says most people won't need to get a Covid booster shot again. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764819_1_20240805161830.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A government adviser on Covid suggested on Monday that the cost-effectiveness and coverage of Covid booster vaccinations should be assessed in the long term as infections become milder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases currently recommends a booster shot every six months for high-risk groups such as the over-50s and those with underlying health conditions. They can receive the booster free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's chairman, Professor Lau Yu-lung, said there has been a slight increase in Covid cases recently, but this is not a cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From a public health perspective, we really need some kind of a study to assess the cost-effectiveness... it might not be necessary to administer as in the past, the whole scale of approach for a lot of people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Recently, because of the upsurge of all the monitoring indices, as well as you can just learn from your friends and families who got infected, most of them are really very mild... Indeed every successive infection will be milder than the previous infection until you won't even notice it."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says hot weather led to increased electricity demand. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764812_1_20240805153704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday announced a mid-year net profit of HK$5.95 billion, a near 18 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company said Hong Kong’s accelerated economic recovery, along with hotter weather, led to increased electricity demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Australian and Indian business also improved, offsetting the impact of reduced electricity generation at its nuclear power plants on the mainland due to scheduled maintenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP also pointed to various renewable energy projects on the mainland, saying they will be the key drivers for its profit in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s revenue rose to HK$44.09 billion, an almost 2 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.63 per share, matching the first interim dividend of the year and unchanged from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have always been generating revenue and dividends for the benefit of our shareholders. And we adopt a policy to have a reliable and consistent dividend with steady growth supported by sustainable business development,” said CLP's chief executive officer TK Chiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we will continue to grow the business and if the condition approves, of course, we will try to adjust our dividend. But at the end of the day, the dividend will be approved by the board.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiang also said any further reduction in prices for consumers in the remainder of the year will depend on the international fuel market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because of the continued easing of the energy prices globally, we saw tariff reduction. From January up to August, the tariff for CLP's customers in Hong Kong saw a reduction of about 2 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the remaining part of the year, it will really depend on the international fuel price trend. If the fuel price continues to follow the current trend, there could be an opportunity for further adjustments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about progress in reviewing its power management system following several voltage dips this year, Chiang said the company is working on solutions to minimise the impact such incidents have on customers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested 119 people in a two-week anti-triad operation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they shut down five alleged vice establishments, seven suspected gambling dens, as well as a facility they believe was being used to manufacture illegal drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Inspector Thomas Anthony Lo said the force believes it also busted a syndicate that had scammed people selling luxury goods on social media by making purchases with fake banknotes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group would claim to help the victims inspect and authenticate the items they were selling. At the same time, the alleged scammers would use transparent, plastic bags that contained a pile of cash to district the victims. The victims would also be instructed to go to another room to give their signatures," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During this period, the syndicate would take the opportunity to take away the victims' valuables, leave the scene and never return."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said the victims, who lost HK$2 million between them, later realised that only the banknotes on the top and bottom of the stacks were real and the rest were counterfeit.

    Overcharged minibus passengers to get refunds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Passengers who were overcharged by the operator of four New Territories minibus routes can get a refund from Monday, transport authorities announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department earlier revealed that the green-top minibus routes operated by Fully Mint Limited – 501A, 501C, 501K and 501S – had been charging passengers more than the approved fares for over two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that from May 19 to July 26, the operator set fares between HK$0.3 and HK$1 higher than the permitted amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A department spokesperson on Monday said passengers affected can get the excess fare amounts back either in cash or via electronic payment methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As beneficiaries under the Government Public Transport Fare Concession Scheme for the Elderly and Eligible Persons with Disabilities were not affected by the overcharging incident, refund is not needed. The [green minibus] operator will reimburse the government for the overpaid subsidies under the scheme," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers who paid by Octopus can claim a refund via the mobile app or at an Octopus Service Point, while people who paid in cash can get their refund from the minibus operator at Wo Mun Street PLB Terminus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alipay and AlipayHK, for their part, said the overcharged fares have been refunded directly to users affected.

    Sprinter Felix Diu eyes new HK 100m record after Paris
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Felix Diu says he wants to set a new Hong Kong record in the men’s 100m sprint. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764679_2_20240804164357.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu, fresh from his Olympic debut in Paris, said he now wants to set a new SAR record in the men’s 100m.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Diu finished fourth in his heat at the Paris Games in 10.62 seconds, and said he was thrilled to have competed with the world's top runners at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s quite awesome, because we've seen a lot of world-class athletes here and it's a great experience to see such a huge venue here and a lot of people watching me compete in the competition,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old Olympic debutant was taking part despite a leg injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu entered the Paris Games through a wild card. Olympic qualification for the 100m sprint was 10 seconds, and his personal best is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprinter said his next goal is to break the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100m specialist noted that for the first time, the Olympic track is in purple, instead of red or blue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's made with recycled shells produced by the fishing industry, as part of efforts to promote sustainability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the track at the Stade de France is not completely rubber on the bottom but is filled with air cells of a geometric shape, to boost athletes’ performances and prevent injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the purple track is really making the athletes really comfortable to combat in and also the material they use is very bouncing, so it's really helpful for our performance,” Diu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu started training in secondary school because he enjoyed the excitement of sprinting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I just quite enjoy the process of training and competition. It brings me satisfaction and excitement,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And with the Los Angeles Games four years away, he said he will continue to improve his game and work hard as a full-time athlete.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kristen Faulkner of the United States rode her way to a shock gold medal in the women’s cycling road race on Sunday at the Paris Olympics, while Hong Kong, China's Ceci Lee completed the challenging 158-kilometre course just a few minutes behind the leaders.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American surprised crowds as she finished in a little under four hours, beating some of the world’s best for the Olympic victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marianne Vos of the Netherlands, who won this event in the London Olympics, took home silver, while Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky secured the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo of Vos and Blanka Vas of Hungary were leading the pack with just a little under four kilometres left of the gruelling race, before Faulkner and Kopoecky began to accelerate towards the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American ended up moving ahead of the leading group, finishing with a time of 3 hours, 59 minutes and 23 seconds near the beautiful Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vos, Kopecky and Vas completed in a photo finish, 58 seconds behind the champion, but Vas unfortunately was a smidge behind and missed the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee completed the course in a remarkable 4 hours, 10 minutes and 47 seconds, just around eleven minutes behind the gold medalist. The SAR athlete ranked 64th overall out of 92 cyclists, with 14 unable to complete the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said after the race she felt she was in good condition, and the course was more difficult than she expected with many steep climbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said while racing, she felt she had to toughen up so as not to waste the hard work the team and herself had put in in training. And she's glad she accomplished her goal of finishing the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather satisfied – because I just checked all the data, they were basically my best times," she told reporters. "So I would say it was a new level [of achievement]. So I hope I can build on this and perform even better in the upcoming race."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, 23, will be back in action on the track in the omnium on Sunday – the closing day of the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cyclists had to overcome 1,700 metres of climbing in nine ascents, passing by various landmarks in and around the host city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China sailor Nicholas Halliday on Sunday moved up one place in the men's dinghy after completing two more races at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Halliday came in 15th and 32nd place respectively on the fourth day of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old still has two more races to go on Monday, a day before the medal race in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is now ranked 24th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 136 net points, compared with 99 for Ireland’s Finn Lynch in 10th place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO has called for a shift in how people view “middle age”, proposing a new age range of 50 to 75 and the city’s retirement age be adjusted accordingly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A recent survey it conducted of more than 400 people found that 90 percent were confident about their health at the age of 65.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eighty percent believed they would be able to continue working after retirement and expressed a desire to remain engaged in some form of work, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dickey Tang from the group JCI City noted the "new middle age" concept was brought up by the United Nation in a 2019 report, saying as more people stay healthy and energetic in their 50s, there's a need to give middle age a new definition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We based upon the living age and the retiring age for Hong Kong citizens and we found that people aged 50 until 75 actually are still healthy, including mentally and physically," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And they found themselves capable of doing more work and to serve their cities instead of retiring like usual elderly people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we define that from 50 to 75 years old, that's the new middle age for Hong Kong citizens.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang suggested the city’s retirement age be delayed for 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said he believes it would take time for society to embrace the idea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The society, the commercial world, the people, and education is not quite following this topic. So the pushing of this policy and the people's beliefs is quite laid back and delayed,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the changes need to start with educating people that age 60 or 65 is not an automatic endpoint to their work life, while also stressed that businesses need to adjust their employment policies to allow people to stay in the workforce for longer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Sunday expressed concern about a rise in the number of cyclists killed in traffic accidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of fatalities in the first six months of 2024 stood at seven, up from two in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief inspector of Police Traffic Branch (Road Safety), Lam Kai-sum, described the increase as worrying, adding that six of the victims did not wear a helmet or any protective gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enforcement action can help to lower the fatal accident figures," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So our enforcement aim is to reduce the number of fatalities... (and) to change the irresponsible behaviour of road users."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, 51 people were killed in traffic accidents in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also said the number of those who died or were seriously injured dropped 42 percent to 392 from 675 a year ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sizzling temperatures did not prevent people from taking part in the annual Sport For All Day organised by the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) on Sunday opened most of its leisure facilities across 18 districts for free public use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People needed to book in advance through the LCSD mobile app to use facilities like badminton, tennis and basketball courts, while most public swimming pools were open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman, surnamed Shum, went swimming at a pool in Wong Tai Sin at 6.45am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the ongoing Olympics Games motivated her to exercise more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially for us seniors, a lack of exercise is not good for our health. Watching the Olympics makes us want to stretch our legs and arms a bit, which is beneficial for our health,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mother, surnamed Hui, said there was not enough promotion. She said her son could have played basketball if she had learnt about the free facilities earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there are more free sports facilities, then people can have better chances of participating; and promotion, especially online, can be enhanced,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, Secretary for Sports, Culture and Tourism Kevin Yeung and Acting LCSD Director Winnie Chui visited a sports carnival at a stadium in Tai Po in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carnival featured booths promoting various sports like 3-on-3 basketball and Kabaddi, a fast-paced tag game from India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the visit, Lee said he hoped the Sports For All Day would encourage people to support and participate in sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we exercise for 30 minutes every day, we will be happy, healthy and relaxed," he said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Transplant Sports Association is organising a sports day in October for people who have undergone organ transplant. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764671_1_20240804145710.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Transplant Sports Association said organ donors have decreased by 60 percent in the SAR compared to 10 years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Chau Ka-foon, founder and honorary chairperson of the association, said one of the reasons is because of Covid, during which not only the number of donors decreased due to deaths, but hospitals closed down and staff were infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau said in a survey that they carried out, many people indicated they're willing to donate their organs, but there are different reasons why they have not come forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not unwilling, they only ignore the necessity of organ donation, maybe they are not in contact with other patients who are in need, so they are not aware of their existence," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau added that Hong Kong people are very busy, and they don't go online and register as organ donors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association also said it will host a sports day for patients in October, as part of efforts to help with their recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One kidney inflammation patient, Peony Choi, is now a badminton athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One year before my kidney transplant, I had to stop all my work, I had to stay at home, just waiting. And you never know when you can have the kidney and at that time my strength was so weak I cannot do anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said playing badminton has helped her regain her strength after the organ transplant.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday unveiled plans to visit Europe, the United States, Australia and the Middle East, in the second half of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On his official blog, the finance minister said the visits aim to strengthen ties with traditional markets, as well as to explore new markets and capital sources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that Hong Kong has a strong international presence in finance, business, culture and people-to-people exchanges, making it a vital player in global trade and resilient in the face of challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said Hong Kong's overall economy remains relatively stable and continues to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He mentioned that key drivers of the economy like exports and investment spendings both continued to rise, supporting a 3.3 percent year-on-year economic growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But changes in tourist and consumer spending patterns, along with a strong Hong Kong dollar are bringing some pressure to private consumption, Chan added.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vivian Kong says she’s going to start a charity to help kids pursue sports. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764658_1_20240804101145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong has announced her retirement from professional fencing, bidding farewell to her career as a full-time athlete.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made history at the Paris Olympics Games, clinching the first ever gold medal in the individual epee event for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old’s résumé includes three Olympic appearances, two world championship bronze medals, as well as six Asian Games medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m so grateful to have had the chance to dedicate almost 20 years of my life to fencing and thank you for being a part of this journey,” she wrote in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After competing in my third Olympics, I have decided to take a break from professional fencing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she’s going to start a new career and launch her own charity to help kids find joy and playfulness in sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I will miss my fencing family so so much, but once a fencer, always a fencer,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, said Kong had informed him of her decision earlier, saying he understood it but was sad to hear the news.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe the decision was made after long-time consideration and family discussions. I wasn't surprised when she told me about the decision,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “She is such a high performance athlete who has just won an Olympic gold medal and is at the peak of her athletic career. This is something many athletes can only dream of… I’m really sad to see her go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng said that Kong’s departure will definitely have an impact on the fencing team, but added that he remains optimistic about the team's future development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patrick Yung, a surgeon who performed two knee operations on Kong, said he is behind the Olympic gold medallist's decision to hang up her sword.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong suffered serious anterior cruciate ligament injuries in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think those injuries suffered by Vivian over the past years did affect her decision for retirement or not," Yung, who chairs the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology at Chinese University, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But over the past few years, it's not just physical demands, [there's] also very high mental stress for a lot of Olympians representing Hong Kong. That's why I am not surprised to see not just Vivian, but even others, would like to take a break, [go on] holiday, or do something else, so that they can recover physically and mentally."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgium's Remco Evenepoel made history on Saturday in the men's cycling road race, though Hong Kong's Vincent Lau dropped out almost three-quarters of the way through one of the most gruelling of all Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel, who won the time trial a week earlier, became the first man to claim gold in both road cycling disciplines, despite having to swap bikes four kilometres from the finish because of a mechanical failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He took control 15 kilometres from the end of the 273km race around Paris and surrounding areas to cross the finish line near the Eiffel Tower one minute and 11 seconds ahead of Valentin Madouas of France. Another home athlete, Christophe Laporte, completed the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau pushed hard and cycled beyond the 200-kilometre mark, but he unfortunately couldn’t keep up with the peloton, becoming one of 13 participants who failed to complete the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was disappointed he could not reach the finishing line, but he was excited to have raced alongside some all-time greats of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Performance-wise, I think I could do better. But the experience, I think, it's the best you can get. A cycling race in France, it doesn't get bigger than this," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seeing all the fans on every climb, shouting 'allez, allez, allez', it's every cyclist's dream to have that crowd on a climb cheering you on. I think the experience is very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 90 cyclists in the pack had to overcome 2,800 metres of climbing on 13 ascents throughout the course, which passed many Parisian landmarks before winding into the French countryside.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR sailor Nicholas Halliday on Saturday improved his overall ranking in the men's dinghy, going up by three places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old completed two more races – coming in 6th place in the second one – on the third day of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday has four more races to go over the next two days in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is now ranked 25th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 89 net points, compared with 63 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China, women's swimmers on Saturday finished their 4x100 metres medley relay ranked 13th out of 14 teams, saying they all very much enjoyed their last race at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephanie Au, Siobhan Haughey, Natalie Kan and Karen Tam clocked a time of four minutes and 3.56 seconds, nearly two seconds short of the Hong Kong record the four hold, and more than a second slower than their Paris entry time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au, competing in her fifth Olympics, had a strong start, as she helped the team stay in the middle of the pack in the backstroke leg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when Haughey finished off her breaststroke leg, the SAR squad was among the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kan and Tam tried to catch up in butterfly and freestyle, but to no avail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They ended up being seventh in their heat, with Denmark being disqualified. Team Australia won the heat and were the fastest entering the finals, with Team China second in the heat and third overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au described their finishing time as less than ideal, but the swimmer said she was thankful for the experience because she had many family and friends in the stands cheering for her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said she was pleased with her overall performance in Paris, saying she very much enjoyed being with her fellow relay swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think when you evaluate a competition, you don't just look at the results because there are a lot of details behind it. You don't just determine [a competition] with the time and rank," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kan, making her Olympic debut, said while their time fell short of expectations, she had no regrets because she knew the whole team already did the best they could.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam said everyone enjoyed the experience and thanked the Hongkongers in the stands who travelled all the way to Paris to support them.

    HK sprinter Felix Diu unable to advance in 100m

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Felix Diu (C) was very close to advancing to the next round. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764597_2_20240803222636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu was on Saturday eliminated in the preliminary round of the men’s 100m race, finishing fourth in his heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He was unable to establish a new SAR record with a time of 10.62 seconds, just 0.02 seconds short of coming in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Noa Jerrel Bibi of Mauritius came first in the heat with a time of 10.27 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu's time was 0.34 seconds short of the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top two in each heat and the four fastest runners from the rest of the pack can advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100-metre specialist entered the Olympics through a wild card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic qualification for the 100m dash is 10 seconds and Diu’s personal best, which is also his best time this year, is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the race, Diu expressed disappointment with his performance, saying he had been dealing with a leg injury, and that has affected his training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, my condition wasn't as good as it was when I clocked a 10.33, so perhaps I will just work harder next time, and in competitions next year," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While being the third Hong Kong sprinter in history to make it to the 100m race at the Games, the sprinter, 24, said he learnt quite a lot from his "unforgettable" Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a rather shocking and exciting experience. There are so many spectators in the stadium cheering for athletes, it's really something different."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cathay Pacific says it will step up flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764594_2_20240803172132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Saturday announced it will offer daily flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh from October 27, up from the current five trips per week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came after the CEO of the SAR's flag carrier, Ronald Lam, signed an agreement to boost its partnership with Cambodia Airports during Chief Executive John Lee's recent six-day Asean trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision is also part of Cathay's plan to prepare for the completion of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group emphasised that it will continue to strengthen its existing routes, as well as expand its network and collaboration with Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, this year marks the 75th anniversary since Cathay operated its inaugural flight to Vietnam. The airline announced that it will kick off another round of recruitment in the country this month, after welcoming more than 170 Vietnamese flight attendants earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And low-cost airline Hong Kong Express, which is owned by Cathay, is planning to start flights between Hong Kong and Phu Quoc – a Vietnamese island – in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay currently flies to 17 Asean destinations, with over 360 flights per week.

 Customs on Saturday said they arrested three men after finding nearly HK$6 million worth of suspected heroin inside a shipment of durians and mochi at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said the air consignment containing 8.4 kilogrammes of the drug came from Malaysia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers on Friday found 24 packs of heroin in the shipment, which was declared as carrying the pungent fruit and mochi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then arrested three men aged 25 to 53 in Mong Kok on the same day during a "controlled delivery operation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added an investigation is ongoing.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Speaking on a radio programme, Rosanna Law pointed out that the figure is equivalent to a medium-sized public housing estate. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764573_1_20240803120315.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority has taken back 5,000 public rental housing units from tenants over the past two years after they were found to have been abusing public housing resources, Director of Housing Rosanna Law said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Law pointed out that the figure is equivalent to a medium-sized public housing estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chun Yeung Estate in Fo Tan provides around 4,800 units. Therefore, by recovering 5,000 units due to tenancy abuse is equivalent to a medium-sized estate," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the recovered flats are located in developed or urban areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said renovation for the retrieved flats would only take a few months, and they then could be allocated to people on the waiting list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have been working with property management companies to combat tenancy abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far, 38 flats have been taken back after companies filed reports of suspected system abuse, and Law said the results are "very encouraging".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had required 250,000 public housing tenants residing for over 10 years to submit an income and assets declaration form by the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the programme, Law revealed that it has already received 254,000 forms, which is more than 99 percent of all the households.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are 70 units from which we have not received declaration forms, despite repeated chasing and reminders. For these, we have already started our process of taking back their housing units."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official also added that the Housing Authority hadn't set any target on how many public rental housing units it would take back this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the beginning of this financial year 2024-25, we have already up to date resumed 700 flats, under the anti-abuse campaign. So we are expecting similar numbers in the coming seasons, and the overall full year figures should be similar to previous years," she said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Security chief Chris Tang said the proposed cybersecurity bill will only focus on protecting computer systems from hackers. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764572_1_20240803115813.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said on Saturday the proposed legislation to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity will not undermine privacy protection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment after the bureau submitted a paper to the Legislative Council, that would require the reporting of cybersecurity incidents by operators crucial to the normal functioning of society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the bureau would only focus on protecting computer systems from hackers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly the legislation targets critical infrastructure, there will be no effect on small- and medium-sized enterprises and individuals. Secondly, we have no interest in the personal information and the operational information included in the critical infrastructure. Our goal is to protect the system so it will not be attacked and therefore affect members of the public when services are disrupted," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang highlighted that the government will only view a company's information after obtaining a warrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed legislative framework, operators are required to set up a computer system security management unit, conduct a security risk assessment at least once every year, and an independent security audit at least once every two years, and report serious security incidents within two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penalties ranging from HK$500,000 to HK$5 million will apply to organisations that fail to comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the bureau received 53 submissions throughout the bill's consultation period, which came to an end on Thursday. Among all submissions, 47 of them were from industry sectors. 52 supported the proposed law and one from a United Kingdom human rights organisation opposed it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such legislation is not unique to Hong Kong. Similar regulations are also implemented in Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that radio stations and television broadcasters are critical infrastructures, and the government will not intervene in day-to-day operations of newsrooms or news content.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday maintained a steady position in the pack after two more races in the men's dinghy event, with six still to come over the next three days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ranked 28th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 65 net points, compared with 32 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

 Police on Friday said there were about 160,000 technology crime cases in the first half of the year, a 3.5 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said the total loss incurred in the cases amounted to HK$2.66 billion, and that they noted a surge in the use of blackmail apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Superintendent Raymond Lam of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said tech crime in Hong Kong is on the rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said though hacker groups are operating in the city, most cases involved overseas groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested that companies should be proactive when it comes to updating their devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of systems which the users do not update on time. If software and hardware are not updated on time, it will have a lot of loopholes. Therefore systems should be updated on time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Policy Office, meanwhile, said it checks government systems regularly, and it has not discovered loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Assistant Commissioner Daniel Cheung said they conduct spot checks, and any loopholes will be plugged immediately if they're found.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Friday fought hard for the best rank he could get in the men’s single sculls at the Paris Olympic Games, despite dropping out of contention for a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu began in the second lane of the final group D race, where he was competing for the 19th to 24th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started off second in the first 500 metres, before pulling himself to the front of the pack in the next 1,000 metres. But Quentin Antognelli of Monaco came from behind to overtake Chiu in the end with a time of 6 minutes and 54.93 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we were unable to get a medal, I hope this serves as motivation and inspiration for younger rowers," Chiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want them to fight hard for their dreams and dream big, and we can have higher and faster results in future international events,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who finished second out of six in his race with a time of 6 minutes and 56.65 seconds, ranked 20th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He previously competed in the Rio Olympic Games, where he finished 19th in the lightweight double sculls.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed his six-day trip to Southeast Asia for allowing him to "meet new friends and strength past relationships", with a total of 55 non-binding deals signed with three countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "[We signed] 12 with Laos, 13 with Cambodia and 30 with Vietnam, covering a wide range of cooperative areas, such as trade and economic partnership, investment, customs collaboration, education, cultural exchanges and tourism promotion," he told reporters in Ho Chi Minh City on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have confirmed the support from the three countries' governments for Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an earlier luncheon with business leaders, Lee pledged to strengthen ties with Asean countries and reiterated his wish for Hong Kong to join the free trade pact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is making good use of the free trade agreement and investment agreement between Asean and Hong Kong to deepen our collaboration with Vietnam and other Asean countries. And we are eager to go beyond those free trade agreements," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope, too, to join RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Through RCEP, I'm confident Hong Kong can make an even bigger contribution to the overall economic growth of Vietnam, Asean and the larger Asian region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also met Vietnamese politicians on his last day, including the chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, Phan Van Mai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other visits included a trip to a Hong Kong-owned garment manufacturing factory, where the firm's chief executive officer was quoted as saying the company will continue to keep its headquarters in the SAR and attract talent from Asean countries to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR delegation was returning to Hong Kong on Friday evening.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Brands and Products Shopping Festival features more than 250 stalls and is expected to attract 60,000 visitors. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764428_1_20240802161229.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A four-day annual shopping festival kicked off on Friday at AsiaWorld-Expo, with organisers offering free admission to bargain hunters on opening day in celebration of Hong Kong's success at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, visitors and exhibitors at the Brands and Products Shopping Festival, organised by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, pointed to smaller crowds than usual at the fair that runs until August 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event, featuring over 250 stalls, was expected to attract 60,000 visitors and generate some HK$60 million in sales revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ivan Sze, the association's vice-president, said he's not worried that sales would be affected by Hongkongers heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists being raised, we hope more mainland visitors will come to the festival to spend," Sze said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For Hongkongers heading north, dining accounts for a large proportion of their spending. But they may not buy too much across the border, because such consumption depends on the products themselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vendor surnamed Ng was selling sparkling wine at the fair and said there were several mainland tour groups visiting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were around 20 to 30 percent of visitors from the mainland. And with organisers offering free admissions, the number of people coming on the first day was about 20 to 30 percent more than last year's opening day," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It would already be great for sales this year to match the previous year's levels... I hope the government can introduce more new promotional deals, or stimulate the retail sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor from the Netherlands, who gave his name as Hugo, said he did not see a lot of overseas visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy with the people who are there, but I hope there are more people in the weekend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Macau resident surnamed Lau came to Hong Kong just for the festival and spent around HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere was quite nice, and people were very friendly. The vendors were fair when doing business, and they were courteous," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Tseung Kwan O resident surnamed Cheung said it took her two hours to travel from home to the event venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I did not have a voucher [for the festival], I might not have come... It seemed to have few people here. It's only the first day and there were only a handful of people," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An advocacy group on Friday called for more government support for people raising children with special educational needs (SEN).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People Service Centre said a survey it carried out involving the caregivers of 175 children with special educational needs found almost 65 percent would like to be able to work, while 80 percent said existing employment support on offer was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social worker Zoe Lam said mothers caring for such children can find their responsibilities overwhelming, while a lack of flexibility in the workplace prevents them from getting a job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “One of our SEN caregivers, she tried to find [childcare] services but she experienced being rejected a number of times because her son was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia,” said Lam
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to 10 percent of the survey respondents said they had been denied childcare services because of their child's emotional or behavioural condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advocacy group called for more family-friendly employment policies, employment subsidies, employer incentives and the improvement of SEN childcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want these four recommendations to be put in the 2024 Policy Address, because now caregivers do not have the choice to choose between personal development and taking care of their families," Lam said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers should avoid sharing photos or videos of themselves too widely to reduce the risk of scammers hijacking their images, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Chung said fraudsters are using technology to create deepfake images and videos to trick people into handing over money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong employees of two multinational companies have fallen victim to such scams this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If people really like sharing photos and videos of themselves, they should only share it with a specific audience group or privately. This will already make it much safer. They do not have to share it publicly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said her office received around 600 enquiries relating to fraud in the first six months of the year, up nearly 90 percent on the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said most involved phone scams, including cases where callers impersonated employees of various organisations to try to get people to give away personal information.
