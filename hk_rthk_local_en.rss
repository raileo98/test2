 The Hong Kong Observatory warned on Tuesday evening that hail could affect the SAR after it was reported in the Pearl River Delta.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hail was reported in Macau as authorities there called on residents to stay indoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Hong Kong, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 9:30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster called on people to be alert and seek safe shelter, as violent gusts reaching 110 kilometres per hour affect the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department called on employers to avoid assigning workers to carry out electrical work, and protect the safety of those engaged in such tasks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by the rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent electric shock as the air would be more humid," said a spokesperson from the department.

    Negative equity cases at their highest in two decades

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.

    'New changes to minimum wage fair for businesses'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association says the new way of calculating the minimum wage is fair for businesses. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751243_1_L_20240430180505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker and a representative of small and medium-sized firms on Tuesday welcomed the new way of calculating Hong Kong's minimum wage, which now takes into account the city's economic development and consumer prices.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Danny Lau, the honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the shake-up is fair for business operators and workers, but it is unreasonable there is no chance of the minimum wage being reduced if times get tough for businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing that we worry is you can only [increase it], you cannot decrease the minimum wage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new changes, the minimum wage would not be reduced but frozen even if the formula produces a negative number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if it would put pressure on bosses in small and medium-sized firms when the economy is not doing well, Priscilla Wong, who chairs the Minimum Wage Commission, said a balance needs to be struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These are the people with the lowest ability to bargain, the least bargaining power. And as a society, we are hoping that their wages do not go through vertically down and go down to the point that we lose our wage floor,” she told a media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing welcomed the new mechanism, but he told RTHK the administration should give greater weight to GDP in the calculations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the proportion that [accounts for] the growth in GDP can be more. This means if we have a large growth of the GDP and then we can have an increase in minimum wages level, that's very important because it allows our grassroots workers to share the fruit of economic development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Party's catering sector lawmaker, Tommy Cheung, earlier said the minimum wage could hurt the SAR's competitiveness, calling on authorities to scrap it altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But labour minister Chris Sun dismissed the suggestion, saying the new changes ensure there is room for low-paid workers to maintain their purchasing power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design of the formula is to make sure that while we remain competitive, we have to also take care of the needs of those at the very low level. We're just talking about a small number of workers. And as a society, we should help them to make sure that at the very low level, we have enough room for them to be able to earn.”

    HK to adopt new way of calculating minimum wage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a shake-up of the way Hong Kong's minimum wage is decided, with the wage floor to be reviewed every year in future instead of every two.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Calculations will include the SAR's economic growth rate in the previous year, as well as consumer prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There'll be no chance of the minimum wage being reduced regardless of what the figures suggest, with any negative calculation leading to a freeze instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it is making the changes based on recommendations from the Minimum Wage Commission, which consulted labour and employer groups as well as academics on the matter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first minimum wage under the new mechanism will be set in two years' time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The recommendations of the [commission] have struck an appropriate balance between the objectives of forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness," said Labour Secretary Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's minimum wage is currently set at HK$40 per hour. The Minimum Wage Commission is to submit a report by the end of October on its recommendations for any change.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials on Tuesday warned that an extended flu season would continue for some time, with more outbreaks and serious cases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Centre for Health Protection urged the public to remain vigilant as Hong Kong has seen a rise in flu infections, with more than 500 adults suffering serious complications or dying since January. Most of them are over 65 or have chronic illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been 22 severe flu cases among children, including three deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, from the Centre for Health Protection, said health authorities were closely monitoring the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The predominant flu strain has shifted from H3 to H1, resulting in another wave of infections. We expect this wave to continue for a few weeks, but it's difficult to say exactly how long," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are closely monitoring other regions of the world, as Hong Kong residents travel a lot. Influenza B is still circulating in some parts outside Hong Kong, so we cannot rule out the possibility of a further change in the flu strain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Health authorities urged the public to seek medical attention if they experience flu-like symptoms.

    Movie lovers say farewell to President Cinema

Movie lovers say farewell to President Cinema

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of movie lovers on Tuesday bade farewell to President Cinema in Causeway Bay, bringing the curtain down on almost six decades of showing films.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its operator, Newport Circuit, had announced last week that the theatre on Jaffe Road was closing after Tuesday, though it did not say why.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Newport Circuit thanked customers for their support throughout the years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While some people were just there to snap pictures, others bought tickets for the final shows at the theatre that first opened in 1966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo, an actor, said it was a pity that a platform which showcased cinematic productions was disappearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been here one or two times many years ago," he said. "I don't care if it's old or if the seat is good or bad, I just want to [catch a film] for the last time in this cinema."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another movie-goer, Alice, said she was watching a film at the cinema for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This kind of old cinema is very rare. They disappear when the industry is on decline and not many people are buying tickets, so I think if I have the chance to sit down and watch a movie [here] once, I'd like to go," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A regular customer, meanwhile, said the cinema brought back a lot of memories for her, from the days when people could still buy grilled squid before going into the theatre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's nothing we can do. Now everyone watches movies at home," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, a Golden Harvest cinema in Kai Tak also closed down, following the end of its tenancy contract.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they have arrested and charged a man and were searching for another over a crane collapse that killed three workers at a construction site in 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers announced the arrest of a 35-year-old former project manager with the main contractor involved in the building construction in Sau Mau Ping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been charged with manslaughter and will appear in Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a warrant was issued for a 72-year-old structural engineer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aggressive Construction Company, the contractor for the site on Anderson Road, confirmed earlier that a former employee had been arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company added that it is being prosecuted over the crane collapse.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scholars on Tuesday called on the government to offer more support for people who look after children or elderly relatives while living in subdivided housing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a survey conducted by Lingnan University and Chinese University, 95 percent of the 315 caregivers surveyed, who live in subdivided homes, were found to be stressed out, while 20.5 percent of respondents exhibited signs of depression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press conference, Ruby Lai from Lingnan University's Department of Sociology and Social Policy said caregivers had been struggling with stress from the unsuitable living conditions, expensive rents and excessive workloads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we see is that there are many spatial constraints at home, like there's no separations of kitchen and toilet, or there's no independent cooking place, so that they have to set up a makeshift cooking space for them to cook every time and then to pack up all the things to leave this space for their children to do homework," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai called on the government to ensure better quality of life for caregivers living in such conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also called on authorities to roll out cash subsidies to relieve the stress faced by caregivers in subdivided housing, and strengthen community support.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said there's plenty for tourists to do in Hong Kong during the Labour Day Golden Week holiday, even if Wednesday night's pyrotechnic display might be cancelled due to weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities had warned that the 10-minute show at Victoria Harbour on May 1 could be called off if rain and thunderstorms happen as predicted. A decision would be made on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The display is scheduled to be the first in a series of occasions marking the city’s mega events and festivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said weather would not affect other events during the national holiday this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to do the best to ensure that [the show] will be most welcome and enjoyed by everybody, tourists and Hong Kong people. But of course, the weather is always unpredictable," he said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a wide range of activities that have been arranged to welcome visitors during Golden Week."

People are adapting to plastics ban: CE

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said people are getting to grips with a ban on single-use plastic utensils, a week after it took effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, he said there are signs of people steadily changing their habits, citing a media report that said two-thirds of people are no longer taking plastic utensils in restaurants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On complaints from some people that alternative cutlery products are of low quality, Lee said he thinks suppliers and restaurants will get better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course during the process there's always room for us to make improvements. For restaurant operators and alternative [utensil] suppliers, I believe [they] will continue to improve their work and they will continue to supply different types of alternatives to disposable tableware," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan will continue to explain the new policy, after questions arose as to whether plastic containers can be used for takeaway food.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said authorities will keep an eye on the way people adapt to the initial phase of the ban, as well as the supply of substitute products, before deciding what to do next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, the government had earlier said that plastic containers and cups – which are still allowed for takeaways at the moment – will be banned completely in the next phase.

 A paediatrician said on Tuesday that Hong Kong's flu season is running longer than normal this year, with cases still increasing rather than tapering off as expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Mike Kwan from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=949557&livetime=20240430000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  </a>
  programme that the extended flu season reflected a global phenomenon, with people's immunity against viruses falling when measures were imposed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He says Hong Kong now faces what he called a tridemic, with people threatened by flu, Covid and another respiratory infection, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, as well as other conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked when the flu season would conclude, he told RTHK's Janice Wong: "We cannot make a prediction yet because the number is still rising and we are still seeing so many of the severe cases. Unfortunately, we hear about the news of another fatal case yesterday. This is very sad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I cannot make a prediction at this moment, but I just hope that the citizens can just go and have the flu vaccine if they have not yet received the vaccine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said acceptance of the flu vaccine remained relatively low in Hong Kong. He also suggested people wear masks in crowded areas, use proper hygiene and stay home if they have the flu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of an NGO said on Tuesday that many Hong Kong social workers are experiencing burnout as they face a range of challenges, including an increasing workload as more people in society face difficulty with their mental health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=949557&livetime=20240430000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  programme,  Chou Wah-shan from the mental health group Dreams Possible said a survey conducted with University of Hong Kong academics found that 93 percent of the 255 social workers interviewed experienced a moderate level of work-related stress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the study also found signs of depression in 68 percent of the interviewees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The issue of burning out is becoming more and more alarming," he told RTHK's Samantha Butler. "Because I think in the past couple of years, Hong Kong has been facing huge challlenges in many aspects: socio-economic, political.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also, many people are feeling frustrated and are having emotional and mental illness issues. That's why the workload of social workers, as the helping profession, has immensely increased, together with the intensity of clients' emotional issues, including emotional issues, depression, anxiety disorder or even suicidal issues."

    Inquest experts differ over patient's liver failure

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Professor Henry Pleass says Tang Kwai-sze’s acute liver failure was absolutely because of a hepatitis B flare-up. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751062_1_L_20240429173646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transplant surgeon has stressed that a second organ transplant for a liver disease patient was the only way to keep her alive, as the Coroner’s Court heard conflicting explanations as to why the patient developed acute hepatic failure before her death.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017 and died in August that same year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Pleass, a transplant surgeon in Australia, said it was unfortunate that medical practitioners did not give Tang medication needed along with the steroids she was taking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s our modern system with many other doctors looking after one individual. There’s no continuation,” he told the inquest's five-person jury and coroner Monica Chow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We made the assumption that people have thought about the issue, and thought about the risks.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had experienced medical issues after the first transplant and Pleass said while doctors could have treated her conservatively, the surgery for a new organ gave her a chance of survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the cause of Tang’s liver failure, Pleass said it was “absolutely” because of a hepatitis B flare-up, ruling out the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis as suggested by another expert witness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, histopathologist Wilson Tsui said it was more likely that Tang suffered from autoimmune hepatitis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui said the high count of plasma cells and the absence of serologic markers, which are used to identify antibodies formed following an infection, indicated that a hepatitis B flare-up was less likely to have been the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To differentiate between a reactivation of hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis, [the count of plasma cells] is a relatively important index,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But James Fung, an expert witness called to give evidence again after Tsui’s testimony, said the majority of patients with an acute hepatitis flare-up would still test negative for such serological markers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung, a transplant hepatologist at Queen Mary Hospital, also noted that while a higher count of plasma cells is commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis, there could be exceptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially with very severe acute flares of hepatitis B, [plasma] cells themselves are often seen in these severe cases,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing continues.

    Govt to adopt new heatstroke rules for outdoor workers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Labour Department says its updated guidelines on when outdoor workers should take a break under hot weather conditions will take effect next month. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751046_1_L_20240429163232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour officials on Monday said they were updating guidelines on when outdoor workers would be advised to stop working when it's very hot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This would enable the department’s heat stress warning system to be in line with the observatory's warnings about hot weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory’s "extremely hot special alert" is issued when it's generally 35 degree Celcius and above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some environmental and workers' groups had called for such a linkage between the two alert systems last year when the department’s guidelines were introduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said the updated guidelines would apply next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The guidelines also set out the varying lengths of breaks workers should be given every hour when the heat stress warnings are in effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new rules state that if employers adopt a certain amount of measures to prevent heatstroke - such as reducing workload, providing shades and using mist fans to improve ventilation - they can completely cut the hourly breaks for workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If insufficient measures were adopted, the guidelines said, employers would be required to give longer breaks to workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Employers would be given flexibility to alternate break times for different workers, and they can split break periods into shorter ones so as to minimise the effects on work progress.

    Jail term needed for not reporting child abuse: govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ho Kai-ming says society will have to bear the consequences if the threat of prison is scrapped from the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751038_1_L_20240429153738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Undersecretary for Labour and Welfare, Ho Kai-ming, on Monday said jail terms for professionals who fail to report suspected child abuse cases should be kept in the draft legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, which is currently making its way through the Legislative Council, the maximum penalty for not reporting suspected severe child abuse cases would be a three-month jail term and a fine of HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, saying it is too harsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legco's bills committee, Ho reassured lawmakers that professionals, who work with children, would only face prison if they fail to report extremely severe cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Professionals will only face imprisonment in extremely severe cases. This means that professionals, who genuinely suspect that a child has suffered significant harm - or is facing actual risks - yet fail to report it without meeting any exemptions for reporting or providing any reasonable justifications, only then will prosecution be initiated," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho warned that scrapping a prison sentence from the bill would lower the effectiveness of the legislation, and society would have to bear the consequences.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Monday that a "soft sell" approach will be adopted when it comes to promoting patriotism in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan, who chairs the new Working Group on Patriotic Education, said the group is aimed at integrating patriotism into core values of the community, but this will not involve "hard sell" tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patriotism is not something that can be learnt by repeating from memory. Getting to understand is the first step. The ultimate goal is to achieve emotional identification. Sincerely identify with the country, feel proud of the country and then consciously love and protect the country," Chan told reporters after an inaugural meeting of the working group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the group will make reference to the mainland's patriotic education law and come up with appropriate and suitable proposals for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the government has no plans to legislate patriotism and will rely on policies and activities to promote it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said the government will organise various activities and celebrations in the run-up to October's 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to enable young people to learn more about their country.

    Art 23 places no limits on press freedom: Paul Lam

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Lam says there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through Article 23 national security legislation. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750995_1_L_20240429111837.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday said national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law places no "extra and unreasonable" restrictions on press freedom and the media can still sharply criticise the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an op-ed published in Ming Pao Daily, the minister said there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration wants the media to pass on accurate, fair and positive information so that officials can lead society to make changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, [officials] need to comprehensively know the ideas, needs and demands from the public [through the press]," Lam wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said so long as the media continue to be impartial, objective and fair in adhering to fundamental professional codes in seeking the truth, there is no need for journalists to be particularly concerned about violating the security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the piece titled "Change and no change", Lam said while the enactment of the homegrown security law last month marked a major change, there are also things that have remained constant such as the values of common law and the rule of law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand it improved the legislation on safeguarding national security. It also fully respects fundamental human rights and freedoms on the other," he wrote.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers and families of pupils at Rosaryhill Secondary School say students are left on their own after the school decides to cease operations early. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750934_1_L_20240428184716.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers and families of pupils at an aided Catholic school in Wan Chai on Sunday accused education officials of inaction over the institution's decision to shut earlier than it had originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rosaryhill Secondary School on Stubbs Road first announced last September that it would cease operations after the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government-aided school later said it would arrange for Form One to Five pupils to transfer to Yu Chun Keung Memorial College No 2 this September. Rosaryhill Kindergarten and Rosaryhill (Primary) School, meanwhile, will be combined with Dalton School Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brother of a Form Five pupil – a former Rosaryhill student himself – expressed concerns about his sister's education at her new school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Education Bureau was relatively passive and not willing to help us on this issue... Pupils are not as simple as assets that you could transfer to others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother of a Form Three student condemned the Education Bureau for not having met parents over the issue, which she said weighed heavily on her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee legislator Doreen Kong urged the administration to address the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We don't want this to happen again. The [Education Bureau] must explain to the public what the principles are and what the policies of the government are in handling all these similar situations,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to come out to help the students and to ensure that there is a smooth transition for all the students, especially to overcome their psychological distress."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said he would file a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I find that the school is not professional enough to take care of the students. And the administrative side is also not totally concerned about the rights and interests of students and parents... I want to clarify, during the process, what role did the administration play," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tik said he would also talk to authorities on pushing back the school’s shutdown, to let senior secondary pupils finish their studies there.

    Govt mulls manhole training for all sewer workers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bernadette Linn says the government may require drainage cleaners who don't need to enter manholes to go through manhole training. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750919_1_L_20240428170632.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn said officials want to step up training of sewer workers to prevent incidents involving manholes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her comments came after the death of two workers last week at a manhole in Sha Tin, the same site where two others died nearly two decades ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Linn said the contracts state that workers should only operate on the ground, and if relevant works require them to enter the manhole, only qualified personnel are allowed and risk assessment must be conducted beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said officials are looking into adding clauses to future contracts, requiring workers who only conduct cleaning on the ground to go through training as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you do enter manholes [in future], you have to inform the Drainage Services Department beforehand and receive its approval," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're considering making it mandatory for those doing the cleaning on the ground to also go through manhole training. This is to raise their awareness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Linn said officials are considering whether to immediately prosecute homeowners found to have illegal structures, rather than issuing orders for removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has been reviewing the Buildings Ordinance after cases of unauthorised structures were reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development secretary said the administration is studying whether the prosecution process can be streamlined, the prosecution threshold lowered and relevant fines raised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that a clause in the current legislation stipulates harsher penalties for offenders who "knowingly" violate the law. Linn said officials want to remove such wording, which she said allows homeowners to claim they were not aware of the illegal structures and that the problem had already existed before they bought the place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said officials will make sure the relevant amendments – to be put forward in the final quarter of this year – will be reasonable.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Kevin Yeung said a pyrotechnic display scheduled for May 1 may be cancelled because of bad weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show, hosted by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, is set to be held across Victoria Harbour to kick off a campaign of regular fireworks displays aimed at boosting tourism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But according to the Observatory's forecast, the weather on Labour Day is expected to be cloudy with showers and squally thunderstorms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for culture, sports and tourism on Sunday said authorities could wait until Wednesday to decide whether the show would be held as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We shall keep an eye on the weather and make announcements as early as possible. It may not be until the afternoon of May 1 that we can officially say whether the display will be affected," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that tourists coming to Hong Kong will be prepared mentally that some performances may not be possible due to the rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the administration is prepared for the arrival of visitors in the coming week, adding that hotel bookings for the Golden Week holiday have been strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Golden Week holiday will help boost businesses in Hong Kong. Of course, I hope if the weather is good, it will be more convenient for those visiting Hong Kong," he said.

    Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel

Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750907_1_L_20240428151400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government on Sunday announced measures to facilitate visits by mainland business representatives and skilled workers to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, mainland residents holding Business Visit Endorsements will be permitted to stay in Hong Kong for up to 14 days, starting from May 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainlanders who wish to travel to Hong Kong for business purposes are required to obtain an exit endorsement for business visit from the mainland authorities, and at the moment they're allowed to stay here for up to one week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities also announced that mainland residents can apply for the travel document at any relevant offices across the country, regardless of the applicant's place of household registration or place of residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, Wang Ling from the National Immigration Administration said the change can benefit more than 100 million business entities across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This change aims to better meet the needs of long-term business activity and to support business professionals in seeking opportunities and conducting in-depth business negotiations. According to our preliminary estimates, the new policy is expected to benefit over 100 million businesses and more than 30,000 enterprises and institutions that have registered and applied for multiple Business Visit Endorsements," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said they will extend the multiple-entry visas for skilled workers to visit Hong Kong and Macau which currently applies only to Greater Bay Area residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From May 6, eligible talent from Beijing and Shanghai will too be able to apply for the visa to visit the two SARs, with each stay limited to 30 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun thanked the central government for the new measures, saying they would help the SAR to attract talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two new measures will facilitate Hong Kong's further integration into the national development and achieve concrete results on the solid policy foundation of facilitating the 'southbound and northbound' two-way flow of talents," a government spokesperson added in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR government will continue to promote talent exchange with the mainland authorities, to create a stronger drive for growth in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the scheme involving skilled workers may be extended to more mainland cities in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It depends on the implementation. We have the potential to have these arrangements further expanded to other cities, especially those cities with closer business connections with Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the central government will look at the actual situation and decide whether to expand or not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who's also general manager of the artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Hong Kong, said the new measures would enhance the SAR's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Singapore already provides visa-free to mainland China, right?... Hong Kong needs to be more attractive. So, today the scheme has some benefits for Beijing and Shanghai citizens. That's good for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang added that the new measures would make it more convenient to do business in Hong Kong, as mainland business travellers are allowed to stay longer in the city.

    Minimum wage needs to stay, says FTU

Minimum wage needs to stay, says FTU
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750894_1_L_20240428133152.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists have defended the need for the city to have a minimum wage and called for "reasonable and objective" discussion on the issue, after a lawmaker suggested scrapping the basic hourly rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) said the statutory minimum wage, which is currently at HK$40, is essential to protecting employees, in response to comments by Liberal Party legislator Tommy Cheung of the catering sector that the minimum wage could hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, FTU chairman Kingsley Wong said having a minimum wage in place is a common practice worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main purpose of the minimum wage is to be a policy safety net, to ensure grassroots or the most disadvantaged local workers receive appropriate protection," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the issue of the minimum wage, we should be reasonable and objective. Around the world, many countries and regions in the West and Asia have a minimum wage, so the minimum wage must be an appropriate measure then."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also renewed calls for the statutory minimum wage to be reviewed annually, instead of once every two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of a recent string of deadly industrial accidents, the FTU called on various stakeholders such as employers, workers, architects and developers to do their part to ensure occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other demands by the federation ahead of this year's Labour Day included priority be given to local labour, better protection for employees who have to stay online after office hours – also known as “invisible overtime” – and standardised contracts of delivery platform workers.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan says first quarter economic growth is expected to fall within the 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent range. Photo courtesy of the secretary's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750893_1_L_20240428120932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.

    'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'

'Keep jail term for not reporting child abuse'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750892_1_L_20240428114518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Concern groups on Sunday said proposed jail sentences for people who fail to report child abuse should be kept in place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill currently making it way through the Legislative Council, professionals such as social workers, teachers and doctors are required to report suspected cases of serious child abuse, and those who fail to comply face a maximum penalty of a three-month prison term and a fine of HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, calling it too harsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Wong from the Commission on Children – a government advisory body on child affairs – said the proposed three-month sentence is reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ultimate objective is to protect the children. And, if we set up the penalty level, which is not high enough, the impact is not great, right?" he told reporters after speaking on a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is why we think that the three-month imprisonment, together with the HK$50,000 fine, is a reasonable threshold, reasonable level of penalty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donna Wong, director of Against Child Abuse, said the proposed penalty should not be lowered, citing the 1,457 child abuse cases reported last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lowering the penalty will hinder the development of the mandatory reporting of the trial bill, because it will lower the effectiveness of the bill and hinder the deterrence effect," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said he believes a balance could be struck between bringing in a deterrent mechanism against the non-reporting of child abuse and addressing concerns of professionals who may be affected by the proposed law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the most important thing is we need deterrence against serious cases. But if the cases are minor, as often is the case, we think we can find a package that is acceptable to both the relevant sectors and those advocating for child protection," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Legco bills committee is scrutinising the proposed legislation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Saturday that they had arrested a truck driver after an accident at about 4pm in which six people were injured.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said a 68-year-old man was driving a minibus along Kam Sheung Road towards Yuen Long, when it was hit by a truck driven by a 56-year-old man.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minibus hit a lamp post and flipped on to its side, and the police said the truck didn't stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the truck driver failed an alcohol test, and was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, drunk driving, reckless driving after a traffic accident and failure to report a traffic accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five women and a man were slightly injured and were taken to hospital.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board's executive director on Saturday said he thinks major events like the Victoria Harbour firework and drone displays will still be a big draw for mainland visitors during the Golden Week holiday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Dane Cheng said he expects more than 800,000 mainland tourists to visit the SAR during the break, but that he doubts the numbers can return to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's unrealistic for Hong Kong to return to the tourist figures of 2018 and 2019. Hongkongers find it difficult to accommodate so many tourists, no matter where they come from. Even when taking public transport like the bus and train, or going shopping, there are many people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to create a good experience for both visitors and locals. Of course visitors hope to have a good experience when they come, and not encounter crowds everywhere they go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that he is in talks with the government and vendors to see whether the revamped Temple Street Night market can be made permanent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the Tourism Board announced that the market, part of the government’s "Night Vibes Hong Kong" campaign to spice up the city’s nightlife, would stay until the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government has announced a series of measures to prepare for the influx of visitors, such as allowing cross-border shuttle buses to increase service frequency and extending the operating hours of the last East Rail Line train to Lo Wu on some days. The MTR also said it would increase train services on seven rail lines, adding a total of 540 train trips during Golden Week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland's Golden Week break runs between May 1 and May 5.

Police Commissioner praises Mong Kok CCTV cameras

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said security cameras, installed in Mong Kok this month, have helped officers detect two serious crimes. Their installation was the first stage of a government plan to install about 2,000 CCTV cameras across Hong Kong this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Siu said the surveillance cameras had been effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In just half a month, we detected two serious crime cases with the help of CCTV cameras. One was related to possessing imitation firearms, and we arrested three men. The other one was a robbery case, and we arrested a man within 24 hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After installing these 15 CCTV cameras, we will see if there’s anything we can improve. We will then install 600 cameras at crime black spots across Hong Kong in the middle of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about privacy concerns, Siu said the Privacy Commissioner had given advice to the government, and that the authorities had also asked an independent consultancy firm to conduct a privacy impact assessment.

    Treasury chief says CSRC measures can be a boon for HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Services Minister Christopher Hui on Saturday said a recent move by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide more mainland business for Hong Kong is an opportunity for the SAR's financial sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measures, announced earlier this month, include opening up more Hong Kong-based exchange-traded funds for mainland investors and encouraging mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Hui said the stock exchange is currently processing around 100 listing applications from outside Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through the efforts of our stock exchange and other parties, we have been promoting the advantages of our Hong Kong listing platform to different potential issuers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe, with the support of our country's policy, our stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission will continue to work hard and encourage more companies to consider using Hong Kong as a listing platform for their financing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about a rise in bankruptcy petitions, Hui said he believed this was due to a number of reasons, including high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is due to several factors. Of course, some past petitions might come back after the pandemic. At the same time, the economic situation could play a part," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The treasury chief added that officials would continue to monitor the changes in the figures before deciding whether action was needed.

    Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750796_1_L_20240427112917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Saturday said the operating costs for light public flats should not be compared with traditional public housing units, as the government prepares to take applications for the first of the flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to a question on an RTHK radio show, she said the new flats have a different set of facilities so an exact comparison cannot be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional public flats, the operating cost only includes about HK$500 for cleaning and security, and about HK$400 for maintenance and repair work, so it's a total of about HK$1,000," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But there are additional social welfare facilities for light public flats, and there are social welfare organisations providing services for residents. For example, there may be a shared living room for residents, and activities for them. Like transitional housing, there are shops, restaurants, or laundry services for residents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of the modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address to fill the short-term gap in public housing supply, will be completed in Yuen Long in the first quarter of next year. About 2,100 will be available with applications starting in the next few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said she was confident that 30,000 light public housing units would be completed by 2027 at the latest.

    Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister

Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750786_2_L_20240427135328.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said the public was adapting quickly to the plastic-free scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban started on Monday, and restaurants are now barred from selling and using plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told a radio programme that authorities had visited about 1,700 retail and catering premises in the past week and almost all of the large chains, and about half of the smaller restaurants, had changed to non-plastic utensils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of effectiveness, many chain restaurants told us that about 60 to 70 percent of customers, who bought takeaway food, didn't need disposable utensils. This phenomenon is very good because one of the aims of the plastic ban scheme was for people to bring their own utensils," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A chain supermarket was found to be selling sushi in paper boxes this week, with people describing it as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said it's unreasonable and unnecessary for supermarkets to use non-plastic packaging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Supermarkets may allow customers to eat at their tables. People normally think it's considered as dine-in, but in this situation, supermarkets expected customers to take out their food. In reality, a lot of people do take away their food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When supermarkets pack their food, they won't know whether customers will choose to take out or dine in... We think that treating this as takeaway is appropriate, according to the regulations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the quality of non-plastic utensils, Tse said the ban had just begun, and he believed that restaurants would be able to choose better substitutes later on.

    Non-plastic prices to fall as use increases: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment chief Tse Chin-wan has stressed that a ban on single-use plastics is not meant to trouble people, saying prices for alternatives will go down further when they become more common.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect on April 22, prohibiting the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse told RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme, which was broadcast on Saturday, that the policy is not intended to make people's lives more difficult but to regulate plastics at source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those disposable tableware, if you switch to the alternatives, the difference is actually very small, usually one or two cents to a maximum of 50 cents for the whole package. Therefore, it's not very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that as more and more will be used in society, the price will go down further. People's behaviour will drive the development of the alternatives, as well as drive down the price of those alternatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said authorities must find reliable substitutes before expanding the scope of scheme, as he ruled out imposing a blanket ban on plastic products because their use is too widespread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not going to ban the use of all plastics at once. That is not possible... We start with those which we already have readily available and mature alternatives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the postponed municipal solid waste charging scheme, the environment minister said there are proven effects of the policy in Seoul, where the amount to garbage produced was cut by 60 to 70 percent in about five to 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government pushed back the implementation of the waste charging to August, while it held trials for the scheme at more than a dozen premises this month.

    Govt lowers Sha Tin Trunk Road estimated cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has put forward minor tweaks to the planned construction of a new road in Sha Tin in hopes of cutting the estimated cost of the project by five percent to HK$6.81 billion amid criticism of its hefty price tag.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a revised funding request for the Trunk Road T4, the administration said the changes would not affect the functionality of the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to concerns currently about the situation of public finances, we tried to reduce the cost of this project as much as possible," the Legco paper wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to win the support of lawmakers so that the project can be carried out in a timely manner and avoid delaying yet again the long-term development of New Territories East and the Northern Metropolis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities last month withdrew its application to the Legislative Council of more than HK$7.1 billion in funding for the planned T4 project, which connects major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River, as critics questioned whether the scheme is worth the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cut cost, the government said it will switch to using traditional materials to build noise barriers for the project, which in turn is expected to save HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will not affect the function of noise barriers. Currently, traditional materials are commonly used in other construction projects," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other changes include scrapping a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reducing the number of elevators at footbridges to further shave off around HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to discuss the revised funding request during a Finance Committee meeting next week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they had enhanced enforcement to combat traffic violations associated with taxis, tour buses and illegal cabs at renowned tourist sites as part of preparations for the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing near the Peak Tram station in Central, Inspector Lai Cheuk-fung said during the first three months of the year, police had received 23 complaints about taxis, with grievances about over charging commonly cited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai said officers would enhance their enforcement efforts starting from Wednesday this week to May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police would also strengthen education by introducing "taxi ambassadors" to provide taxi-related information to travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from enforcement, we would like to introduce a multi-agency approach to tackle this problem. Apart from tackling the problem in Hong Kong, we would like to consolidate Hong Kong's place as an international tourist destination. And this is our ultimate goal," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, senior investigator at the Travel Industry Authority, Mark Cheng, said authorities would beef up their manpower to monitor famous tourist spots and border control points, as around 680 mainland tour groups are expected to visit Hong Kong during Golden Week.

    ICAC sees 30 percent jump in property management cases

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday said it received 30 percent more complaints relating to the property management sector in 2023, compared to the year before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it received 236 reports, up from 182 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Corinna Wong, the ICAC’s director of community relations, said many of the reports last year were linked to repairs and maintenance contracts, with allegations that some were awarded through bribery or that they came with exaggerated price tags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complainants alleged that some property management firms took bribes from jobseekers, or fabricated duty records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said there were 51 such corruption reports in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said while there may be "rotten apples" in the industry, the increase in complaints does not mean that the sector has become more corrupt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes after we investigated corruption cases, and they were widely reported by the press, members of the public may become aware of that particular case and then may come forward to report to us similar cases," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the property management sector, after the ICAC operations department discovered several cases last year, there was a slight increase in the corruption cases we received."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft watchdog said it is working with the Property Management Services Authority to offer training for companies and workers to enhance integrity standards across the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority’s vice-chairperson, Eddie Hui, noted that property management workers must now obtain a licence, and that all of them will need to receive training in areas including anti-corruption awareness starting in 2025.

Police arrest 61 in dozens of online drugs cases

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they arrested 61 people, including five minors, in the past month for allegedly selling drugs online.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the suspects, aged between 14 and 59, are suspected of involvement in 43 cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they seized 128 kilogrammes of drugs, including cannabis buds, cocaine and magic mushrooms, as well as electronic cigarette pods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hauls were worth about HK$38 million in total, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said drug syndicates have created channels and groups on Telegram to sell cannabis products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Syndicates imported a large amount of cannabis oil from overseas countries to Hong Kong. They then processed the cannabis oil and mixed it into chocolates, candies and cookies, and sold them on social media platforms. In terms of appearance, they looked the same as normal products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charm added that some electronic cigarette pods have been found to contain etomidate, warning that even a small amount of the controlled drug can cause death.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Friday said they arrested a man on suspicion of possessing firearms without a licence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers found 18 guns, 11 knives, and four daggers at a self-storage facility in Sha Tin, and arrested the 67-year-old suspect on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Superintendent Cheung Ting-fung said the man had previously held licences for various types of guns, but these were revoked in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said it is suspected that all the firearms found at the storage facility this week were obtained illegally from overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the case was not related to the social unrest in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, we do not have any evidence showing that the arrested person is connected to any previous riot or violent cases. We tend to believe that this arrested person is just a firearms fanatic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case will be heard at the Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts on Friday afternoon.

 Chief Executive John Lee said cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanghai was entering a new phase as the CE met with the city's mayor for a major conference on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the sixth plenary session of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Co-operation Conference, Lee said the two cities would sign 20 cooperation documents and reach consensus on 65 projects in areas such as innovation technology, industrial development, digital economy and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the first meeting in 2003, the two cities have been engaging in more frequent exchanges... Hong Kong has become one of the major export markets and also the largest source of foreign investment into Shanghai," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng said these exchanges created opportunities and built a win-win situation for the two cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We sincerely hope that the two cities can take the opportunity of signing a new round of cooperation documents to integrate our development strategies comprehensively, create highlights for our cooperation and together push Hong Kong-Shanghai cooperation to a new phase," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong Yin Zonghua, Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan, and Financial Secretary Paul Chan, were among the other leaders and officials at the meeting.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong on Friday with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning just after 8.30 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber signal means that heavy rain, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour, has fallen and is likely to continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory warned of flooding in some low-lying and poorly-drained areas, while the Labour Department told construction workers and contractors to pay attention to electrical safety in the workplace.

    Trial and error needed for plastic alternatives: CEO

    <![CDATA[<img alt="George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes and it was the same for environmentally-friendly alternatives. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750618_1_L_20240426092723.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of one of the companies, invited by the government to meet the media and introduce their alternatives to plastic disposable tableware, says a period of trial and error is still needed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes when it came to heat, strength and storage and it was the same for their environmentally-friendly alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a point I would like to share. We all know humans have been using plastics for the last 30 years, 40 years - we have all experience," he said. "Different plastics are made for different purposes. For example, a plastic container for sandwiches is not the same formulation as a plastic container for oil or soup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said that with the introduction of new plant-fibre containers and cutlery, consumers and users needed to focus on what alternative products met their needs rather than just focusing on price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Department put on the media event as it launched the Green Tableware Platform to help people and businesses find alternatives to plastic utensils. The online platform provides a list of suppliers for the environmentally-friendly products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Thursday condemned a vote by the European Parliament critical of Hong Kong’s national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said it “strongly opposed the so-called resolution adopted by the European Parliament against Hong Kong, and strongly condemned the Parliament for making baseless allegations about Hong Kong and smearing the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said that the SAR had a constitutional duty to safeguard national security, adding that all sovereign states had an inherent right to safeguard their security in accordance with international law and the UN charter. He noted that many other countries had also enacted national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the Parliament has demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards,” the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman noted that both the NSL and the Ordinance clearly specify that rights and freedoms under the Basic Law and international covenants are to be protected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The European Parliament neglected the relevant provisions and lashed out wantonly, fully exposing its malicious intentions," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must once again emphasise that the Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against external forces that endanger our national security, acting like a sturdier door and a more effective door lock to defend our home,” the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges the European Parliament to stop smearing and interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China and ensure that their remarks concerning the NSL and the Ordinance are fair and just, and stop making scaremongering remarks.”

    'Mainland Citybus drivers may affect locals' jobs'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Unionists say they do not wish to resort to taking industrial action. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750543_1_L_20240425190732.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport unionists on Thursday spoke out against a decision by Citybus to import 20 drivers from the mainland, saying they are worried that more will come in the future and affect the jobs of local drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citybus said the first five of the 20 approved bus captains who arrive here next month will take a driving test before they’re allowed to start work, adding that they will only work on non-franchised routes, such as services for employees and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Motor Transport Workers General Union said it is worried that this is just the beginning, and that Citybus will bring in more non-local workers to operate on franchised routes down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, noted that the hourly salary of a mainland bus captain is slightly lower than that of a local, and expressed worries that local drivers may get a pay cut in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung Nuen-yui from the union's Citybus section said the company should offer better remuneration packages for local recruits before importing drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are new recruits, but not many of them stay in the company. This shows that there are issues with the pay, welfare, shift arrangements, working location and hours. I hope the company will solve these problems before looking into other solutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group added that it is arranging a meeting with Citybus and the authorities, and it does not wish to resort to taking industrial action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citybus, for its part, said it prioritises local workers and offers a bonus exclusively to new local employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department also said in response that it has taken into account the welfare of local drivers before allowing Citybus to import drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said the bus operator has proven that it was not able to hire suitable local drivers, adding that these imported drivers are not allowed to run franchised routes.

'Lo Wu will be busy during Golden Week'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Immigration officials on Thursday said they expect Lo Wu will be the busiest border crossing during the mainland's "Golden Week" holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee projected almost six million arrivals and departures for the week, with some 800,000 mainland tourists expected to come to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said Labour Day on May 1 is tipped to be the busiest day, with arrivals and departures reaching one million at land checkpoints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that between April 30 and May 5, an average of around 200,000 rail journeys a day are expected through Lo Wu, and 170,000 via Lok Ma Chau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An average of 130,000 journeys a day are expected for the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department's boundary division commander, Ng Hoi-ka, said travellers are advised to use the department's mobile app for real-time border traffic information, so they can see how busy the different checkpoints are.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also called on travellers to avoid crossing the border during peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all travellers cross the border during the peak hours at the same time, there's bound to be some congestion and longer waiting times. So we urge everyone, if you can, please avoid the peak hours," she said at a press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Generally speaking, for departures, it starts getting crowded from eight in the morning, and it'd be the busiest between 10 and 12 o'clock."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that her department has prepared for the busy week by curbing holidays for frontline officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A control centre will be set up along with other departments to monitor checkpoint operations, so officers can respond to any emergencies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Thursday said they arrested two former directors of an online household product store on suspicion of failing to supply pre-paid products to customers, a breach of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials said they had received 451 complaints against the company as of 8am on Thursday, and the complainants had made prepaid orders to the company, involving around HK$400,000 worth of household goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the customers didn't receive the products - or refunds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The online shop shut down earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs officials said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 38, on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released on bail and officers did not rule out the possibility of making more arrests.

    Non-plastic utensil firms show off their products

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies supplying alternatives to plastic cutlery on Thursday demonstrated how their products fare, with one showing how to put its straw into a sealed drink and another attempting to cut a steak with its knife and fork.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Environmental Protection Department has launched an online platform to help people and businesses find suppliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The platform invited four suppliers to demonstrate their products to the press. One of them, Ecoinno, poured boiling water inside a container to prove it can tolerate high temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its CEO, George Chen, said business has gone up by 70 percent since the disposable utensil ban took effect on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So rules and regulations are extremely important, and we believe the windows are here. So it depends on when customers want to pick things up. It's no more to replace,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The new product will allow [restaurants] to stay away from just price competition because [the non-plastic products] are sustainable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said his containers contain leak-proof materials and are 10 percent more expensive than other plastic alternatives on the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said despite this, many hotels, hospitals and schools have been placing orders because they like the high quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What are the values that they can get on it besides turnover? So this is what we are talking about. Can it, for example, be reheated? You see.. after [being heated] by 100 degrees water, it stays exactly the way that it is,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another supplier, Supply Ching Company, demonstrated how to scoop up a portion of sticky rice with its spoon. Its founder, Alvis Yip, said his company will advise restaurants how to pick between the two types of spoon it offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have two kinds of spoon in the market now. We have the rice spoon and the soup spoon. The rice spoon is specially designed for rice because it has a straight lined design. So the [spoons] can go directly into the rice, but the soup spoon is actually designed for just holding the soup and the noodles. So to use it as a rice spoon, it will be a bit soft and weak,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Usually when the restaurant approaches us, we will gather the information of what kind of product they sell. So we will suggest the suitable cutlery for them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak. The fork snapped during two attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supplier explained that the forks are designed with detachable handles, saying this makes them weaker and more prone to breakage once the handles have been detached multiple times.

    'Anti-migrant sentiment pushes domestic workers away'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sringatin, second left, says foreign domestic workers are looking at destinations other than Hong Kong for work. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750478_1_L_20240425125635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Migrant domestic worker activists have called for a stop to people who accuse workers of prematurely terminating their contracts to change employers, saying anti-migrant sentiment in Hong Kong would discourage them from staying in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sringatin, who chairs the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union, on Thursday said foreign domestic workers preferred destinations other than the SAR because of better conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is not the only place for domestic workers to find a job. There is also competition between Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Malaysia and other countries... If Hong Kong continues [to have] more restrictions on domestic workers, I think many people will leave Hong Kong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please stop [job-hopping] accusations, please stop doing anti-migrant policies, because it's not only stopping migrants from coming to Hong Kong, but it also makes the image of Hong Kong become very bad."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shiela Tebia, the chairperson of Gabriela Hong Kong, said foreign domestic workers had been singled out for changing employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If [workers] are not content with their working conditions in the company, they can easily send a resignation letter and find another job that gives them a better working conditions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why does it become an issue when domestic workers want to have a better working condition? Why is the migrant workers community criminalised because of wanting to change employers?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun earlier said a revised code of practice for employment agencies, aimed at deterring foreign domestic workers from changing employers mid-contract, would be promulgated in the second quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the planned changes, firms would be asked to explain clearly to helpers on requirements to change employers and employment agencies would be banned from providing monetary incentives for workers to quit early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Immigration Department refused about 500 employment visa applications from foreign domestic workers for suspected job-hopping.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department said some high-speed rail services to and from the mainland were cancelled on Thursday due to bad weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains G6527, G6515, G6529, G6535, G6528, G6516, G6530 and G6536 to Guangzhounan (Guangzhou South) were cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the destination of train G6510 and the departure station for train G6511 were changed to Shenzhenbei (Shenzhen North) instead of Guangzhounan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said people could consider using alternative transport to get to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Meteorological Centre said it expects heavy rain to continue to hit Guangdong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environment and Ecology Bureau clarified that shops could still use plastic containers to pack takeaway food, after a supermarket chain was found using paper food boxes to pack sushi, much to the irritation of some customers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A photo went viral online, showing Japanese discount retailer DON DON DONKI using non-plastic, non-transparent containers to pack sushi, with netizens describing that as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching out through its “Big Waster” social media account, the bureau said using plastic packaging was still ok for now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This situation is the same with takeaways, so supermarkets can still use plastic boxes and lids to pack takeout sushi. Of course, they can also use transparent boxes, so customers can clearly distinguish the food quality and types," it wrote on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) also reassured people that purchasing or using disposable plastics will not lead to any legal violations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the EPD clarified that eating inside a food court in a shopping mall or a department store is considered as dine-in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it stressed that the plastic ban does not apply to pre-packaged food products displayed on shelves in food courts, because these products can be seen as takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say the driver of a school bus died after he accidentally fell from the vehicle, which then rolled over him in Diamond Hill on Wednesday, while in a separate incident a driver was killed in Lau Fau Shan when his truck slid down a slope, trapping him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers say the 47-year-old bus driver was preparing to leave the car park of a housing estate on Hammer Hill Road not long after 4pm when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man suffered multiple injuries but was conscious when he was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He later lost consciousness  where he was declared dead just after 9.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about 6.30pm, police were called to Lau Fau Shan to reports that a man was trapped between a medium-sized truck and some water tanks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers say that initial investigations show that the man had parked the truck, which was linked to a container trailer and the water tanks, on a slope near Fung Kong Tsuen Road. After he got out, police believe the truck rolled backwards, leaving him trapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were able to release the 67-year-old driver but he was declared dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kowloon East police are looking into the Diamond Hill incident while officers in New Territories North are checking on the Lau Fau Shan case.

    HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn

HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750420_1_L_20240425014336.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

  “New quality productive forces” — a concept introduced by President Xi Jinping and highlighted in Premier Li Qiang’s work report — refer to productivity increases helped by breakthroughs in technology, rather than in traditional industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, the council's executive director, Mohamed Butt, said new quality productive forces, also known as NPF, could help attract more businesses to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This NPF can empower the growth of new industrialisation, as well as enhance our capability to become a stronger base for exports. I think in the budget speech, the Secretary for Finance mentioned that Hong Kong needs to become an international supply chain hub," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In conclusion, I think NPF can really bring in new people, new ideas, new businesses, and enhance our capability to become a stronger base for supply chain hub for the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of HKPC and lawmaker, Sunny Tan, said new quality productive forces could enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about being innovative, being able to apply new technologies in industrial development and the product development side with new products, new materials, new production processes, and also new ways of distribution," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, productive forces, really, it's about getting all stages, doing it right with, again, innovation and technology to enhance our competitiveness along the entire supply chain."

Olympians Cheung, Haughey named SAR's top sports stars

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday met the Secretary of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal Committee, Meng Fanli, to exchange views on furthering cooperation between the two cities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government said the two leaders also talked about promoting high-quality development in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said Hong Kong and Shenzhen had set up various working groups to promote collaboration in key areas including the Northern Metropolis, and the innovation and technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, which is located in the Lok Ma Chau Loop, would start to operate soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said Hong Kong would continue to build on its advantages to lead the development of the Greater Bay Area, as well as work with Shenzhen to contribute to the country's development.

    Audit Commission urges rehabus to scale up services
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Audit Commission says rehabus operators should review their routes and improve patronage. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750361_1_L_20240424164335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday called on a minibus operator catering for the disabled to beef up its services, saying it turned down requests for pre-booked trips even though vehicles were available.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In its report, the watchdog said the government-subsidised rehabus operator rejected 21,425 orders for door-to-door transportation in 2023, double the figure recorded in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were on average nine to 42 spare vehicles on a weekday from 2019 to last year, the body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission added that around one-fifth of the 121 fixed routes averaged six or even fewer passengers a month, while the waiting list for services had become longer, with someone on it for almost two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Routes running between hospitals, clinics and MTR stations operated by another company were also under-used, the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among 12 hospital routes, three were transporting zero passengers 80 percent of the time in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said the operators should review their routes and improve patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added the Transport Department should look at requests to purchase more rehabus vehicles carefully, noting the operators did not report on the utilisation of existing vehicles when asking the government for funding to buy new ones from 2021 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  124 vehicles costing HK$135 million in total were procured from 2018 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner for Transport, for her part, said she agreed with the audit recommendations.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that officials plan to look into the feasibility of expanding a mental health support hotline to other platforms, such as instant messaging apps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 18111 hotline which launched last December has been receiving around 350 calls per day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said those seeking help wanted to talk about issues such as mental distress, family relationships, physical health problems and work pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the hotline operators have referred around 200 people to different organisations for support, and two urgent cases to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said officials have been regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the service and it could be expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taking into account the outcome of the review of the operation, we will consider the feasibility of extending the service to other platforms (such as instant messaging software) in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Mental Health in due course," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials plan to ask an independent organisation to conduct a full service evaluation study in the third quarter of the year, to collect views from NGOs and other stakeholders through questionnaires and focus groups.

    Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'

Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750343_1_L_20240424153905.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Wednesday called on the government to improve labour protection, boost benefits for public servants and increase the city's minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nine labour and civil service unions issued a "Labour Day Declaration" ahead of May 1, with 10 policy suggestions, including an end to further labour imports and improving occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, Lee Kwok-keung, said the city’s minimum hourly wage should be increased by HK$15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While our proposed increase from HK$40 an hour to HK$55 seems substantial, we should bear in mind the fact that a basic lunch can easily cost HK$55. If the minimum wage doesn't even cover the cost of a meal, it's not really reasonable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, meanwhile, noted a recent 0.1 percentage point increase in Hong Kong's unemployment rate, meaning an extra 9,400 people – 111,700 in total – were out of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who is also the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, urged the government to provide a job-matching service for businesses participating in labour importation schemes, with the aim of getting them to prioritise local people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federation of HKSAR Civil Servants, Lee Fong-chung, said there is a need for the government to come up with policies to address staff shortages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the annual retirement rate for senior government positions has hit 10 percent and there has been a "huge" number of resignations in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think it's very important for the government to refill the vacancies as soon as possible, through regular recruitment or transferring some contract [workers] onto permanent terms,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the number of government workers in their 20s and 30s resigning has been particularly high and more family-friendly policies are needed to keep hold of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Like [increasing] maternity leave… And also, the government may amend some policy on the long-term investment for the civil servants, like they can use a portion of their pension fund for them to buy a house or to buy medical insurance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Government Employees Association, Cheung Hoi-wing, added that many civil servants have chosen to retire in mainland cities in recent years and the government should extend civil servant healthcare benefits to cover the whole Greater Bay Area.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.

    Officials advised to learn lessons from toilet saga

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Officials were forced to take action to restore public confidence in the 'smart toilet' after a user became trapped inside. Photo courtesy of Countryside Conservation Office." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750327_1_L_20240424133030.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials tasked with revitalising countryside areas are being urged to learn lessons over a HK$13 million "smart toilet" which turned out to be anything but.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Users of the toilet in the New Territories village of Lai Chi Wo were promised a hands-free experience, with the amenity boasting automatic sliding doors that opened and closed with just a wave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two years of construction, the toilet was completed in the summer of 2023 and was trumpeted as a showpiece facility that could boost the image of countryside washrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it all went down the pan not long after it opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On 9 December 2023, a user was locked up inside the new public toilet as the automatic sliding door could not be opened by waving hands over the control panel or pressing the emergency button," the Audit Commission noted in a report on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was later discovered that special panels installed on the roof of the toilet, which were meant to purify air as well as generate electricity, were not producing enough power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the automatic door system was subsequently disabled and the sliding doors converted to manual operation "to restore the public’s confidence over the usage of the toilet".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that as well as supposedly being "smart", the toilet was also originally estimated to have been almost HK$5 million cheaper than it was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission said the Countryside Conservation Office responsible for the project should draw on the experience it gained with the toilet when it embarks on other minor improvement works in the future.

 Legislators on Wednesday began a three-day debate on the financial secretary's budget blueprint, with many of them praising Paul Chan's efforts to boost the economy despite a deficit of more than HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Various lawmakers lauded Chan for responding to their demands, such as removing all property-cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB chairman Gary Chan said the financial secretary offered much support to the people and various business sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The budget actively promotes the comprehensive development of our economy. There are measures to support the SMEs in tapping foreign markets. There's also support for IT development. It will build a Hong Kong brand comprehensively," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB chair also said it's high time Hong Kong reviewed comprehensively its advantages and complemented other cities in the Greater Bay Area, so that the region can enjoy development synergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Business and Professionals Alliance chairman Lo Wai-kwok described Paul Chan as a "master chef" who came up with "popular and healthy dishes" despite the budget shortfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The secretary has been tightening the purse strings while rolling out a series of measures to stimulate the economy so as to make sure government initiatives would be popular. It's not an easy task," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, meanwhile, said officials should look into widening Hong Kong's tax base as soon as possible, noting the public coffers would be hit particularly hard during economic downturns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vote on the budget is scheduled to take place in two weeks.
