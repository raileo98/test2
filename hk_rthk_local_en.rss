<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Thursday said it issued a practical guide to foster greater acceptance of guide dogs and their users with visual impairments in society.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EOC conducted interviews with four guide dog users in October last year, and it found that some interviewees experienced disrespectful acts, such as being rejected from entering some premises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guide dog user Koonie Chan said many people had misunderstandings about guide dogs, and more education was needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They can't differentiate whether it's guide dog or a pet dog... I got really frustrated. I asked [the waiters], and they said 'You can’t come in because you got a dog'," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EOC said people were allowed to bring their guide dogs into places like restaurants, MTR trains and franchised buses, but there’s no legal protection to ensure guide dogs could enter premises like schools and workplaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the EOC's executive director Ferrick Chu said public awareness should be further enhanced, before making any moves to improve existing legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of low awareness, because of misunderstanding, the better way to do it is through public education... [Whether] it's necessary to write another piece of legislation to extend protection, I think it's up to the community and the legislature," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are currently more than 50 trained guide dogs in service in Hong Kong, and the EOC said some universities are looking into using robotic guide dogs to help people with visual impairments.

    Court hears challenge over golf course plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court was told that an Environmental Impact Assessment had a lot of deficiencies. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752478_1_20240509173016.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Thursday started hearing a bid to overturn the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Hong Kong Golf Club course.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior Counsel Benjamin Yu, for the club, told the court that the Environmental Impact Assessment had a lot of deficiencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He argued that the government had said it would identify trees on the golf course that could be classified as old and valuable, but no such findings were included in the environmental report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The barrister said this is "vital" to the whole judicial review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu also said a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, since authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment, but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said had the club had the opportunity to give further comments, it could have pointed out that an additional study was not comprehensive in assessing the development’s impact on the aquatic habitats at the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawyer noted that critically endangered Chinese Swamp Cypress trees on the golf course are sensitive to hydrological changes, and authorities should tread extra carefully when it is not known how the trees could be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Russell Coleman said the environment should be given “the benefit of the doubt” and should be protected in such situations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu said the report also underrated the site's ecological value, by severely underestimating the different types of bats living there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the report only mentioned one bat species, when a separate study carried out by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department found 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu added that the golf course, which is more than 100 years old, should be regarded as a site of cultural heritage, even though it is not a declared monument.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is “odd” that the environmental review concluded that the immediate impact of building on the old golf course was “undetermined” when there would be direct changes and heritage would be destroyed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government took back 32 hectares of the golf course last year, with a plan to build public housing flats on nine hectares of the land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The High Court last year suspended the environmental review on an interim basis so the site could be preserved pending this hearing which is set to continue on Friday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department on Thursday ordered contractors linked to a fatal accident at the Kai Tak Sports Park to suspend the use of an elevating work platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the construction worker, 52, was trapped between the platform and a metal structure as he was inspecting on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said officials immediately started an on-site investigation once they were notified about the accident, and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned to suspend the use of the platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The contractors cannot resume the work until the department is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added it would complete a probe into the case as soon as possible, find out if any party was liable and take legal actions if necessary, while recommending improvement measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was saddened by the death and expressed its deepest sympathy to his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The worker was found unconscious on Wednesday morning and was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.

    HK to host global aviation route event next year

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will welcome thousands of civil aviation leaders next year to explore business possibilities and open new air routes to the SAR, as the city prepares to host a major global airline route convention for the first time in September 2025.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The event - Routes World 2025 - will be organised by the Airport Authority, in collaboration with Routes, which operates global airline and airport networking events and conferences, with a particular focus on world aviation routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a signing ceremony to mark the collaboration, Steven Small, Director of Events at Routes, expects the event will attract attendees from 150 countries and 250 airlines who seek to expand their global airline route networks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These, he noted, could bring significant economic benefits to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A typical Routes World event can exceed over US$590 million of economic impact over a three to five year period. That only can take place if it’s part of a strategic plan of growth, and Hong Kong is a fantastic example of that strategic plan,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Its location, superb infrastructure, and exciting tourism offerings means that Hong Kong international airport is already recognised as one of the best international aviation hubs globally,” Small added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Vivian Cheung, chief operating officer of the Airport Authority, noted the timing of this event is very "ideal" as the city is expected to complete the third runway expansion project by the end of this year, which will enable the city’s airport to serve 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition, we are progressing at full speed with the development of what we call ‘the airport city’ to showcase attendees the city’s enormous business potential,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airport city is an area under development that would eventually comprise entertainment, retail, and dining facilities, as well as convention and exhibition venues and hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also noted the authority would take the opportunity to explore the potential for opening new long-haul flights, especially to countries involved in the nation's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to the event in 2025, the city will also host a major aviation event — the CAPA Airline Leader Summit, Asia & Sustainability Awards — in November this year.

    'Waste charging should start in August at govt venues'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Green Earth says government departments taking part in the scheme should aim to cut waste by 10 percent within a year. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752465_1_20240509160436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A green group has suggested that Hong Kong's much-delayed waste charging scheme should begin as planned on August 1, but only at government-run premises and facilities, other than public housing estates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government earlier conceded that there are still problems with the pay-as-you-throw scheme, which has been tested at 14 locations since last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an open letter to Legco's environmental affairs panel on Thursday, the Green Earth said officials should start the first phase of the scheme in August, covering government offices, parks and public schools, among other venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Participating government departments should propose clear waste reduction targets, cutting waste by 10 percent within 12 months, while disclosing the manpower expenditure and management costs of relevant premises to the public," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also said the administration should encourage the industrial and commercial sectors, non-governmental institutions and residential estates to participate during the six-month period after the scheme takes effects, and consider offering them free designated rubbish bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On promoting the scheme, the Green Earth said authorities should consider setting up a response team to gauge public opinion and use social media to make clarifications.

    Revised helper agency rules target 'job-hopping'

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752463_1_20240509155512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday published a revised code of practice for employment agencies, partly to try to deter foreign domestic helpers (FDH) from "job-hopping".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move comes after complaints about helpers switching employers within a short period of time during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the rules, agencies cannot offer money to encourage helpers to terminate their contracts early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also need to clearly brief jobseekers on immigration regulations regarding changes of employer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said some of the changes will also better protect employers as consumers, such as requiring agencies to set out in agreements the fees for each service category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[They need to] clearly state whether a refund or arrangement for a replacement FDH will be provided where their services are not delivered in full, or the employment contract has been prematurely terminated by the FDH within the two-year contract period," the department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised code also bars agencies from disclosing, posting or displaying publicly sensitive information about jobseekers, their families or former employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said agencies will be at risk of losing their licence if they or their employees fail to follow the revised code.

    Hospital Authority Convention to be held next week

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said more than 7,000 medical professionals will gather at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for an annual conference next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 160 speakers will share their views on telemedicine, smart hospitals and artificial intelligence during the HA Convention on May 16 and 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Loletta So, who chairs the convention’s scientific programme committee, said this year's edition will be the largest ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the scale, it’s actually much larger than last year. I think it’s more than last year. And it’s actually the highest number of all the previous years. So it’s going to be a very big meeting for us,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We mainly focus on the core values of the HA, which is about the people-centred care, professional service, etc. Another main point is about the innovation in our healthcare. So we have something like artificial intelligence, and then we have the telehealth and smart initiatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern Hospital will also report on its latest developments regarding new innovation technologies, such as using artificial intelligence to detect strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Samuel Lam, a neurosurgery consultant at the hospital, said the technology saves time for doctors because they don't have to go through image scans one by one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will help us to streamline the whole workflow. For example, when the AI software identifies those high-risk patients, then the intervention team will be alerted immediately in the fastest way," he said.

    Stock market rebound helps more IPO listings: HKEX

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.

 Police on Thursday were investigating a fatal accident at Kai Tak Sports Park involving a construction worker.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man, 52, was found unconscious on Wednesday morning on a platform. He was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was later certified dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sports park officials said they have offered their condolences to the family of the man, who was an aerial work platform operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that the contractor and sub-contractor involved will provide all the help they can to the family and will cooperate with police and Labour Department investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it was the second fatal accident in less than three months involving the same contractor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the firm should thoroughly review its safety management system in order to protect the lives of its workers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lo Wai-fung has made history by becoming the territory's first taekwondo athlete to make the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He's headed to Paris this summer in the under 68kg class because an opponent he lost to in a qualifying tournament in March was disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Taekwondo Association said originally, only the two athletes who made the final of the Asian qualifier would reach the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lo, 22, is now taking the spot because Ali Reza Abbasi from the Refugee Olympic Team was deemed ineligible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the male and female tournaments have four weight categories, with 16 fighters in each weight class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic taekwondo competition begins on August 7.

    'More full-day closures likely for ageing MTR'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former MTR engineer Gary Zhang says more closures are likely. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752402_1_20240509094723.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An MTR engineer-turned-lawmaker said on Thursday that a full-day closure of the Kwun Tong line for maintenance is essential, adding that more short-term closures are likely to be required as the network ages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gary Zhang, who worked for the corporation before entering politics, made the comments on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=951319&livetime=20240509000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  </a>
  programme a day after the MTR announced that no trains would operate on the stretch between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand that the replacement work this time has to be carried out at very high levels within the tunnel. And it's very close to the train power supply system" he told RTHK's Samantha Butler:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So therefore, it's basically technically impossible to just rely on one night of non-traffic hours to complete the job."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang added that the MTR was confident of completing the work within the allotted time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was very likely that more such closures would be required as the network's oldest routes, the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines, reach the end of their design lifespan. Zhang noted that the routes opened in the 1980s and had a design life of approximately 50 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said structural work like that being carried out on July 28 was "very critical to the railway operations safety and the reliability".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Announcing the work yesterday, the MTR said July 28 was chosen because it fell on a Sunday during the summer holiday, when usage was likely to be light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the other lines running through the four affected stations would remain open, adding that a free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa.

    Revamp involving railway police aims to boost policing

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they are integrating some 300 police officers in the Railway District into five land regions from the middle of this month, in a bid to improve operation efficiency and anti-terrorism efforts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After a one-month trial period, officers from the land regions will take over the duties of railway police, including daily patrols and response to railway incidents, in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Established in 1985, the Railway District is responsible for maintaining law and order in the railway system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stephen Yu, a district commander of the Railway District, said their work was affected by problems such as MTR service disruptions in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see the challenge and we encounter challenges in that by relying solely on the MTR trains as our only means of transportation to respond to rail incidents is difficult and that would hinder our professional response. The public definitely would like to see their reports to be dealt with promptly and timely," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, if there's an incident happening in one of the MTR stations, our officers will encounter problems and difficulty to get to the scene of the incident because of the suspension of the train service. Now, what we think is it would be much easier and it would be much more timely for the officers from the service side to respond. Now, that includes the emergency unit, police tactical unit, and the patrol unit of the service formation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the revamp, the railway police will be overseen by the police headquarters, instead of the Kowloon East regional headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The operations wing’s chief superintendent, Pierre Wong, said it does not mean that the long-standing Railway District is being “dissolved”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't use the word of dissolving the rail district. What I will use is the enhancement of the policing project because the railway district will subsequently come under the command of the operations wing of the police headquarters. So you can't say it's not existing. It will continue to exist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our focus is to, through the operation deployment arrangement, enhance the overall capability of our officers. That is our objective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they will also combine the railway response team and the counter-terrorism response unit to beef up counter-terrorism efforts.

    Govt to ask online platforms to remove protest song

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Lam says the injunction is not meant to restrict the normal operation of internet service providers. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752353_1_20240508203331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam said the government will ask internet service providers to remove the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong", adding that such a move will not hinder normal journalistic and academic activities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the ruling is not meant to target tech giants such as Google or Meta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the effect is to persuade the internet service provider not to provide the convenience and not to facilitate the commission of unlawful act. And that also makes it crystal clear that the injunction is not aiming at restricting the normal operation of any internet service provider," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Free flow of information is of crucial importance to Hong Kong. This is a core value that we will do our best to maintain and preserve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee also welcomed the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, he wrote that the injunction safeguards national security and the dignity of the national anthem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the song was used to incite acts endangering national security and "Hong Kong independence", causing harm to both the SAR and the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In banning the song, the Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling last year, with the three judges agreeing with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam added that the court ruling will not lead to unreasonable restrictions on freedom of expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Court of Appeal actually conducts the well-known proportionality test to consider whether a grant of injunction would in fact lead to any disproportional or unreasonable restriction on the freedom of expression," the secretary for justice said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But after conducting that proportionality analysis, the court came to the conclusion that in all the circumstances, the injunction would not constitute any unreasonable restriction on freedom of expression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing that “preventing anyone from using or disseminating the relevant song with the intention of inciting secession and insulting the national anthem is a legitimate and necessary measure by the SAR government to fulfil its responsibility of safeguarding national security”.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Wednesday said it would close a major stretch of the Kwun Tong Line for a rare, full-day maintenance operation later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There will be no service between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on Sunday, July 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheris Lee, who heads the corporation's operating and metro segment, said all four stations affected would still be served by either the Tsuen Wan or Tuen Ma lines, while free bus services would run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Whampoa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the asset renewal work would be completed in time for people to get to work on the following Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the reason why we chose the 28th of July is because it is in the middle of the summer holiday. We believe that quite a number of citizens will be on holiday on that day, and that students also have no school on that day. We are trying to minimise the impact to the passengers and also to the citizens in the town," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KH Lee, chief of the corporation's operations engineering maintenance, said they would replace more than 50 large metal hangers used for hanging power cables on the tunnel ceiling of the crossover near Yau Ma Tei Station, adding the work was necessary based on asset condition and life cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are lots of complexity not only because of the preparation of those safety precautions, but also all the work associated with this sort of hangar replacement, like in the course of the hangar replacement, we have to relocate and dismantle some of the existing overhead line and also their parts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Upon completion of the work, we have also arranged tests to ensure every system is in good order before we resume the service, so there's a reason why we have decided to have a one-day closure together with the two non-traffic hours.That means before and after to complete the work in one go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added several stations would need to carry out similar tunnel facility renewal projects in the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people RTHK spoke to said repair work was inevitable for maintaining efficient railway services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There needs to be maintenance from time to time as facilities start to age, or there will be more signal failures in the future. That would lead to longer waiting times, which is very troublesome for people," said a man surnamed Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man named Tsoi said he would leave earlier than his usual time when using the train that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman named Lam said she is a bit worried that there will be huge crowds while travelling that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It could be quite disruptive to people especially since they are working during travelling hours at some of the busiest stations," she said.

    Court grants injunction over 'Glory to Hong Kong'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday granted a temporary injunction order banning the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their decision, judges Jeremy Poon, Carlye Chu and Anthea Pang said they agreed with the administration that there was a compelling need to grant an injunction on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injunction bans anyone "with seditious intent" from playing or performing the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said criminal law alone could not achieve the purpose of safeguarding national security regarding the matter, since it is not practicable to bring proceedings against "unidentifiable" people online who commit offences in relation to the song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that there had been "widespread and persistent" flouting of the law before and especially after the national security law came into force in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such is the seriousness of the criminal problems that the court must intervene immediately to prevent the continuation of the prevailing unlawful state of affairs; otherwise any further damage to national security would likely to be irreparable," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said the injunction was necessary to persuade internet platforms to remove "problematic" content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They agreed with a lower court ruling earlier that the injunction may have “chilling effects”, but said it has addressed concerns about the right to free expression by allowing exceptions for lawful action connected to the song, such as academic and reporting activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lower court had last year rejected the government's bid for an injunction, saying it would be "of no real utility". The Department of Justice appealed against that ruling.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said professionals who came to Hong Kong through a new admission scheme have created billions of dollars of economic output.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the second day of a talent summit in Wan Chai, Sun said the government recently conducted a study to see how they are doing in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We estimate that the more than 30,000 people who had arrived here through the Top Talent Pass Scheme in 2023 can bring in about HK$34 billion of direct economic contribution to Hong Kong a year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This means they help boost our GDP by around 1.2 percent a year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said many of these professionals moved to the SAR with their young families - with two-thirds of them being under 40 - and helped rejuvenate the city’s ageing society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said a memorandum of understanding newly signed between the 11 cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) would help expats settle in the GBA.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed the budget bill by a show of hands, with no one calling for a recorded vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan thanked legislators for their support, saying officials will do their best to implement relevant measures in a speedy manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Hong Kong is consolidating its finances in light of a budget deficit, much like many economies around the world coping with the post-pandemic environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief said the government is seeking to cut costs and find new sources of revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're confident and we also have determination to balance the books in around three years' time," he told lawmakers in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That does not include the proceeds from bond issuance. We're implementing a fiscal consolidation programme that is a common practice around the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that money received from issuing bonds will not be spent on recurrent expenditure, but on investment and infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong is in the midst of an economic transition with both opportunities and challenges, but the former outnumber the latter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the SAR needs to grasp the international situation better, and understand the country's development strategy as well as focus on meeting different challenges.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The man who bit off part of an ear of then-district councillor Andrew Chiu in 2019 had his sentence reduced by half a year on appeal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Joe Chen was ordered to serve 14.5 years behind bars in 2022, after being found guilty of three counts of wounding with intent and a count of common assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had used a knife to stab a couple and kicked another woman on the same day before he bit Chiu outside Cityplaza in Taikoo Shing, following a protest that took place in the shopping centre in November 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down judgment on Wednesday, the Court of Appeal said Chen had paid damages of HK$3.9 million to the four people he had attacked and he had sold his flat to pay the unusually large sum of civil claim money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appeal court judges Derek Pang and Anthea Pang said High Court judge Judianna Barnes should have considered the payment as a mitigating factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said Chen had "showed his sincerity" by starting to make compensation arrangements even before the trial of this case began, which greatly reduced the suffering of the four victims during the civil claim process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the appeal court judges disagreed with the appellant's lawyers that the starting point of the sentence was too high, noting the victims were traumatised both physically and psychologically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu lost part of his left ear as a result, and the other man surnamed Wan, who sustained multiple knife injuries, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges added they did not agree that Chen had assaulted the four because he was triggered, noting he was the one who initiated a brawl with Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fact that Chen, under the influence of alcohol, lost his temper and attacked the victims after Wan swore at him, did not make him less culpable, the judges said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also refused to accept the appellant's promise to donate his body for scientific research after death as a proof of positive good character.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it is aware of public concerns regarding the quality and safety of non-plastic tableware. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752290_1_20240508124850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that it will consider asking suppliers of non-plastic tableware to voluntarily submit quality and safety certificates, amid concerns that some products could contain carcinogenic substances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Green groups have cited overseas studies as showing that some non-plastic utensils and food containers, including some made from paper, wood and bamboo, have been found to contain the "forever chemicals" PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and fertility issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said officials are aware that there have been public concerns about the quality and safety of such products since a ban on single-use plastic items came into effect last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to a question from lawmaker Chan Siu-hung, Tse said the authorities don't demand information on any PFAS content in non-plastic tableware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To provide better services to the public and the trade, the government will consider inviting suppliers to voluntarily submit relevant certificates or documents, and listing out non-plastic tableware with these certificates or documents for reference," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also cited international research organisations as saying PFAS only pose a very low risk to people's health when products only contain trace amounts of the substances.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's investment promotion agency and its office to attract strategic firms to the city on Wednesday said it had lured 45 companies in the life sciences and health technology sector to set up, or expand their businesses in the SAR since the end of 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  InvestHK said these companies, the majority of which were based on the mainland, had invested a total of HK$6.5 billion into the city, creating around 3,200 jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing, Maggie Lo, from the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, said these firms, including pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, were impressed by the level of support available in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we approach overseas companies and when we introduce our initiatives and opportunities, they were pleasantly surprised that the Hong Kong government has catered funding incentives to support every stage of their development — from basic research, clinical trials, manufacturing to sales and marketing," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added officials would continue to encourage international enterprises to expand their businesses in Hong Kong.

    'Earlier queues for dental clinics not that helpful'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker and a patients' rights advocate on Wednesday said the government's plan to bring forward the pre-registration hours for public dental clinics only deals with the symptoms of a queuing problem, and not the cause.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau told lawmakers on Tuesday that people will be allowed to sign up for next-day emergency treatment from 8pm, instead of from midnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows criticism from the Audit Commission which found patients queuing for hours overnight to be in with a chance of getting an appointment the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Tim Pang from the Society for Community Organisation said the real problem is that there aren't enough public dentists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The queue will just start earlier in the day ... because the root of the problem is the insufficient manpower of the Department of Health, leading to insufficient service availability. Therefore, no matter how the queuing arrangements are changed, the core problem is actually manpower,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pang's view, lawmaker Chan Hoi-yan noted on the same programme that there are only about 20,000 appointments available at public clinics each day, just half of the pre-pandemic level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For every 1,000 citizens, we only have 0.37 dentists... we have a significantly lower number of dentists compared to other cities,” said Chan, who chairs Legco's panel on health services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a former president of the Hong Kong Dental Association, Nelson Wong, said 108 of 300 Department of Health dentist positions are vacant at the moment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are investigating an accident in which a truck driver died in the early hours of Wednesday when he was thrown from his vehicle in a crash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The truck rammed into railings on Tsuen Wan Road near Chai Wan Kok Cooked Food Market shortly after midnight when the driver apparently lost control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 66-year-old man fell from the vehicle and was found on Hoi Shing Road, which runs parallel with Tsuen Wan Road. He had suffered multiple injuries and was declared dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traffic was congested on Wednesday morning as the slow lane of Tsuen Wan Road, near where the accident happened, remained closed.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jurors at the Coroner's Court returned a misadventure verdict for Tang Kwai-sze, who died after undergoing two liver transplants in 2017. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752183_1_20240507175609.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A liver disease patient who passed away a few months after two transplants died of misadventure, a jury at the Coroner's Court ruled on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The five-person jury returned the majority verdict following a 13-day inquest into the death of Tang Kwai-sze, with experts divided on what caused her liver failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. She died in August that year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivering its verdict, the jury said Tang suffered from hepatitis B flare-up because of her taking high-dose steroids without being prescribed antiviral medication at the same time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In guiding the jury to make its recommendations, coroner Monica Chow said jurors needed to consider whether new measures by the Hospital Authority (HA), including a guideline on antiviral prescription for hepatitis B carriers using immunosuppressive therapy, were enough to protect patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jury made five recommendations to the HA, including requiring doctors to prescribe antiviral drugs for patients on high-dose steroids for even less than seven days, subsidising hepatitis B carriers to do regular check-ups at private hospitals, educating them about precautions and symptoms, making sure doctors' clinical records were clear, and providing a reason when laboratories cancelled a test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up the hearing, the coroner told Tang's eldest daughter Michelle Wu that while her love for her mum would not fade with time, she hoped Wu could "one day fill the void left by her mother in a positive way".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner noted that Wu had volunteered to donate her liver to her mother and that showed how brave she was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All mothers in the world will tell you that [Tang] would feel comforted and proud to have such a brave, selfless, and loving daughter like you," Chow said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Christian Hospital, in response, said it respects the jury's verdict and will study its suggestions in detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had put in place measures to improve the process of prescribing medicine and the communication between medical workers and patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital again expressed condolences to Tang's family and said it would assist them where needed.

    Police aim to replace DVDs with digital image storage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security chief Chris Tang on Tuesday said the police want to build a digital platform to store images and videos with evidential or intelligence value, instead of using DVDs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official told a Legco security panel meeting that it would be more efficient and less labour-intensive to upload materials to an e-platform than to store them on DVDs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers, including Chow Man-kong from the election committee, said it is time to go digital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A friend of mine wanted to give the police a USB memory stick that contains dash camera footage to lodge a complaint on traffic matters, but they couldn't do that and were asked to submit a DVD. They were shocked," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said the system will cost HK$359 million - down from the HK$390 million previously estimated - and should be available in 2026, if Legco approves the funding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the platform would not be equipped with artificial intelligence or facial recognition capabilities, but those could be added later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We agree that incorporating AI programmes to our Centralised Digital Image Platform will help us investigate cases. We will deal with it at the next stage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We just need the money, the technology is already here and it can be added [to our platform] easily. I believe it's something that has to be done in future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police also want to develop a new personnel information system, which will cost HK$142 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislature's finance committee will scrutinise the two funding requests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday arrested five men over an alleged armed robbery attempt at a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At around noon, five people entered the store at the intersection of Hankow Road and Haiphong Road carrying knives and hammers, officers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they had been tipped-off about a planned robbery and were waiting nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the operation to make the arrests, officers had drawn their guns as a warning because the robbers were holding knives and hammers. After the warning, we still used our bare hands to control them," said Superintendent Gar Kam-lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of those arrested suffered a minor injury on his face," Gar added.

 As the city held a summit on global talent, the Hong Kong Talent Engage began a two-day career expo on Tuesday, attracting professionals from the mainland and foreign countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A job seeker from Brazil said he had worked in two mainland cities, Shanghai and Hangzhou, for five years and had just come to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the talent scheme makes it easier for people like him to work in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With this visa, I have this opportunity to come, and there's no limitations on what kinds of companies I can work for... This city is very business friendly. People have an entrepreneurial mind," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Top Talent Pass Scheme is one of several talent-admission schemes introduced by the SAR government, and even people who have not secured a job offer in Hong Kong can apply for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another job seeker from Sichuan Province said she wanted to find a job in Hong Kong because of the labour market situation on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could hardly get a [response from mainland companies]. I think I can find more opportunities here. I think I can improve my skills and have a better lifestyle here," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recruitment agency said support for workers was very important in order to retain them in a long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe a lot of talent from outside of Hong Kong have got all skill sets that we lack or we're short of," said Eric Ng, chief strategy officer at the agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think all the corporations need to get ready so that they not only can attract them to come, but can retain the talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Professor David Cardwell, echoed Labour Secretary Chris Sun's views that a focus should be on attracting talent from Southeast Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the best talent, academic talent, are in Southeast Asia. The world just needs to adapt to that, to celebrate those talents, but Southeast Asia needs to make it easy for the world to do that as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CareerConnect Expo runs from Tuesday to Wednesday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.

    'Improved dental registration to avoid queuing pain'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health secretary Lo Chung-mau said at Legco that officials are working to develop a registration and disc distribution system." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752127_1_20240507124501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Preliminary registration for dental appointments at government clinics will start four hours earlier than usual from July to prevent patients from queuing overnight and making multiple trips, according to officials, after the city's auditor called on authorities to review the arrangements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission earlier observed some patients queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment for the following day before registration starts at 12am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under current arrangements, patients who have pre-registered to see the dentist must return to the clinic in person in the morning to pick up a disc for their appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Legco's public accounts committee, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said registration would instead begin at 8pm for the following day's slots starting from July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After [preliminary] registration, patients only need to report to the clinic half an hour before the appointed time and have their identity cards checked, and then they can receive service. The improved arrangement can avoid the pain of queueing overnight and making multiple journeys to the clinics," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Thursday, registration and disc distribution at a Sai Kung government dental clinic would begin at 1pm instead of 11am, so that patients can immediately receive services that begin at 1:30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said an electronic system for appointment registration at dental clinics was in the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patients no longer have to physically get a disc. The online platform will provide information of the number of remaining quota discs of the 11 clinics. We have started the work of developing the system, which will be launched shortly," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials attributed a shortage of dental staff to difficulties in increasing the annual quota of appointment slots, with Director of Health Ronald Lam pointing to a shortfall of 108 practitioners, which accounted for 30 percent of the total manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said authorities decided to allocate to more resources to serving the underprivileged by raising the number of slots from 20,000 to 60,000 next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Tuesday said the government's efforts to attract talent to the city will focus on professionals from Southeast Asia and Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun’s remark came after the government approved 180,000 talent importation scheme applications, with 120,000 people having already arrived in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Global Talent Summit, Sun said most of the applicants were from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the labour minister said the government is committed to welcoming talent from all over the world, with a focus on Southeast Asia and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very sure once we have let them know all the growth prospects, all the very exciting opportunities here in Hong Kong, a lot of the talents in Southeast Asia as well as in Europe, they will be thinking about Hong Kong and they will really give Hong Kong a good shot," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said the government expects around 7,000 people to attend the two-day summit at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping on Tuesday said the central government fully supports Hong Kong in attracting international entrepreneurs and talent to develop their ambitions in the SAR, as well as the integration of the Greater Bay Area into global innovation networks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Global Talent Summit in Wan Chai, Wang said the nation has the largest talent resources pool in the world, with over 80 million technical professionals and over 200 million skilled workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of people who have received higher education exceeds 240 million, while China is ranked first in the world for the number of research and development personnel and patent applications, the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang said these things provide a solid foundation for the nation to support Hong Kong in building a “new highland” of international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The central government attaches great importance to Hong Kong's role in building human resources, and fully supports Hong Kong in conducting wider and closer exchanges and cooperation with other parts of the world to attract aspiring entrepreneurs to Hong Kong to develop their ambitions”, said Wang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We support building a high-level talent base in the Greater Bay Area, attracting global high-level innovation talent, businesses, as well as research institutions to the Greater Bay Area, as well as promoting the region to be integrated into the global innovation networks,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to China’s transition towards high-quality development, the minister also said the nation will concentrate on industrial modernisation and cultivate more high-quality, innovative professionals to develop “new quality productive forces”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nation will also push forward creating mechanisms and platforms to introduce global talent into the Greater Bay Area, which will provide new impetus for Hong Kong’s prosperity and integration into national development, she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that Hong Kong is the place to be for global talent, in part because the SAR has long been one of Asia's most liveable cities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a government-organised summit on talent, the CE said Hong Kong is the only city where "the global and China advantages" come together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that other institutional strengths include prime business prospects because of the One Country, Two Systems principle, a low tax system as well as the free flow of information, capital, goods and people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said language is never a problem because English and Chinese are both official languages in the SAR, and Hong Kong will get even more multilingual as it thrives as a cultural hub where East meets West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that 40 percent of the territory is earmarked as country parks with a UNESCO geopark, endless hiking trails and stunning beaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, you don't just get world-class work opportunities, you get a satisfying life, too," Lee said in an opening speech at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, choosing to relocate to Hong Kong on your own or with your loved ones is a big decision. But I'm here to tell you, that this is the place where you can work hard, play hard and enjoy hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the central government's recent move to relax visa rules for Shanghai and Beijing businesspeople to come to Hong Kong will promote professional exchanges and reinforce the SAR's role as the country's international talent hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also thanked senior officials from Beijing, particularly Minister of Human Resources and Social Security Wang Xiaoping, as well as those from Guangdong and Macau, for attending the summit and sharing their ideas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people over the alleged abduction of a woman in Tsim Sha Tsui on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers were notified at around noon that two masked men dressed in black had attacked a woman and bundled her into a vehicle at the junction of Ichang Street and Hankow Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman, 47, was later found unharmed in a different vehicle near Heng On Estate in Ma On Shan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inspector Chan Kwan-to on Tuesday said officers arrested two men and a woman on suspicion of various offences, including unlawful detention and driving without a licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said officers believe the alleged kidnappers and victim already knew each other and that they were involved in a financial dispute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's thought the woman was first taken to a flat in Tsing Yi and was released following discussions over a HK$100,000 debt, the inspector said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The five-day Golden Week holiday ending on May 5 saw some 766,000 mainland visitor arrivals to Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752047_1_20240506213637.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More mainland tourists came to Hong Kong during the Golden Week holiday compared to the previous year, the government revealed on Monday, saying the number of inbound arrivals from across the border met expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration said the city saw about 766,000 mainland visitor arrivals over the five-day break ending on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On average, Hong Kong recorded some 153,000 inbound trips from the mainland each day, about 22 percent more than last year's Golden Week holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the Golden Week was affected by the rain most of the time, the number of mainland visitors reached around 760,000, matching our initial estimate and bringing Hong Kong's economy with more than HK$2 billion consumption returns," said Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 570 tour groups from the mainland came to Hong Kong during the five-day period, while May 2 recorded the highest number of inbound arrivals with 192,000 people arriving in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials earlier estimated about 800,000 mainland visitor arrivals for the holiday period.

    Fire services body reports potential data leak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Fire Services Department says there's no evidence that data subject to a potential leak has been released. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752042_1_20240506205340.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department (FSD) on Monday said the personal information of thousands of people, including its staff and individuals who filed tree collapse reports during a super typhoon, could have been leaked after the right to access the data was altered without permission.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it reassured the public there was no evidence that any such data had actually been released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it discovered personal data potentially being exposed on one of its IT systems last Friday, which involved the surnames and telephone numbers of some 480 people who had reported tree collapses when Super Typhoon Saola hit Hong Kong in September last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 5,000 fire services staff were also affected and had their names, phone numbers, ranks and numbers, and postings subject to the potential leak, with some even having their incomplete identity card numbers possibly exposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The FSD believes that the incident happened when the outsourced contractor handled the data migration procedure. During the process, the access right of the data was found altered without authorisation, posing a potential risk of data leakage," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department has demanded the outsourced contractor to immediately suspend the system and all of its contract jobs, while withdrawing its access right to the system to prevent data being exposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also apologised and notified those affected through text messages or phone calls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest incident came after a string of data breaches at major public bodies, such as the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Companies Registry, with a lawmaker calling for the heads of government departments responsible for such leaks to be held accountable for the blunders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tamar Park exhibition featuring hundreds of luminous ovoids will be extended by six days until June 8, officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apo Wu, who heads the Art Promotion Office, said some 900,000 people have already been to see the "teamLab: Continuous" exhibition since it opened as part of "Art@Harbour 2024" on March 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It surpassed our expectation. We do hope that more people can visit the exhibition and take advantage of the opportunity, which is why we extended the period by almost a week. We hope to see more visitors in the remaining time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu said the free exhibition has been a hit with mainland tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of similar exhibitions in the mainland, but they require an admission fee. So I think this exhibition has an attractiveness to people from the mainland. The weather during the Labour Day Golden Week was really bad with heavy rain, but we still saw some people go during light rainy periods," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an outdoor exhibition after all so the weather does affect the viewing experience. So we hope for the remaining viewing period, the weather will be nice, so that more people, despite the ending of the holiday period, can come back to Hong Kong to experience [the exhibition]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu added that a requirement for visitors to make bookings for part of the exhibition area will be scrapped from May 8.

    Jury to decide if liver patient died of misadventure

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jurors looking into the death of a liver disease patient, who died a few months after two transplants, were told on Monday to consider ruling that she died of misadventure or natural causes, or, less preferably, give an open verdict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, had two liver transplants in April 2017 after suffering from acute liver failure. But her condition worsened and she died in August that year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After hearing from more than a dozen doctors who testified at court, coroner Monica Chow gave guidance to the jury on the 12th and final day of the inquest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner said if members of the jury, based on all the evidence heard in court, believed her liver failed because of a steroid or a kind of anti-cholesterol medication, then they should rule that she died of misadventure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, she said, if they think Tang actually suffered from auto-immune hepatitis and that was what triggered her liver failure, then they should rule that she died of natural causes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner said in case they cannot determine what caused her liver failure, the jury can give an open verdict, but there should be enough evidence to decide what happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jury will retire to consider its verdict on Tuesday.

    Punish officials over govt data leaks: lawmaker

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The heads of government departments responsible for data leaks should be held accountable and punished for the blunders, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the Companies Registry said data on some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform, just a day after the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department said a password problem put data on 17,000 public housing tenants at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quat, who chairs Legco's Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting, said personal data leaks by government departments and public bodies are completely unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the heads of departments should bear responsibility for safeguarding sensitive data, rather than relying on the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), which serves as the government's main IT support office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The head of the department should be responsible for all the cyber security issues of their own department, computer system and networking. We suggest the government to make sure that all the government heads, department heads and also the IT project heads are responsible for all the cyber security issues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, honorary president of the Information Technology Federation, said he was surprised by the apparent failure of the Companies Registry to conduct a security check on a new system prior to its launch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is actually a design fault on a new system implemented. So I was surprised why they had not done any security check before the system was implemented and launched," Fong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Similar mistakes have happened again and again in different IT departments. So if all these IT departments can get guidelines from the OGCIO, I hope we can solve this problem once and for all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong also called on government departments to enhance collaboration in safeguarding data security.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong (HKU) nursing student has been cleared of groping a first-year pupil during an orientation camp last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday acquitted Tang Ho-yin, 20, of indecent assault and common assault, two charges he previously pleaded not guilty to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court had heard that Tang indecently assaulted a woman in an activity room at Po Leung Kuk Jockey Club Tai Tong Holiday Camp on August 20, 2023, and groped her again in a dormitory living room the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, magistrate Frances Leung said the witness of the first alleged incident, during a game at the orientation camp, failed to identify the facial features of the perpetrator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court was not reassured that the defendant was the perpetrator, Leung added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the common assault charge against Tang, the judge said the court accepted that the defendant's hand had moved up and down the alleged victim's arm while discussing sexual content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Leung also noted the alleged victim had voluntarily extended her arm out to demonstrate an element of the discussion.

    'Rainstorm warnings can't be district-specific'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Leung Wing-mo said it's impossible to issue rainstorm warnings for particular districts because rain is unpredictable. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751967_1_20240506120141.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A spokesman for the Hong Kong Meteorological Society, Leung Wing-mo, said on Monday that it would not be possible to tailor rainstorm warnings for particular districts, because rain is extremely unpredictable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, the Red Rainstorm Warning was in place for nearly seven hours and flooding and landslides were reported in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory had at one point raised the possibility of a Black Rainstorm Warning and some people questioned why the alert wasn't issued, even though rain was particularly heavy where they were.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, a former assistant director at the observatory, said rainstorm warnings are generally issued when rainfall at a certain amount of monitoring stations around the city meet the relevant criteria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that on Saturday, government forecasters provided supplementary information regarding the amount of rain recorded in different places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Really, the downpours are part of nature, they may happen wherever. So forecasting where exactly the rain will be is very difficult," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can only issue warnings based on rainfall for the whole of Hong Kong, that the amount recorded or the expected amount, triggers the corresponding rainstorm warning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung described the heavy rain on Saturday as rare, although he noted that April is regarded as belonging to the "flooding season" in South China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the climate has changed because of global warming and people can expect more extreme weather conditions and heavier rain from now on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Sai Kung district councillor Christine Fong said hundreds of vehicles were trapped by floods on Saturday after the heavy rain caught drivers by surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suggested officials build stormwater storage facilities or an artificial lake in Hebe Haven and Ho Chung.

    'Time for sectors to work on boosting tourist numbers'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="760,000 mainland tourist arrivals were recorded during Golden Week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board's executive director on Monday said various sectors should reflect on how to attract more tourists, as consumption patterns have changed since the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Hong Kong Economic Journal, Dane Cheng said he was satisfied that Hong Kong saw about 11 million visitor arrivals in the first quarter of the year, and he expects the number to rise in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said Hong Kong has been doing a lot in terms of promotion and holding mega events, and it's time for different sectors to reflect on how to attract more tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The problem now is, tourist numbers recovered back to 70 percent [of pre-Covid numbers], but the departure number for local people is over 100 percent... No matter whether it's the catering sector or the retail sector, if your business can't retain the locals, how can you expect it to attract tourists?" he questioned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that people should stop comparing current tourist numbers with those before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's unrealistic for tourist numbers to return to the levels of 2018 and 2019... Back then, when so many people were coming to Hong Kong, no matter which area was that, Hong Kong people were overloaded. Tourists also want a good experience, instead of staying in a crowded place," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, chairwoman of the Travel Industry Council Gianna Hsu said there were about 760,000 mainland tourist arrivals during Golden Week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after attending a radio programme, Hsu said the rainy weather did not affect the mood of tourists, and some businesses even benefited from the poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was rain occasionally, urging some tourists to visit shopping malls. Therefore, I believe the retail sales for shopping malls had seen improvements. We expect Golden Week will bring about HK$2 billion consumption revenue to Hong Kong. We look forward to the next Golden Week holiday," she said.

    'Shortened nursing programme won't affect teaching'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has announced plans to shorten the duration of its nursing programme starting from the new academic year in September, allowing students to complete the entire course in 3.5 years instead of the current four years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HA launched the Professional Diploma in Nursing three years ago, offering classes in its three nursing schools at Caritas Medical Centre, Tuen Mun and Queen Elizabeth hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upon graduation, students can choose to become registered general nurses and pursue a bachelor’s degree in other institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Au, principal at Queen Elizabeth Hospital’s nursing school, explained the decision to shorten the duration of the programme was made “in view of the arrangement of placement and learning for the students”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually there is no change in the contents we teach to the students, like the theories and the skills, there is no change, just the period has been shortened,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said students will still be entitled to at least 1,400 hours of internship in public hospitals and their learning outcome won't be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From their very first placement, students will assist registered nurses to carry out various tasks, including measuring blood pressure, feeding dependent patients and distributing medications, Au said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about the high attrition rate among nurses in recent years, with over 1,800 full-time nurses at public hospitals having left their positions last year, Au stressed the three nursing schools had already reached their maximum capacity with 300 places offered each year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said a lot would need to be considered if authorities wanted to increase quotas at the schools, including finding extra teaching space and staff, as well as liaising with the Nursing Council of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tuition fee for the 3.5-year programme is HK$132,700. Applications close on July 19.

    Clear Water Bay Road reopens after repair work

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department said early on Monday that Clear Water Bay Road was back to normal, after being disrupted by a landslide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A slope measuring 30 metres long and 40 metres deep collapsed, and part of the pavement also caved in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slip forced officials to implement an arrangement in which two-way traffic shared the same lane near Wing Lung Road in Hang Hau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said earlier that Clear Water Bay Road should be open again by rush hour on Monday morning, after workers carried out remedial work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said workers were spraying concrete onto the slope, and more work would be carried out later to further consolidate the structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we open the road, we have to ensure it's safe after the temporary consolidation work. If we can't do that, we won't open the road," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we'll have measures in place. Our contractor and the Highways Department will keep monitoring the situation here. We'll also liaise with the observatory to see if the weather will worsen, and we've installed some sump pumps in case there's heavy rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities received 14 other landslide reports on Saturday, when the amber and red rainstorm warning signals were in effect for most of the day.

    People attempt bun tower climbing in Cheung Chau

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A climbing carnival took place at Cheung Chau on Sunday, ahead of the island's traditional bun-scrambling competition on Buddha's Birthday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 14-metre-high bun tower frame is already in place for the competition on May 15, and carnival-goers were given the chance to see whether they could climb it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung said her son had managed the feat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've tried bun scrambling over the years. When my son was young, he couldn't reach the top. Last time we came, he was able to get there at a slow pace with the help of his dad. But this time, he was able to do it all by himself very quickly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so happy to see him achieve that because yesterday it was raining really hard so I thought there wouldn't be a chance. Luckily the weather is beautiful. It's a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung's 13-year-old son has now climbed the tower at least four times. He gave his advice on the best way to approach the climb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There isn't a specific technique to climbing. You just have to grasp the bamboo tightly and watch your footing. I love experiencing Hong Kong culture. I want to preserve and pass on Hong Kong culture like bun scrambling so more people know about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I personally love eating lucky buns and watching bun scrambling on television, so I really wanted to see if it is actually that exhilarating in person, and see if it's really that easy or difficult."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another visitor, Ms Lok, said she brought her friends from overseas to the carnival, so they could experience a bit of Hong Kong culture.

  <br/>
  "We were shaking while climbing because the gaps are so small, but we had a lot of fun. Huge respect to those who can climb up so quickly. I think this is a great tradition to preserve, and I love the meaning behind it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can pass peace to anyone, even if you aren't Chinese. My friends wanted to experience something quite traditional and this definitely checks the box."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, workers have been working hard to reconstruct the three traditional giant bun towers for display ahead of next week's festivities, after Saturday's heavy winds caused the bamboo scaffolding to collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung Chi-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong Cheung Chau Bun Festival Committee, said it would take one to two days to complete, but progress was going well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never experienced the collapse of the bun tower scaffolding before. It was because the heavy winds hit it down. It is quite a rare incident. The latest situation is quite ideal. We thought it would take three to four days, but they've sent more people to help so the speed has increased significantly," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at eight in the morning and everything has already been dismantled, and ready for reconstruction. I think everything can be restored in one to two days. I believe it will be reinforced this time around."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung also said the incident had incurred a cost, but he had not yet calculated how much money was involved. He added it was most important the Bun Festival runs smoothly next week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's top IT office on Sunday said it was asking all bureaus and departments to comprehensively review their data security measures, and reply within a week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after reports of two data leaks in the past few days, involving the Companies Registry and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registry said on Friday the data of some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before, the EMSD apologised over the data leak of some 17,000 public housing residents who had to undergo mandatory Covid tests in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the issue on social media, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said it's highly concerned about the incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had again sent clear directives to the heads of bureaus and departments about the reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also reminded all users and systems under the departments that they must stringently comply with the government's rules, policies and guidelines on data security in handling sensitive and personal information," it said in the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office added this includes never storing data on publicly-owned cloud platforms.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says while adjustments will be made to the scheme, officials will try to minimise the effects on beneficiaries. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751866_1_20240505125439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said officials don't plan to change the eligible age and coverage of the HK$2 transport subsidy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government plans to complete a review of the scheme by the end of 2024, as its bill is expected to increase by 50 percent, to more than HK$6 billion this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said while there's a need to make changes to the scheme to ensure it is more financially viable in the long run, officials would keep several aspects of this "good policy" unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The overriding principle is that the original intention of the scheme doesn't change - those benefiting from the scheme, that is elderly people aged 60 and above and the disabled, this won't change," the minister said on a TVB programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government did not plan to ban the more expensive bus and minibus trips to the border, saying beneficiaries have gotten used to the travel convenience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials would try their best not to make it troublesome for the beneficiaries, or affect their willingness to travel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that officials would do more to tackle abuses by those who are not eligible for the scheme, and do more promotion to encourage beneficiaries to take cheaper rides whenever possible.

    Golden Week tourists to boost city by HK$2 billion

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the total number of mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong should reach the estimated 800,000 mark with the Golden Week holiday wrapping up on Sunday, adding it would boost the economy by over HK$2 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said approximately 670,000 mainland tourists had already come to the territory in the first four days despite the rainy weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The entire Guangdong Province was affected by the unstable weather, and tourists can see that the weather is also not that good in Hong Kong, so they may postpone their trip. However, the overall numbers aren't bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that we will reach our estimated number of tourists. If we have around 800,000 mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong, I think we can earn over two billion dollars in consumption. Even though we have only reached about 700,000 people so far, we should still reach over two billion dollars."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the mixed reviews of the Labour Day pyrotechnic display, Yeung said it was no surprise that people had expectations for the fireworks show, but the weather was unpredictable in how it would affect the viewing experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rain is hard to predict, unlike wind which comes when it comes. Even if you see rain clouds, you don't know if it will actually rain. So up until 4pm of that day, we then decided it was appropriate to host the show," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was watching from the top of a bridge where the wind was hitting so from the start of the fireworks, the smoke did reach me. However, from other viewing angles, people have sent me clear and beautiful photos of the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added they would learn from this experience and do better in terms of publicity and expectation management in the future.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan is attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Tbilisi. Photo courtesy of Chan's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751862_1_20240505115210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong's economy was maintaining its momentum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan said the city’s GDP had increased five quarters in a row, with growth going up 2.7 percent year-on-year in the quarter ending in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market sentiment had also improved, he said, with the Hang Seng Index gaining almost 14 percent recently after going up for nine consecutive days, while the property market had become more active after measures to curb speculation were lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said inbound tourism was one of the key drivers of the economy in the first quarter, adding the number of arrivals during the first three days of Golden Week, which stood at nearly 650,000, was up 25 percent from last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said external uncertainties remained, and that higher interest rates and a strong Hong Kong dollar would affect the city's tourism sector, as well as export and investment sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on companies to develop new products to explore new ways to manage their businesses, noting that authorities were helping SMEs to go digital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief, who was attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, said many participants were interested in the development of the digital economy as well as the innovation and technology sector in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added authorities recently published the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, to provide a clearer definition of green products and help the sector reduce "greenwashing" risks.

    Care teams deployed after heavy rain hits Sai Kung

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said 12 care teams have been deployed to Sai Kung in response to the severe rainfall that hit the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At one point, the Observatory recorded over 200 millimetres of rain in the district, causing significant flooding on several roads, including Po Lam Road North and Wan Po Road in Tseung Kwan O, as well as Pak Sha Wan Street in Sai Kung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home affairs minister said some care team members were already on duty in temporary shelters while others were checking the district for floods and reporting to the Sai Kung district officer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also dismissed claims that some care team members didn't turn up when the rain was at its hardest on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Care team members are volunteers and they are fully dedicated to their work. However, during periods of heavy rainfall and when there are floods, the responsibility for addressing standing water and flooding falls to the government's professional departments,” she said. “I think the general public don’t expect care teams to deal with the floods without the necessary equipment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that most floods in the district had been dealt with before noon and most roads affected had been reopened by 2 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the Home Affairs Department had opened nine temporary shelters across Hong Kong for people in need of temporary accommodation.

    Observatory cancels amber rainstorm signal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the amber rainstorm warning signal at 8.45pm on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said heavy rain over Hong Kong had started to ease. The Observatory had issued the amber signal to replace the red rainstorm warning just before 4pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the forecaster has also warned that another intense band of thundery showers is edging towards the Pearl River Estuary, and this might still affect Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The red signal had been in place since about 9 am and, at around noon, the Observatory warned it might issue its maximum black signal as even heavier rain started to fall across Hong Kong, especially in the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Drainage Services Department said it mobilised about 70 emergency response teams to handle flooding, involving over 160 emergency response teams comprising about 600 people. It said that by 7.30pm, all 16 flooding cases, including 12 in the Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O areas, had been resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Geotechnical Engineering Office said it received 15 reports of landslides in the Sai Kung area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fire Services Department said that as of 7pm it had handled 25 reports of people trapped in lifts, and 71 reports from automatic fire alarm systems. It said fourteen people were evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it received 22 reports of fallen trees with no injuries as of 8pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Home Affairs Department said it had opened nine temporary shelters located in Southern District on Hong Kong Island, Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City in Kowloon, and Tseung Kwan O and Sai Kung in the New Territories.

 Police on Saturday rescued two groups of hikers near Sai Kung, as heavy rain fell over Hong Kong, particularly in the east.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a group of 11 mainland tourists, including seven children, contacted police at about 11.30 am, after finding themselves stranded at High Island Reservoir East Dam. They had previously been camping in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about the same time, rescuers were also called in by four local hikers who found themselves in difficulty on section two of the MacLehose Trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said they were able to locate all of the stranded hikers, and evacuate them, adding that none of the 15 were injured and that they didn't require hospital treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory issued the first Red Rainstorm Signal of the year just before 9 am, before saying it was considering issuing the higher Black Rainstorm Signal at around noon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 10.30 am, the forecaster also issued a Landslip Warning, reminding people to stay away from steep slopes, and to stay at home.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of cars were damaged by flood water at a car park in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday, as heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong, leading the Observatory to consider issuing a Black Rainstorm Warning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “For that particular outdoor car park area, there are around 450 cars. I think half of the cars were seriously [flooded]," said district councillor Christine Fong in an interview with RTHK. "Some of them, the water was up over the tyres, even up to the engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong also said the car park, on Wan Po Road in Lohas Park, didn't have a reputation for flooding so many drivers had been caught out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said the east of the SAR had borne the brunt of the rainfall with over 200 millimetres of rain falling in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Road flooding in those two areas also meant that only limited services could be provided at two out-patient clinics there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Department says it has opened temporary shelters for people in need of temporary accommodation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Observatory had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am following a night of rain, leading to the suspension of classes at all schools.

    New minimum wage formula to protect labour: Sun
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said the new minimum wage formula will provide support to Hong Kong's 17,000 low income workers, who currently earn an hourly rate of HK$40.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new formula - which bars any reduction - takes effect next year, after being given the go-ahead on Tuesday by the Chief Executive, John Lee, and the Executive Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the reform balanced the interests of both labour and employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has taken into account, on the one hand, the need to protect those earning a minimum wage, that their wage is being protected; and also, at the same time, to ensure that the formula is affordable, and also acceptable to the business sector," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier the labour minister told an RTHK radio programme that the government would enhance safety awareness following the deaths of two sewer maintenance workers, who are believed to have been exposed to toxic gas in a manhole last week in Sha Tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stated that new guidelines for those working in confined spaces, to be announced this month, will make it mandatory to install CCTV at the entrance and exit of manholes.

    Restaurants see 10pc drop in business on May 1 holiday

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Catering sector representative Simon Wong on Saturday said restaurants saw 10 percent less business than usual this May 1 public holiday, which was also the first day of the mainland's Golden Week break.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades president said this was partially due to 20,000 fewer mainland arrivals on that day, although the May 1 firework display had helped trade near Victoria Harbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see that business in some areas in Hong Kong - like in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, and along the harbour - because of the fireworks, recorded some increase," he said. "I did visit several districts in Hong Kong and saw that there were not too many people visiting shopping malls.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that reduced spending power among individual travellers and the bad weather during the week contributed to the lower sales. He also attributed the lower sales to many locals heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a hotel group says the occupancy rate for its two hotels also dropped about six to seven percent when compared to last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alan Chan, the operations officer of Miramar Group, said the group had offered substantial price discounts to retain hotel guests, with prices per night decreasing by approximately 23 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the hotel industry, if we need to drop prices by 23 percent to retain a certain occupancy rate, I think it’s not really ideal,” he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that this year, many mainland flights had resumed to other countries, and visa requirements had also been relaxed for mainlanders, giving them more travel options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan urged the government to liaise with mainland authorities to further expand the Individual Visit Scheme so more mainlanders could visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-day mainland holiday will conclude on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Immigration Department, arrivals on May 1 reached 460,000, with over 180,000 coming from the mainland.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday said it may issue the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, as heavy rain continues to batter Hong Kong, particularly in the east of the territory. It had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am, as the rainy weather that has hit Hong Kong over the past few days worsened.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O have seen very heavy rain with the Observatory saying more than 200 millimetres have been recorded and that severe rainstorms would continue to affect the eastern part of the SAR. It also warned people to stay away from watercourses across the territory due to the possibility of flash floods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a Hospital Authority spokesman for the Kowloon East Cluster said road flooding meant only limited services could be provided at the Mona Fong General Out-patient Clinic in Sai Kung and the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the government had called on the public to report flooding to the Drainage Services Department following wet weather overnight. There have been reports of flooding and a fallen tree in Chai Wan, and flooding on Silver Cape Road in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools have also been told to make sure conditions are safe before allowing students to leave, while all classes have been suspended for the afternoon
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also told employers to make arrangements for staff.

    Hui flags SAR's strength as a wealth management centre

 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says that the government is taking steps to enhance Hong Kong's attractiveness as a wealth management and capital formation centre in order to consolidate the city's position as a leading global financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview on RTHK's Your Home Address programme, he noted that one of the key measures introduced was the Capital Entrant Admission Scheme, which allows individuals with capital of more than HK$30 million to become permanent residents after residing in in Hong Kong for seven years. This scheme has received a positive response, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He discussed efforts to facilitate capital formation, including the reduction of stamp duty for the stock market and the reform of the Growth Enterprise Board, which focuses mainly on small and medium-sized enterprises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a very competitive edge as the equity and also bond raising platform for different corporates. So in that context, we have a number of measures laid out and actually implemented phase by phase to enhance the appeal of our capital market," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stressed that amid global geopolitical changes, people are looking for ways to diversify their assets, adding that Hong Kong can seize the opportunities arising from these challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the city is a very attractive option for individuals to invest their capital and channel investments through Hong Kong to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a wealth management and capital formation centre was evident with more than 2,700 single-family offices already established in the city.

    HA sponsors new round of overseas podiatry training
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HA sponsors new round of overseas podiatry training" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751619_1_20240503121227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) is launching a new round of its overseas training sponsorship programme, fully subsidising eligible participants to earn a bachelor's degree in podiatry at the University of Northampton in the UK.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The scheme to send people abroad for training on foot treatment was first introduced in 2005 due to the lack of recognised programmes among local tertiary institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stanley Wan, who works as a resident podiatrist at Yan Chai Hospital, participated in the programme in 2014 and joined the HA in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had graduated with an engineering degree, but decided to switch to a new career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In terms of my profile, I think I'm not really as good as other competitors, which could possibly already have a degree related to chemistry or bio-engineering,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think I showed the interviewer that I have great determination of preparing myself. I applied for the course of physiology, trying to learn something that I probably [did not] know before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also I participated in my church activities, which mainly serve the elderly.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two or three places are on offer each year, and successful applicants must commit to working for the HA for at least five years upon graduation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priscilla Poon, the HA's chief manager of allied health, said applicants actually find the requirement attractive because Hong Kong doesn't have its own podiatry registration process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it's a kind of encouragement to them… For those graduates who have graduated in the UK – despite the fact that they are able to register in the UK – [but because] there’s no registration in Hong Kong, there won't be any guarantee of job opportunities,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But if we ask them to serve in HA at least for five years, I think that will be a very positive message for them… they're still able to get a very good pay and a very good job opportunity in HA.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poon said the HA currently employs 54 podiatrists, but lost about 5 percent of staff each year in recent years due to retirement or resignations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while the current staff level is sufficient, Hong Kong's ageing population is expected to increase the demand for podiatrists further.
