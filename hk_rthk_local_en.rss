<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should learn from and embrace the spirit of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and integrate it into daily life, Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 500 government officials, Executive Council members and lawmakers on Monday morning attended a seminar held at the government headquarters promoting the spirit of the plenum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks were led by Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress and chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the country's top legislature, and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who's also the Secretary of the CPC leadership group of the Ministry of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third plenum, which wrapped up last month in Beijing, adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the seminar, Lee said studying the spirit of the third plenum was beneficial to the SAR's long-term development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand its importance and significance for Hong Kong's future development, seize the opportunities, and further leverage Hong Kong's advantages of being highly internationalised, market-oriented, and rule of law-based under the 'One Country, Two Systems' system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong plays an irreplaceable role in the country's further reform and opening up. As a super connector and super value-adder, Hong Kong continues to play an important role as a bridge and window connecting the mainland and the world in going global and bringing in [enterprises]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about measures to attract high-end talent from around the world, Lee said the SAR government had introduced a series of programmes to bring in graduates from top universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said there were 340,000 applications for the Top Talent Pass Scheme so far, of which 210,000 had been approved.

    'Revenue not the only consideration for land sales'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the economy is now at a turning point. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767645_1_20240826113833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development chief Bernadette Linn says financial proceeds are just one of the factors the government considers when it comes to the pace of land sales, saying market sentiment and the effect on prices of putting a plot up for sale are also important.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Amid a sluggish property market, the government has eight plots in its land sale programme in the current financial year. One plot in Sha Tin was put up for sale in the last quarter, and another in the same area in the quarter before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an exclusive interview with RTHK, Linn said if a plot goes unsold or the bids received are far lower than market estimates, it can hurt property prices in the relevant district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials therefore need to assess the sentiments of the market and developers when making decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the land sale programme can serve as an adjustment tool and if there is sufficient private land, then the government doesn't need to roll out as much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary noted that in the past three financial years, not all sites in the programme were made available for bidding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also described the economy as being at a turning point right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many people have expectations about the US cutting interest rates later. Will Hong Kong follow? Everyone can see the market sentiments, like in the past half a year, there has been economic growth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But everyone is taking the wait and see approach - whether the growth is sustainable. Investors are taking that approach, and so are developers who bid for land."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also shot down the idea of returning to the system before 2013, when land sales were triggered by developers' applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government needs to have control over land provision and stability, saying the public could get very pessimistic about the market if developers are conservative and don't make applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the current financial year, the government has yet to put up any commercial plots for sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said if office vacancy rates in the upcoming quarters remain similar to current levels, there's a chance the government will continue to defer rolling out plots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said there are currently plenty of commercial buildings under construction, and so supply is not a problem.

    CUHK unveils novel remote endoscopy surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The research team in Zurich demonstrates how to use a joystick to remotely control an endoscope in Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A surgeon in Zurich has performed the world’s first remote endoscopy procedure on a pig in Hong Kong, as researchers believe it paves the path for better and immediate surgical care in remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The procedure was conducted in May as part of a joint-study between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) which started two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinician in Switzerland controlled a surgical controller that was remotely connected across 9,300 kilometres to an endoscope in the operating theatre in Hong Kong, CUHK said, noting that the endoscope matched every movement the clinician made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design was to use multiple small magnets to build our endoscope and use a magnetic field to control the direction, forward, backward, turn left, turn right, to control the angulation of the endoscope to perform an endoscopy," says Dr Shannon Chan from CUHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the surgeon in Switzerland would use the controller to control the magnetic field in Hong Kong and thus, with that, he could control the endoscope.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chan said the technology could be a game-changer for remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For places where they are lacking in experts, for example, in gastrointestinal disease, then the experts in their hometown can control and perform the endoscope for patients… so the experts can diagnose and treat patients from afar,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are hoping that with this technology... we are able to train doctors in resource-limited areas to perform some procedures remotely instead of having to fly over to their country to teach them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dr Chan noted a key prerequisite would be a stable Wi-Fi network in those areas, saying that would take a few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that it's too early to compare the success rate of remote surgery with conventional procedure, saying the research team's next step is to prove the procedure is safe on human patients.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have called on people who want to join the force to enrol in their mentorship programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior inspector Jaffy Chan, overseeing recruitment, said the mentorship initiative would help candidates when applying to join the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said figures showed that one in five programme participants would successfully secure the position of Probationary Inspector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This success rate surpasses that of non-participants, where only one out of every 27 people succeeded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan explained that those who join the mentorship programme would gain hands-on experience and personal coaching from police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The very intentions of the rolling out of the programme is to allow mentees to have a diverse experience in getting to know what the police does, and how it's like to be a police officer should they join in the future," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, for this programme, every mentee is assigned with a mentor who will give them personal experience and coaching and workshop for their preparations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, 228 people joined the police mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them was 24-year-old Luce Lo, who took a two-month hiatus from her full-time job as a financial adviser for the mentorship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said she was motivated to join the Police Force after the mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My determination is far more than before I have joined this internship, because through
  <br/>
  the daily interactions with the police inspectors or those colleagues, I see some qualities and also their professionalism being a police [officer]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applications for next year's mentorship programme will open on September 9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) says its HA Go app has reduced waiting times at specialist out-patient clinics with the vast majority of patients being able to leave within two hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We want to keep the patients and not make them stay in our specialist clinics for more than two hours, which was not optimum in the past, but now more than 80 percent of them can achieve this target," said Larry Lee, the Hospital Authority's manager of cluster performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launched in 2019, the app's functions include appointment booking and queue monitoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added the HA would continue to expand the app's functions, such as in the areas of telehealth and outreach services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority says the app has been downloaded over 3.3 million times and its user base has grown to more than 2.6 million.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician said on Sunday that teachers and parents should focus on helping children with special educational needs adapt to social settings, given that the pandemic had a profound impact on these children's physical and mental health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Patrick Ip, clinical professor at HKUMed, said his team found in their research with more than 1,000 children in Hong Kong that many with special educational needs lacked interaction and support during the pandemic and this has affected them since returning back to the classroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that additional support at school and at home is needed to help these children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this critical moment when children are returning to school again, we need to pay particular attention to all our children, in particular those with special educational needs, that we should not overemphasise on school examinations and too much pressure on academic performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, we should support them, back up actually to their resuming to the normal learning environment, and encourage them to actually engage in more recreational and also playful environmental activities so that they could get adapted to the new environment, to build up rapport with their peers and also to engage with their teachers and senior professionals much better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip advised parents to focus on their children's psychological well-being, by encouraging more outdoor activities and sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be aware about the needs of individual children. Let the parents to get involved in assessing and also following up of learning of the individual child, so that they could participate in all those support together with the school teachers, continue with some of the continued training and then understand the needs and emotions of the individual child with SEN also at the family setting," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And also to plan for some group activities together with the children and their peers, and try to go out with those little kids with special educational needs to do more recreational outdoor activities in order to soothe their stress and let the children get adapted to the new environment together with their parents."

 A community activist group on Sunday called on the government to make sure subdivided flat tenants find housing elsewhere if they are evicted because their homes fail to meet minimum living standards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call came after a government task force submitted suggestions on minimum living standards to Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, deputy director of the Society for Community Organization Sze Lai-shan said the group welcomes any measures to improve people's quality of living.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, she warned that people living in subdivided housing might have to relocate if new rules are brought in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, everyone wants to solve this problem. But they think about if they have this kind of standard, so some of them, they will be closed or they need to move out and then they need to modify it or renovate it," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are afraid they will be homeless."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as calling for the government to ensure such residents find new homes, Sze also said the city's public housing supply should be increased to alleviate the housing shortage.

    CE urged to support retail, social welfare sectors

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Propping up the retail industry and providing more support for the social welfare sector were among numerous appeals to Chief Executive John Lee as he held a town hall meeting in Mong Kok on Sunday to solicit views for his upcoming policy address.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens spoke in the two-hour televised forum, including a retail worker who proposed expanding the multiple-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents to other Greater Bay Area cities to attract more mainland tourists to Hong Kong, and consumption vouchers to boost spending locally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Spending is relatively weak. I hope the government can consider distributing local consumption vouchers to encourage residents to stay in Hong Kong to spend. Even if it's a small amount, it's still a gesture," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the CE acknowledged that some sectors are struggling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although our economy is growing, with the latest figure standing at three percent, challenges remain for certain industries in adapting to this transitional and reshuffling period," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Attracting people is definitely a policy of mine. We will discuss various ways to do this – whether they have been previously raised or they are new ideas – with the central government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some other issues covered focused on social welfare, including whether a three-tier system aimed at preventing suicides among school pupils will continue when it ends this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are assisting pupils who are in need and providing them with counselling services. This is correct and we will continue to do that. The mechanism will also be reviewed by the end of the year," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should also look into how to reduce the number of young people who are in need, including through personality development and raising their ability to handle issues. It's not easy, and this has to be done little by little."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a suggestion to set a minimum space standard for homes, the chief executive said the administration will tackle issues relating to living space and environment in the long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee is expected to deliver his third annual policy blueprint in October.

    A weaker HK dollar could boost retail sales: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that retail sales could improve in the latter part of this year on the back of a weakening Hong Kong dollar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan said an expected US interest rate cut may cause the Hong Kong dollar to weaken, making the SAR a more attractive location to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said upcoming major events should also bring in more tourists, creating a better outlook for retail sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said employment income is continuing to rise, which in turn should also support consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong should also improve competitiveness through the use of technology, and this would bring in new customers and consumption to strengthen the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the economic climate will remain stable for the rest of the year if exports continue to improve, coupled with a fall in external interest rates and improvement in investment sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said there would be risks to making a special loan guarantee scheme a long-term policy to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with cash flow issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 100 percent loan guarantee scheme was introduced as an extraordinary measure because of the pandemic. It now has more than HK$13 billion of bad debts. If it is implemented as a long-term measure, we need to be cautious, because it may involve moral hazards," he told reporters.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they had arrested 11 people who allegedly used Hong Kong as a base for phone scams involving the impersonation of customer service officers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force claims the suspects, who include six Malaysian nationals, are linked to a transnational syndicate responsible for the theft of HK$61 million in over 400 scams since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrests came after officers raided four offices in San Po Kong and Kowloon Bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 20 and 67, are accused of conspiracy to defraud, using false instruments, and money laundering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The locals were allegedly responsible for duties, such as renting the centres and providing the syndicate with a large number of local prepaid SIM cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force seized 87 model-pool devices,15 computers and over 80,000 prepaid SIM cards in the raids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Lee Chun-man of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said surveillance cameras had been installed in the centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is believed the cameras allowed senior members of the syndicate to monitor the operation, as well as the workers' performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee pointed out that the Malaysian suspects came to Hong Kong as tourists, and were paid around HK$10,000 to HK$16,000 each month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from being responsible for using falsified identification documents or travel documents to register SIM cards, their duties also included managing the modem-pool devices by changing SIM cards in the devices around the clock, so as to ensure that the telecommunication network could be operated 24 hours a day," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said that between May and August this year, three of the Malaysian suspects had allegedly made use of computer software to modify their passports and the ID cards of others, so as to complete the real-name registration for at least 300 SIM cards.

 Ocean Park said on Saturday that its animal care team had prepared a cub-scented doll for giant panda Ying Ying, before her twin babies reunite with her.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The mother giant panda gave birth to one female and one male cub last week, and the park's team has been closely monitoring the twins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on its social media page, the park said before reintroducing the babies to Ying Ying, she would be given a cub-scented doll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The doll can help Ying Ying stay familiar with the cub's scent, and also let the caretakers observe and evaluate Ying Ying’s behaviour when she interacts with the scented doll," it wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environment and Ecology Bureau on Saturday said it's not ruling out further action concerning Hong Kong's banning of aquatic products from Japan following wastewater discharges from the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In August last year, the SAR government gazetted a food safety order that banned aquatic products from 10 Japanese prefectures, after Japanese authorities released treated wastewater from the power plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on its social media, the bureau said the Japanese government had claimed that the water met international standards after being diluted and filtered, and it demanded the SAR government lift the import ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it had told the Japanese authorities that the release of wastewater was unprecedented, and there would be catastrophic consequences on marine ecology and food safety if there were any error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the government had to take precautionary measures, and it's not ruling out taking further action to safeguard the SAR's food safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the government will continue to observe the impact of the discharge, by looking at scientific data and reports by Japanese authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hang Seng Bank senior advisor George Leung on Saturday said he hopes to see an upturn in the here economy now that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, looks set to begin a cycle of interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The forecasted rate cuts, I believe, will help alleviate pressure on SME [small and medium enterprise] interest payments and this will have a relatively large impact when it comes to boosting the economy," he said on a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the time had come for the United States to start cutting interest rates, adding that his confidence had grown that the battle against inflation is on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said he expects the Fed to announce a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, and that its benchmark interest rate may be half a percentage point lower by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed held the rate at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, at its last meeting, for the eighth time in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said most bank loans here have interest rates priced off the interbank offered rate instead of the best lending rate. He said he expected this rate to come down once the Fed had cut its benchmark interest rate.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 40-year-old man remains in police custody after trying to ram his way out of a police roadblock on Friday night in Ho Man Tin, injuring a police officer. Speaking to the press on Saturday morning, the police said the man faces seven charges, including trafficking in dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a briefing with reporters, Superintendent Tsui Suk-yee said police received a report at 7 pm of a private car driving erratically in Kowloon City and Hung Hom and that red lights had allegedly been jumped and the vehicle driven in the opposite direction to the traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about 8 pm, officers found that the vehicle had come to a halt with the rest of the traffic on Princess Margaret Road, where police had put up a roadblock. Police said the vehicle then tried to ram its way free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The car allegedly hit a police officer and dragged him along the road but officers, who had drawn their guns, eventually detained the suspect. Four other private cars were also damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police strongly condemns the arrested man for disregarding the safety of road users and officers executing their duty. It's a very irresponsible act," Superintendent Tsui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers later found suspected drugs in the vehicle, including methamphetamine, crack cocaine and ketamine, with a total market value of over HK$20,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they also found a Hong Kong identity card which did not belong to the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui said the driver did not have a driving licence and the vehicle had been rented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial investigation, when the arrested person rented a car, he got a valid driving licence. However, until Friday, his driving license had been expired," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man was arrested on suspicion of taking conveyance without authority, furious driving, assaulting police officers, trafficking in dangerous drugs, possessing other's identity card, driving without a licence and driving without a third party risk insurance.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said the government will continue its work on raising living standards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a social media video message, Lee said consultation meetings will be held with different parties about his upcoming Policy Address, and he will also be going out into the community to hear suggestions from the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current-term government is committed to enhancing people's livelihoods. We implement in detail and make Hong Kong a better place for living and working," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We work hard in aspects of medical care, child care, transportation and housing, making Hong Kong a better place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured people from the transport sector, low income groups, and the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albert Leung from Citybus said after changing the tolls for Hong Kong's three harbour tunnels, traffic congestion at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel had been improved and it had also enhanced the competitiveness of buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A family living in a subdivided flat said they regularly visited the community living room, and there were teachers helping with homework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman living in Zhongshan on the mainland said the elderly health care voucher scheme had been expanded to cover more medical institutions in the Greater Bay Area, and this was more convenient for her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive will hold a second public consultation on the Policy Address on Sunday, alongside several ministers. The address itself will be delivered in October.

    'No plans to introduce 100pc loan guarantee for SMEs'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Saturday said the authorities have no plans to roll out a 100 percent loan guarantee scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) again.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced details about establishing a new task force to help SMEs deal with their loan payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government launched a special 100 percent loan guarantee scheme during the pandemic to help SMEs cope with cash flow problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, the minister said it was a "special measure" during the Covid-19 pandemic, and about HK$140 billion was approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy is gradually recovering now, if a 100 percent loan guarantee is maintained, it would be a great burden on the government. We will closely monitor the situation, but we don't have any plans to roll out the scheme again in the meantime," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said the government needs "careful consideration", as the default rate of the scheme reached 9.2 percent, which means the default amount was HK$13.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the SAR's economic and trade offices (ETOs) being suppressed by the United States and western countries, Yau said the government had a determined stance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were voices from the United States and western countries asking to shut down our ETOs. But we should continue with our work, and shouldn't retreat just because of some opinions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage, the ETOs are running normally. The countries still haven't had further action, so we shouldn't retreat. They're just scaring us, and we shouldn't kneel down."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Friday said it strongly disapproves and rejects what it described as biased reporting by the New York Times on the new National Security Exhibition Gallery at the Hong Kong History Museum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said an article headlined "A History Museum Shows How China Wants to Remake Hong Kong" carried false and misleading narratives against the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said the newspaper had “completely ignored the large-scale and incessant riots that occurred in 2019 and the very fact of the failed attempt to stage the Hong Kong version of 'colour-revolution', which have continuously devastated society, livelihood and economy of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It has also deliberately neglected the fact that the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community, and the business environment as well, to return to normalcy. The New York Times has demonstrated hypocrisy with double standards.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said visitors had been coming in droves to the gallery, with 10,000 entering by the end of its fourth day, and that it had received positive reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The untruthful reporting of the New York Times article about the gallery is completely out of order and twisting the facts,” the spokesman added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer was injured during an operation on Princess Margaret Road on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video circulating online, swarms of officers had surrounded a northbound silver vehicle opposite Hung Hom Divisional Police Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of them had drawn their guns and demanded the driver pull over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the driver refused to cooperate, and tried to break free from the road block by jolting back and forth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver eventually came to a halt after colliding with another vehicle, before being apprehended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One officer who was hit in the waist was helped up by other colleagues, and led onto a police van.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second driver caught in the incident suffered neck injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All northbound lanes of the major thoroughfare were sealed off at around 8.40pm, causing severe traffic disruption.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed the success of his administration in attracting foreign talent and businesses to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video message as part of his Policy Address consultation, Mr Lee said officials have gone all out to look for new opportunities over the past year, despite facing many challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Hong Kong is going through economic transformation, we have continuously strengthened our efforts to grab talent and attract enterprises and capital to Hong Kong," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With a special focus on innovation and technology, we pursue development in new quality productive forces and reinforce our status as an international financial centre, aviation hub and trade centre. We will build Hong Kong into a global hub for high-calibre talent and strive for economic growth and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured a number of people who decided to set up shop in Hong Kong recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Daniel Seah, the chief executive of Los Angeles-based Digital Domain, an Oscar-winning production house specialising in visual effects for movies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I deal with officials in Hong Kong, they are clear about what this place needs. They are also clear about what our company needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A research and development base is most crucial for a company, especially for us since we are built on technology."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of July, Hong Kong has engaged over 100 strategic and innovation and technology enterprises which agreed to set up or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have generated investment of HK$52 billion and created more than 15,000 jobs.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 65 national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics – most of them gold medallists – will visit Hong Kong next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They include diving duo Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, winners of the women's synchronised 10m platform, as well as table tennis champions such as Ma Long, Fan Zhendong and Sun Yingsha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also among the list are swimmer Zhang Yufei, who won six medals in Paris, breaking bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, as "671", and street skateboarder Cui Chenxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the nation's first Olympic tennis champion, Zheng Qinwen, will not be on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes from 16 sports will be joined by eight coaches, and led by director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan. They will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong from August 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will attend a gala show before showcasing their skills at two demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park swimming pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for all three events were sold out in about half an hour on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will also attend a reception and a banquet hosted by the SAR government, and meet local athletes at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, before heading to neighbouring Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team bagged 40 gold medals at the Paris Games, on top of 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

    Calls to better protect digital platform workers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Unionists are calling for a committee to be set up as part of efforts to better protect digital platform workers. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767368_1_20240823162510.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A union group has called on the government to do more to protect the rights of digital platform workers after pointing to a survey that it said highlighted their plight, especially those who suffered work-related injuries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, who's also chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, proposed setting up a committee to allow workers to better reflect their views and give them greater bargaining power, similar to what Singapore has done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said government officials, employer and employee representatives as well as union members could sit on the committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their [the workers'] representatives can participate in the committee and they can discuss the details, for example the amount of each order, and... the time limit of receiving the order online," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent survey jointly conducted by the group and the Federation of Hong Kong Transportation and Logistics Industry Unions, just under a quarter of about 360 interviewees – who are mainly courier or food delivery workers – said they had been injured at work, but only 13 percent of them received compensation and most were not satisfied with the amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions said the workers lack bargaining power because a majority of them are self-employed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam also pointed out that even though some companies would purchase casualty insurance, it is not enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that the Labour Department and the government can encourage the platform companies to purchase the insurance, maybe the compensation is similar to the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, to provide better protection and compensation, to also include, for example, support them for the medical treatment in hospitals or clinics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said the authorities should also look into requiring the companies to offer workers retirement protection.

    Faulty confirmations behind hospital feeding tube case

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An “uncommon” false pH test result and an inaccurate medical image were to blame for a blunder at Queen Elizabeth Hospital involving a patient's feeding tube being inserted into his airway and left undetected in June this year, hospital bosses said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They also said the 61-year-old male patient, who was paralysed, remained under intensive care in a critical state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital in Yau Ma Tei said a nurse replaced the nasogastric tube for the patient in an orthopaedic ward as part of normal procedures on June 16, before another nurse reinserted the apparatus the same evening. But the patient's condition deteriorated around a day later, with doctors finding the tube in his left bronchus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Kam-shing, a doctor who led a root cause analysis panel, said the medics had performed pH tests and an X-ray to check the position of the tube, before proceeding to feed the patient fluids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sample tested came back acidic, which normally means the nasogastric tube is in the stomach, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, which is a little bit uncommon, the nasogastric tube has gone via the left bronchus into the left pleural space, which is the space between the lungs and the thoracic cage," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of [the patient's] chest infection, there is some fluid accumulating in the pleural cavity, which is probably infected. When the pleural fluid is probably infected, it will become acidic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who's also the chief executive of Kwong Wah Hospital, said the houseman checking the X-ray was likely inexperienced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the things that usually the doctor will look at is the tip of the nasogastric tube. Whenever it is in a standard position, then it is one of the factors that we can use to judge whether the nasogastric tube is in the correct space," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, because the chest X-ray doesn't show clearly the tip of the nasogastric tube, we think that the doctor involved probably doesn't have enough clinical experience to make sure that the nasogastric tube is indeed in the correct space."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for why the tube was left undetected, Tang said patients normally would show symptoms only after one to two litres had been accumulated in the cavity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel suggested reviewing the Hospital Authority's internal guidelines on inserting nasogastric tubes and consider whether to perform an X-ray examination on high-risk patients before feeding them liquids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also proposed having the attending doctor review previous clinical results in complicated circumstances, as well as coming up with a more standardised medical imaging procedure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung, Queen Elizabeth Hospital's chief executive, apologised to the patient and his family, saying authorities would follow up on the panel's suggestions as soon as possible and provide training and assessment to the medics involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the houseman should be held accountable, Cheung said the doctor was part of the team and that "the responsibility ultimately lies with the hospital".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The houseman had finished the internship at the orthopaedic unit and officials would follow up according to the panel's report and established procedures, he added.

 The Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Arthur Yuen, will lead a new task force to look into small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are having trouble with banks over their loan repayments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This task force was formed in response to calls from small businesses urging lenders to stop requesting early repayments or recalling loans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting with representatives from the Hong Kong Association of Banks on Friday morning, HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said the new body would aim at helping individual SMEs resolve their funding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Each case has its own background and uniqueness, and each case could be handled differently. I would encourage business chambers or companies to refer cases to the Authority immediately, if they hear or see any firms having difficulties, so that they can be dealt with by the task force and resolved with banks quickly,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another press briefing, the co-chairperson of the task force, Arthur Yuen, said the HKMA has received only a small number of complaints from SMEs which required its intervention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen added the banking sector has been supporting SMEs, noting that lenders have allowed around 4,000 small businesses to delay their loan repayments since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said a potential interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next month could help struggling small firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest burden that they (SMEs) are facing right now is perhaps much higher than three years ago,” he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's really an expectational issue, the forward-looking, where interest rates are heading that would help banks in assessing the repayment ability of a corporate model, including SMEs, because then they will have the interest rate outlook. They fit the interest rate outlook into their credit models, and that would definitely be helpful.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In face of concerns over the tightening policy of property loans, Yuen said the HKMA has urged lenders to complete their vetting requests for such loans within two weeks, unless applicants fail to provide the adequate information needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) welcomed the establishment of the task force, saying the new group would help SMEs in acquiring capital and promoting Hong Kong's economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, BPA lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said small businesses still need more support to overcome these difficult times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government may consider restarting the 100 percent guaranteed loan and also the payment holiday scheme. That is just pay the interest without repaying the principal, like for a period of 12 months," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all hope that (in) 2025, things will improve. And I hope as the economic situation improves, cash flow for the companies will also improve."

    'More support, funding needed for HK Esports'

<div class="itemFullText">
 More support is needed for talented Hong Kong gamers who often have to pay their own way to compete overseas, said the founding president of the Esports Association of Hong Kong, China on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eric Yeung made the comment after 16-year-old Cheng Yip-kai took home the city's first Pokémon GO world championship title after booking his own trip to Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now unfortunately, most of the games are commercially running for those competitions, rather than [falling] within the traditional sports framework," he told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think it's a bit difficult [using] the traditional funding way to fund them and to support them to go to compete [against] others internationally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said Esports can be integrated with other industries to drive growth, noting the lack of a professional league and competitions in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Esports itself is not a standalone industry. But rather, in Hong Kong we could work closely together with the innovation and technology industry as well as the traditional sport industry in order to groom a better result for the Esports industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yeung said the success of blockbuster game "Wukong" - or "Monkey King" - marked a milestone for China's Esports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game, based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, is the first triple-A video game in the country's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major difference [between] those AAA games and those traditional Esports games is the investment. When we are talking about the AAA level games, it's like shooting a movie - we're talking about maybe even hundreds of millions dollars of investment for a single game," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investment for a traditional mobile game is much lower."

    Plan to upgrade Alibaba's HK listing approved

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Shareholders of e-commerce giant Alibaba approved a plan to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767339_1_20240823123627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Alibaba on Friday said it would upgrade its Hong Kong-listed shares to primary status, opening it up to China's huge army of investors that could potentially rake in billions of dollars for the firm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision by shareholders during its annual general meeting on Thursday will provide a much-needed boost to the firm, which has underperformed the market in recent years due to to weak consumption and after a crackdown by Beijing on the tech industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to announce that the voluntary conversion of our secondary listing to primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will become effective on August 28, 2024," the company announced on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, which is also listed in New York, had flagged the idea two years ago amid worries about a regulatory drive by US authorities as tensions simmered between Beijing and Washington, though that was later put off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba has been primarily traded in New York since 2014 and remained dual-listed after its notable return to Hong Kong through a second listing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the firm's shares in Hong Kong are down about 75 percent from their peak in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A conversion to primary status in Hong Kong could pave way for Alibaba to enter a cross-border scheme that allows investors in Shenzhen and Shanghai to trade Hong Kong-listed shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would open it up to China's more than 200 million investors and could see capital inflows of up to US$19.5 billion in the first six months of inclusion, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba this month reported a 29 percent fall in quarterly profit as it battles sluggish activity among China's consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uncertainty about Alibaba's future development has persisted since Beijing scuttled a planned initial public offering of the company's financial services arm, Ant Group, in late 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancelled listing -- which would likely have been the biggest in history -- was followed a month later by an announcement that Alibaba was under formal investigation in China for alleged monopolistic practices. (AFP)

    'Replace Covid facilities with carpark at cruise port'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jeff Bent has revised his earlier forecast and says Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767319_1_20240823104145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on Friday called for the government to remove unused Covid facilities near the site and build an open-air carpark to improve transport links to the facility.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jeff Bent, the managing director of World Wide Cruise Terminals, was commenting on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme after the terminal welcomed the only cruise ship to dock there this month, the Norwegian Spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent revised his earlier forecast and said Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we're expecting about 100 total ship calls... The cruise business is going to be slow this year and next, as we work our way out of the post-Covid trough," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used to have a home-based carrier, a cruise line based in Hong Kong that went out of business and Hong Kong saved its air carrier. We did not save our cruise line... We're now sort of dealing with cruise lines that come from time to time and on occasion, but are not year round based here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent said the unused Covid facilities were a "detraction" of the cruise terminal, and the government should remove them and make use of the land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Where all those Covid facilities are now, it would be quite easy to have a large open-air carpark there. I think at a minimum, that would be a big boon because we know that 45 percent of Hong Kong people who take a cruise have a car. Eighty-five percent of those would like to drive themselves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If those people can drive themselves, then they will not be fighting for a limited taxi supply with the out-of-town guests. So there are some quick fixes that should be put in place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government could allow cab drivers to impose a surcharge for pick-ups at the terminal to attract more taxis to the port.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Thursday said the giant panda twins born a week ago were gradually stabilising and gaining weight, with the animal's iconic black patches starting to show on parts of the cubs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it also said the pair remained fragile and were being monitored by mainland experts and the park's animal care team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said the female cub weighs around 172 grammes and her younger brother about 168 grammes, and black spots were "vaguely visible" on their eyes, ears and shoulders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are both feeding and defecating normally under the assistance of experts from the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. The twin cubs are also displaying healthy appetites by drinking up to 10 grammes of milk per meal, six times per day," Ocean Park said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the two cubs are stabilising, they are still fragile and are under 24-hour intensive care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said caretakers were supporting the mother panda, Ying Ying, with her post-labour recovery, and experts were trying to milk her for the cubs to consume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying has been improving her caring and nursing behaviours, the park added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth to the twins last Thursday, which was also the eve of her 19th birthday, or the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It is up to the Hong Kong Jockey Club to call the shots on how to use a parcel of land it owns in upmarket Happy Valley, the government said on Thursday, after the non-profit body was given the green light to redevelop its sports complex there into a residential site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But a lawmaker said the charity and gaming organisation should provide details on the intended use of housing blocks at 48 Shan Kwong Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Buildings Department had in June approved the club's plan for constructing three 21-storey residential buildings with a total gross floor area of nearly 486,000 square feet, as well as a block to offer recreational facilities for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau said the site was brought by the body through public auction, and that the lease did not have any restrictions on its land use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Jockey Club is not required to apply for modifying its lease or pay a land premium to construct residential buildings on the site," the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is the Jockey Club's decision, as a private land owner, whether and when to develop the site for residential purposes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site was occupied by two stable blocks in the 1930s, before it was rezoned for residential purposes in 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club had periodically applied to renew the site's use as a recreational facility since then. The sports complex houses facilities such as tennis and squash courts, a golf simulation room, and fitness studios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmaker Andrew Lam noted the organisation owed the general public an explanation on the project, which he said had attracted a lot of attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are guessing [whether] the Jockey Club would be renting [out] the flats or even selling the flats to the general public...it attracts a lot of queries and concerns," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club was recently asked by the Town Planning Board to "actively implement" the zoned use of the site as originally designated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In securing the extension of the temporary planning permit this year, the organisation "had committed to redevelop the site into a residential cum sports complex, subject to further studies to be undertaken".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said he will unveil measures to address substandard living conditions in subdivided flats at the appropriate time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his Facebook page, Lee said he has received a report from a task force looking into subdivided flats, after officials wrapped up their research and gathered views from different stakeholders over the past 10 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report from the task force includes suggestions for minimum living standards and ways to replace this type of housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an official statement, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the task force, said the government is expected to provide 308,000 public housing units in the upcoming decade and these homes could offer a solution to long-existing subdivided housing issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that his task force will submit a follow-up report within one month, as instructed by the CE.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A specialist in family medicine on Thursday called on people to consult both a family doctor and a Chinese medicine practitioner once a year for regular check ups, adding that preventive care could lessen the burden on medical staff.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Liberal Party conducted a telephone questionnaire with more than 2,000 people over the past two months, in the hope of strengthening collaboration between Chinese and Western medical practitioners to better serve the public, and 70 percent said they would accept this medical partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Billy Chiu, a member of the party, said this "one plus one is greater than two" method of seeing two different practitioners could increase the chance of catching medical conditions early on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the aim is to do preventive care, so definitely with preventive care doing better, then obviously the percentage [of those] going to hospital will be much lower, so that will lead to less manpower demand inside the hospital," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the Hong Kong government's direction [on developing] the primary care commission and also 18 district health centres, I think we are looking forward to the outcome and also for the efficiency of increasing all these primary care preventive service models so with that, fewer people will go to inpatient [facilities] so the staff, the manpower planning, all this can be reviewed much efficiently."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chiu said that promoting collaboration could also allow for better communication and teamwork between the two medical fields when treating the same patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, I think many people, even including healthcare people, when we are not familiar about, for example, the drug interaction of Western medicine and herbs, so we simply tell people not to mix together or separate by four hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But actually with more evidence we know that some Chinese medicine and also Western medicine when taken together, we can see the more beneficial effect. Number two, [Chinese medicine] actually alleviates the side effects of some of the Western medicine."

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR passengers can ride on a replica of the rail operator's first-generation trains from Thursday, as part of the company's 45th anniversary celebrations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The train will run on various lines until the end of the year and will be showcased at Choi Hung Station on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has the red and white front of the first-generation trains, as well as the MTR logo from back in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inside there are the ball-shaped straphangers of old, and an orange-yellow ceiling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lighting has also been adjusted to a yellowish colour to give passengers a sense that they are travelling back in time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aaron was among hundreds of train enthusiasts who boarded the inaugural train at Choi Hung on Thursday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first time we saw the train we [thought] that it is quite [similar] to what we saw [in] the historical photos," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fan told RTHK that the ball-shaped shapehangers felt better on the hand compared to the red-coloured handles used on other trains.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday hailed a cooperation project between Hong Kong and Thailand aimed at promoting the use of electric vehicles (EVs) and green transport in the Southeast Asian country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a ceremony to kick off a partnership between the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) and Thai energy company Spark, Chan said that while the SAR is not known for mass EV production, its tech community is able to create innovative solutions for the vehicles and other new energy applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is proud to assist Thailand in its green transformation, using cutting-edge technologies developed by our tech firms, and contributing our know-how, innovation, expertise and experience,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This high-profile, international project is a brilliant showcase of our green technological capabilities. It reinforces Hong Kong's aspirations and prospects to become an international green tech and green finance centre.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the partnership is only the beginning of more collaborations with Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries in the green, smart mobility field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC’s CEO Clara Chan noted that the investment is the corporation’s first overseas initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government-owned investment vehicle aspires to help Spark become one of the top three EV charging brands in Thailand by 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To recap, as patient capital, the HKIC has been carrying out due mandate, namely to seek reasonable financial return over the medium to long term, and more importantly, to enhance the long term competitiveness and economic vitality of Hong Kong,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clara Chan said the HKIC's investments have been focused on a diversified range of fields, including core technology, biotechnology, new energy and green technology, spanning companies at various stages of development and from around the world.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets to local demonstrations by mainland Olympians who did well at the Paris Games were all snapped up in a little more than half an hour on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were some 5,000 tickets available for the public to go to two demonstrations on August 31, and a gala show the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The events are part of a three-day visit by the delegation to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people joined an online queue for the HK$20 tickets when they went on sale at 10am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two demonstrations, at Victoria Park Swimming Pool and Queen Elizabeth Stadium, will feature divers, swimmers, gymnasts, as well as table tennis and badminton players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said those who bought the tickets need to collect them at URBTIX outlets or from self-service ticketing kiosks on or before August 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After departing Hong Kong, members of the national team will spend three days in Macau.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven people, including the chairman and an executive director of a listed company, have been arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in connection with a fraud case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The investigation revealed that the chairman of the listed company and other individuals had allegedly falsified business documents and accounting records of the company's subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macau, while the company's trade receivables totalling over MOP$113 million (about HK$110 million) were reduced,” the ICAC said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Meanwhile, the individuals concerned had also allegedly used false documents and accounting records to conceal the misappropriation of the company's funds over HK$9 million.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said it had teamed up with the Securities and Futures Commission to search six premises earlier this week and arrested the seven individuals involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees had allegedly committed the offence of agent using documents with intent to deceive his principal under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macau police also searched the company's offices in Macau and interviewed individuals as part of their investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC added the investigation was ongoing and it would not make further comments on the case.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary golfer Gary Player, who won more than 160 professional tournaments over a career that spanned seven decades, will feature at the Fanling course in November as an ambassador of the LINK Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South African player hailed the tournament as “Asia’s Major”, marking “golf's development in China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Taichi Kho, the first player from the SAR to win on the Asian Tour, said he was excited to return to his home Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s the event I've been looking forward to the whole year and whether I play well or not, I know everyone has my back and I feel so much support from the local crowd and the Hong Kong Golf Club and everyone involved,” said Kho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think golf is a sport that comes and goes. Sometimes you score well and sometimes you don't. But I feel very proud of the fact that I've been able to stay focused all year and stay disciplined to do what I set out to do.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So it hasn't surprised me that my golf has come along nicely the second half of the year and I look forward to continuing that momentum into the final stretch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year’s champion, Ben Campbell of New Zealand, will also play to defend his title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Open will take place from November 21 to 24, featuring a prize purse of US$2 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A delegation from Polytechnic University has won nine awards at the Silicon Valley International Inventions Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A cardiac monitoring device that's a tiny, light, wireless and wearable patch garnered two awards, including the semi-grand prize and a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Zheng Zijian, who led the research team behind the patch, said the device is as accurate as the machines used in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our permeable electronic skin, [electrocardiogram] electronic skin is the first of its kind that allows ICU-grade accuracy for long-term wearable… The permeability is superb, so that you can allow for long-term and accurate monitoring,” Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So for the next phase, we're working with the industries, venture capitalists, and trying to commercialise our technologies.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A nighttime brace designed to help teenagers with scoliosis earned a special prize issued by the Korea Invention Promotion Association, as well as a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Joanne Yip, who led the research team involved, said the brace could be commercialised next year and could sell for about HK$3,000 to HK$4,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our product, this nighttime brace, is the first one in the world using textile and soft robotics to provide early intervention for the patients with scoliosis. I can say this product is actually designed based on the patient's will, that we want to give them a more comfortable, but yet effective treatment,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are recruiting patients in Hong Kong for the clinical trial… We want to commercialise next year and because I think the cost is not too high, so it's affordable for patients and their families.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  University vice-president Professor Christopher Chao said this was the second time PolyU had joined the technology exhibition in the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the main purpose was to help the research teams and startups understand the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They need to understand more about the market and also the investment ecosystem more, otherwise all these startup companies may not be able to be successful. In fact, this is sometimes even more important than the technology itself,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday announced that its first-half net profit for 2024 dropped three percent year-on-year to HK$6.13 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's bourse operator said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$4.36 per share, three percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, HKEX said net income for the second quarter, covering April to June, rose nine percent to HK$3.16 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were supported by the growth in trading and clearing fees from higher volumes across the cash, derivatives and commodities markets, according to HKEX's earnings statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKEX's Chief Executive Bonnie Chan said sentiment appears to be on the mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, while macro-environment uncertainties persist, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year," she added. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six smart vending machines along the Wan Chai harbourfront are now in operation, selling grab-and-go snacks and beverages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following a soft launch on Wednesday, people can order ice cream, popcorn, candyfloss and drinks from the self-service, unattended machines between 7am and 11pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities are hoping to provide such services round-the-clock in future, but did not offer a timetable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the soft launch period, we will monitor the visitor flow and see if there is anything that we can do better elsewhere along the harbour," said the Development Bureau's senior engineer, Phoebe Wu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brendan, 6, was among the first to try the machines and told RTHK: "I just got ice cream and popcorn... I think they need like 100 kinds of flavours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist surnamed Bleazard said the prices for food and beverages, which are between HK$18 and HK$35, were reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The vending machine is good because you don't have to talk to anyone. You just choose what you want and you pay and you go,” he said. "Otherwise, you have to wait for the person, and hope they're open."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kiosks are part of an initiative announced in this year's budget to introduce food and beverages, retail and entertainment services on a pilot basis at “suitable harbourfront locations”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is hoping to introduce similar facilities along the promenade in East Kowloon by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Sports Institute is reviewing a funding scheme for athletes, with an outcome expected early next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as debate continues as to whether the city's athletes earn enough to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government has been working to provide a more supportive environment to our athletes, so they can better train, compete and enjoy a good career path after retirement," Lee said at a reception for SAR Olympians at government headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Authorities have been in close contact with the sports institute and sports associations to strengthen the subsidy schemes and training regimes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on Facebook afterwards, Lee said Hong Kong is proud of every Olympian, "whether they won a medal or not".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foil fencer Ryan Choi reignited the debate on athlete funding on Tuesday when he posted details of an unnamed teammate's income and expenditure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the fencer received a monthly allowance of HK$7,130 while having to shoulder costs for competing overseas, including air fares, accommodation and registration fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I only want to shed light on the situation faced by some of my teammates, and hope they'll receive better treatment," he said in another online post on Wednesday, before removing both posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the reception, the president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, Timothy Fok, said more events are in the pipeline to make sure the athletes remain in the limelight after the Paris Games.

    Housing Society to put rents up by 10 percent

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Society on Wednesday announced 10 percent rent increases for residents of the 20 public estates it operates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Each household will see a rise of at least HK$230 per month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes come into effect in October, but tenants will be given a three-month waiver given the current economic situation of Hong Kong, the society said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The public housing body is envisaging a revenue loss of almost HK$24 million due to the waiver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The society stressed that in increasing rents, it has taken into account how much tenants can afford to pay, along with its financial needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it has incurred an operational loss over the past two years due to rising maintenance costs and it expects further losses in the next two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the new rent levels will remain unchanged until the next review in 2026.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students who got to meet Hong Kong's Olympians in person on Wednesday said they learnt a valuable lesson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sharing session, which followed an open-top bus parade by the athletes, took place behind closed doors inside government headquarters in Tamar and lasted about half an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlie, who trains in track and field, said she found out what it takes to become an elite athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a great opportunity for us student athletes to have a better understanding of how high, elite-level athletes, how they compete, what they prepare mentally, physically and also maybe psychologically on such a big stage, the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it's a great experience for us to know more about the profession, and also it allows us to be more motivated for our own respective sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the session, the athletes headed outdoors to meet fans who had been waiting at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey drew cheers everywhere she went, and she stopped to sign autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians then gathered on the lawn for a photo with some primary school pupils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes' packed schedule was set to continue in the afternoon with a lunch hosted by Chief Executive John Lee, followed by a joint reception by the SAR government and the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China.

 The Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics on Wednesday received a hero's welcome around town, with excited fans braving the rain to applaud the athletes on board two open-top buses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 90-minute parade featured members of the team such as Paris gold medallist and fencing queen Vivian Kong and swimming star Siobhan Haughey, who took home two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's only two-time Olympic champion, fencer Edgar Cheung, did not attend the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two buses carrying the star-studded delegation set off from the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Sha Tin and passed by Tai Wai MTR station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier, considered the best viewing locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shirley, one of hundreds of onlookers, voiced her support for the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All athletes are worthy of our attention, because everyone has to put in time and effort. Not just the champions and runners-up, but all Hong Kong athletes. They all deserve our applause," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Su was part of the enthusiastic crowds in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so excited. It was amazing. I yelled the loudest at the scene. I cheered for Vivian Kong, Siobhan Haughey, and Hong Kong. I told Vivian Kong not to cry, and to give us smiles," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dan, who's from California, said: "I think it's great. Hong Kong needs to support its athletes and its sports people more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a good way to meet the people of Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes received roaring applause as they arrived at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alice, 11, said she got an autograph from Haughey towards the end of the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that she is very perseverant. When she sets a goal, she won't give up. I also swim, so we are kind of the same person," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The athletes] did a great job and I want them to keep going and never give up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR team bagged two gold and two bronze medals at the Paris Games.

  The monastery in Ngong Ping, which looks after stray dogs, said staff are still searching for two missing dogs named Dai Mui and Sai Mui.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Tuesday said it opposes a report by Bloomberg which quoted US firms as saying they were concerned about the city’s proposed new legislation to enhance cybersecurity of critical infrastructures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bloomberg said in its report earlier that some US tech firms had warned that the proposed cyber regulations could grant the SAR government “unusual access” to their computer systems; and giving authorities “overly broad powers” could threaten the integrity of service providers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article also said the American Chamber of Commerce and Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce have also submitted letters during the public consultation period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR administration called Bloomberg’s report biased, saying it had taken the views of the submissions out of context.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the one-month consultation of the legislative framework ended on August 1, the HKSAR Government received 53 submissions, in which 52 submissions supported the legislation and made constructive suggestions, including those from the Asia Internet Coalition, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,” a government statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The proposed legislative framework only concerns protecting the Critical Computer Systems (CCSs) of the Critical Infrastructure Operators (CIOs), which in no way involves the personal data and business information.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It pointed out that similar legislation already exists in other jurisdictions, such as the mainland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the European Union and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “CIOs have the responsibility of properly responding to cyberattacks. Only when a CIO is unwilling or unable to respond to an incident on its own would the Commissioner's Office consider applying to a Magistrate for a warrant to connect to the CCSs or install programmes in the CCSs in view of necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and public interest,” the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the administration will continue to engage industry stakeholders in formulating the legislative regime and the related Codes of Practice.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="One of the trip's highlights was meeting Liu Yang (centre, front row), China's first female astronaut. Photo: Handout" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766922_1_20240820181655.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty secondary students who recently returned from a young astronaut training camp have described their experience as rewarding and inspirational, saying they hope to follow in the footsteps of China's astronauts and make history one day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The teenagers were selected from a pool of around 200 applicants and went through a rigorous screening process, with three rounds of interviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over nine days from late July, they visited the Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Gansu province and the National Time Service Centre in Xi'an.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They even got a chance to meet Liu Yang, China's first female astronaut who was part of the Shenzhou-9 mission in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 20 of the students met the press at the Space Museum in Tsim Sha Tsui on Tuesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Alex Ngan, who said he was impressed by the progress achieved by the nation on space exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We went from a satellite that could only know how to repeat one singular song to a space station - it's simply unthinkable," the year eight student from the Canadian International School of Hong Kong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To see the sites that these historic events unfolded and to actually hear from the professionals that work in this field is an amazing experience and I will remember it forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng Tin-ho, a secondary five student from Tsang Pik Shan Secondary School, was touched by the professionalism of workers at the space centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They work in very remote locations, far away from their families and had to endure extreme temperature changes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But they remain dedicated, devoting their lives to what they are most passionate about. I hope I can do the same in the future and contribute to society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest tour was fully sponsored by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now in its 13th edition, the training camp admits 30 students every year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the United Front Work Department has stressed that the continuous development of the One Country, Two Systems principle in Hong Kong is playing an important role in China's reunification.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a speech at a conference held in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Shi Taifeng said the SAR is key to the country's reunification efforts, adding that compatriots in the city have all along loved the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The continuous development of the implementation of One Country, Two Systems in Hong Kong will provide important reference and play an important role realising the complete reunification of the motherland," Shi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are more confident and capable than ever before to realise the nation's reunification."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Politburo member said that "Taiwan independence" is a dead-end and the initiative to resolve the Taiwan issue has always been on the side of the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current situation across the Taiwan Strait is complex," Shi said in the speech at the Overseas Chinese World Conference for Promoting Peaceful Reunification of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anti-China forces in the West have resorted to any means to inhibit China's development and intensified their efforts to use Taiwan to contain China. The Democratic Progressive Party has been stubbornly insisting on 'Taiwan independence' and inciting cross-strait confrontation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of Beijing's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, said seeking reunification is an aspiration of the Chinese people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History has shown that all attempts to oppose China and seek independence would not succeed. When it comes to safeguarding national unity, no one should misjudge the country's firm determination and strong capabilities," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, for his part, called on people to "tell the good story of China's reunification".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's success since its return to the motherland has fully demonstrated that One Country, Two Systems is a good system for solving problems left over by history, and for promoting world peace and development," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 1,200 people attended the conference in Hong Kong, the second time the SAR has held the event.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures released on Tuesday showed that overall consumer prices in Hong Kong rose by 2.5 percent last month compared with the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That inflation figure was larger than the corresponding increase of 1.5 percent in June and was the highest since November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed higher inflation data to the end of concessionary measures for ratepayers in June, and a rise in transport costs to and from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term. Domestic costs may face some moderate upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties," a government spokesman added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers are being urged to be more supportive of gamers, after a teenager from the SAR was crowned the world’s best Pokémon trainer this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng Yip-kai, who played under the username of “yekai0904”, took home Hong Kong's first Pokémon GO World Championship title and a US$20,000 prize after pulling off a 3-1 win against a Dutch opponent in the grand final in Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng, 16, who bowed out early in last year’s competition in Japan, said in a post-match interview that his victory was proof of his dedication to the game and had been a chance to prove himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former Hong Kong Pokémon Go team leader, Sam Cheung, told RTHK that there are currently about 50 active competitive players of the mobile game in the city and Cheng was the SAR’s sole representative this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Cheng had received criticism and insults following his early elimination last year, but showed his resilience with a victorious comeback this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he hoped Cheng’s success will change what people think of gamers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If you watch any live streaming of the Pokémon GO World Championship, you could see on many occasions Cheng used fluent Mandarin and English to do interviews. This shows that he could sharpen his language skills while playing video games. I believe if parents read Cheng’s story they will change how they view gamers,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lai Ching-lung from the University of Hong Kong sponsored Cheng's trip to Japan last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was happy to learn about the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai added that he hopes more people will participate in Pokémon GO and help pay for young gamers to compete overseas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials say safety inspections have been ordered at Eastern Hospital after two pieces of concrete and part of a false ceiling came down in one of its wards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nobody was injured in the incident in the integrated medical and geriatric male ward at around 8.15pm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the pieces of concrete were 20 centimetres long, 30 centimetres wide and three centimetres thick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceiling was repaired and the ward is operating as usual, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital is very concerned about the incident and has arranged safety inspections to the facilities in the ward again immediately. The hospital is investigating the cause of concrete spalling," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital has regular inspection of hospital facilities and the last inspection at this area was in April last year."

 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, on Tuesday recorded the first senior Grand Slam victory of his career, after beating Chile's Cristian Garin in the first qualifying round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong went a set down, 4-6, before fighting back 7-6, 6-3 for the victory against Garin, who's now ranked 116th in the world but was once as high as 17th in 2021 and made it the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China player is currently ranked 38 spots lower than the Chilean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong will next play Chinese Taipei's Hsu Yu-hsiou in the second round of qualifiers. Hsu is ranked 185th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are three rounds of qualifiers in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The draw for the main round of the men's singles will be made at Friday midnight, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Wong won the Australian Open junior doubles title two years ago.
