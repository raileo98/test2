    Consumer watchdog warns of hidden fees at pet hotels

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pet owners should study the fine print carefully when choosing a lodging for their furry friends and avoid those which are unlicensed, according to the Consumer Council.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council randomly selected 18 licensed pet hotels across Hong Kong for study earlier this year. Only five had their fee structures published online, meaning consumers had to make enquiries, a process which could be tedious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different operators also had varying charging schemes. Some charged up to double the normal rate during peak periods such as the Lunar New Year holiday, while the administering of medicines or nutritional supplements all came at a cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the event of injury, illness or even death, only four hotels would provide compensation of between HK$300 and HK$5,000. Eight others stated they would assume no legal liability through disclaimers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart form urging pet hotel operators to be more transparent in their fee structures, the watchdog also hoped the government could amend the rules so that all licensed animal boarding providers were published on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, the council conducted a survey of private camping sites in Hong Kong and found that nearly 40 percent of them were suspected of operating illegally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only three of the 22 venues covered in the study carried a proper licence or compliance certificate to operate a holiday camp. Authorities were verifying if any operator had breached rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council also studied another seven "glamping" sites which provide extra amenities. Only three were covered by third-party liability insurance, meaning people staying at other sites may not have adequate protection in case of emergencies or accidents.

    Government plans to raise university tuition fees

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Christine Choi says it is important to maintain fiscal discipline while ensuring that universities receive adequate funding. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757765_1_20240617124143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Education Christine Choi on Monday said the government plans to raise university tuition fees in the next few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local undergraduate students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions pay an annual tuition fee of HK$42,100 – an amount that has remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, Choi said a fee increase for such students will be implemented in stages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After all these years... there's been 40 percent inflation, but we haven't raised tuition fees at all. So we think it's time for a review and to maintain fiscal discipline," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the government will make an announcement in advance so that universities can introduce more grants and bursaries for students in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the minister said she expects more institutions to offer applied degree programmes that combine theory and practical skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his policy address last year to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for post-secondary education and to facilitate the establishment of universities of applied sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi stressed that each university has its own strengths, so there should be a division of labour regarding the courses they offer in the future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of rush-hour commuters had to be evacuated from an MTR train on Monday morning, after a 40-centimetre snake was seen slithering through one of the carriages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they were notified at around 7:30am that a black and white snake was spotted on a Tsuen Wan Line train that was approaching Admiralty station from Central.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All passengers were asked to disembark at Admiralty, and no one was injured in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A snake catcher was called in soon after, and the serpent – believed to be a nonvenomous California Kingsnake – was captured and sent to Kadoorie Farm.

    Better labelling for air purifiers needed: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday called on manufacturers of air purifiers to clearly indicate how much clean air their products can deliver per minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said clearly stating the clean air delivery rate would help buyers make better choices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council tested 10 air purifiers, and found big differences in their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best performing model was 12.3 times better than the worst at removing formaldehyde, while variations in their effectiveness in removing smoke ranged up to 2.7 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said the clean air delivery rate could act as a convenient metric for consumers to compare different air purifier models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because the standards of filtration is quite different among different countries, no matter it is dust or pollens or cigarette smoke, it's quite diverse,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is easier for consumers to compare based on the CADR - the clean air delivery rate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health reminded consumers to clean their purifiers regularly to minimise the risk of diseases, while the Hong Kong Medical Association reminded people to maintain air circulation by keeping windows open to ensure indoor air quality.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority said on Monday morning there could be disruptions to flights in and out of Hong Kong for a few hours due to the closure of the north runway.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The closure followed an emergency landing by a cargo plane at around 7:30am, during which the jet experienced a flat tyre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said only one runway remained in operation for the time being, and flights schedules may be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It called on passengers to watch out for the latest flight information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of erectile dysfunction pills, anti-depressants and other psychotropic drugs have been seized in Hong Kong this month with four people arrested on suspicion of running a medication mail service without a permit, customs officers said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 1.4 million pills, found in a remote village house in Mui Wo and at a subdivided factory unit in San Po Kong, are believed to be worth around HK$80 million in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the hauls mostly comprised of generic drugs from India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's believed the pills were being posted to dozens of places around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior customs investigator, Hong Yan, said they were looking into whether the two cases are linked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We found that the two syndicates operate in a very similar fashion. They both rented a unit as a centre for packaging and storing the medicines," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They also hired foreigners to package and post the medicines overseas. Furthermore, inside the units, the ways the drugs were categorised and stored were very similar."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said two women arrested in Mui Wo at the start of the month had since been released on bail, while two women arrested in San Po Kong were still in detention.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifteen men and five women have been arrested on suspicion of loan sharking and illegal debt collection, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said that during an operation, officers seized HK$300,000 in cash, bank cards, phones, computers and debt collection notes, as well as cars and watches suspected to be the proceeds of crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said more than a million dollars was loaned to nine people in Sau Mau Ping in recent months, and a group threatened and harassed those who failed to repay the money on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our intelligence indicated that the syndicate used various illegal debt collecting methods, including splashing red paint to debtors’ flats, damaging the door locks and criminal intimidation to force the debtors to repay their loans,” said Inspector Leung Ho-ching.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police added that they have identified a bank account linked to the case that was allegedly used to launder at least HK$5.8 million.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757666_1_20240616155357.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said a survey it has carried out suggests the majority of people living in poor housing support the government's goal of ridding the city of low-quality subdivided units, but they're also concerned about where they would move to if it happens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Caritas Community Development Service said it spoke to 231 tenants of subdivided flats and cubic apartments from December to April, and found that 70 percent think the government should regulate low-quality subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 60 percent said they worry they wouldn't be able to find an affordable home if such a move was taken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They think that if the government takes the action to regulate subdivided housing, it means that there would be fewer subdivided flats in the urban areas. So they may need to afford a higher rent, and they may not find suitable units," said Kelvin Lee, a social worker with the NGO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government's Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units has been asked to come up with proposals on minimum living standards for such homes, as well as how those that are substandard can be eradicated altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, officials announced that applications for Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing will open from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee said single non-elderly people are less likely to secure a place under a points system that prioritises families living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The social worker added that building more public housing is the long-term solution to the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to consider using the vacant land reserve to build more public housing, especially in the urban areas, since most of the low-income talents are living in those urban areas, which is near their jobs and schools for the children," Lee said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) on Sunday said more than half of shop operators it spoke to in Kowloon City want to move back to the neighbourhood after a makeover designed to beautify the area and preserve its culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing project, covering three sections of Carpenter Road and Nga Tsin Wai Road, will see the Kowloon City wet market relocated and some of its surrounding areas demolished to make way for more than 4,000 new flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, wrote on his blog that the URA held 15 meetings with wet market food vendors and Thai restaurant operators to brief them on relocation and transitional arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They shared with the team that they have been doing business in the 'Dragon City' district for many years and are attached to the district, hoping to pass on the friendship," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some operators also hope to pass on the regional characteristics to the next generation through the relocation arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said the authority will reserve some shops for these vendors after the area is rebuilt and offer concessionary rent for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA earlier said it hopes the new Kowloon City Market can be completed by 2030 while most of the other proposed facilities can be ready by 2037.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The first overnight high-speed trains from Beijing and Shanghai to Hong Kong arrived on Sunday morning, with tourism minister Kevin Yeung saying passengers were generally positive about the “sleep and arrive” arrangement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yeung and MTR CEO Jacob Kam welcomed passengers at Hong Kong West Kowloon Station and handed out souvenirs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tourism chief said passengers told him they thought it was good to be able to sleep on the train and arrive refreshed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe it provides an extra option. In the past, most travellers from Shanghai and Beijing would choose to take a plane. Even if they took high-speed trains, that would be during daytime,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now that the option of taking an overnight train is available, passengers can make better use of their time. They can sleep on the train and when they arrive in Hong Kong in the morning they can do the things they want. They have a whole day to travel.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger from Shanghai, who brought his son along to experience a sleeper train for the first time, said he was satisfied with the facilities, but his son had trouble sleeping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The noise level is a bit high. Otherwise it's quite good. There's no problem for an individual to fall asleep. During the trip the train passed through some tunnels that generated a big noise," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kam said while demand for the first few trains was really positive, it is still too early to discuss the possibility of increasing the frequency of services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to consider the passenger needs and the needs for various destinations. Also we need to consider that the sleeper trains pass through various railway tracks and they require maintenance. We need to strive a balance between maintenance work and the passenger need,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the first Beijing-bound sleeper train from Hong Kong arrived in the capital on Sunday morning. Secretary for Transport Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, said he really enjoyed his meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I had grilled beef with king trumpet mushroom rice. The portion of the beef is quite large and there are many varieties of the side dishes. There are vegetables, meat and sauce, and the rice is also warm. Therefore I highly recommend it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he was not worried that the new services will encourage more tourists not to stay in a hotel when they visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four sleeper trains run every Friday to Monday night, with two travelling from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Beijing and two going in the opposite direction.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong officials on Sunday celebrated Father's Day by sharing stories about them and their children, as they wished all dads a good day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee posted a photo online of a card his son made him decades ago when he nominated him for a "top ten modern day father" award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he felt warm and proud to see it again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's wife had written a message on the card saying "although he is very busy with work, he spends time every week chit-chatting with me. He also encouraged me to take part in more community work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said it was unfortunate he couldn't attend the fathers' award ceremony at the time because of work, and nowadays he also loses time with his family because he is busy in the office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Lee thanked his family for supporting him so he can focus on work and make good policies for the people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he spent the weekend playing football with several fathers and their sons, saying many fathers are often too busy to play with their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan wrote on his weekly blog that the government has been putting a lot of resources into sports facilities in recent years, from five-a-side football pitches to the Kai Tak Sports Park, which will be the biggest ever sports infrastructure project in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the park is due to open in the middle of next year and said it should hopefully bring business opportunities as well as spectacular sport and other performances for locals and tourists alike.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is investigating a case of suspected mad honey poisoning, after a 35-year-old man became dizzy and started vomiting about half an hour after eating the honey on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The following day he went to the accident and emergency department at Kwong Wah Hospital and was admitted with low blood pressure and a slow heart rate. He is in stable condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mad honey poisoning is caused by ingestion of honey containing grayanotoxins derived from plants belonging to the Ericaceae family - including rhododendrons, a CHP spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial enquiries show the patient had consumed honey mailed to Hong Kong by a friend from Nepal. Investigations are ongoing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first high-speed sleeper train from Hong Kong to Beijing departed on Saturday evening, with the transport minister calling the new overnight services a "breakthrough".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, also said the administration would look to see whether it was possible to increase the number of sleeper trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now we get four days of sleeper services. But it depends on how it goes. And I would say that if it is welcomed by the general public, we'll push for more," he told reporters prior to departure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The train for Beijing left at 6.24 pm on Saturday, and passengers will arrive at their destination about half a day later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy and excited that I can take the first train to Beijing. I haven't been to Beijing for a long while. I'll be able to see the bustle and the prosperity of our nation's capital," a lady surnamed Chung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This train is really good. It is fast. I only need to sleep one night and then I will arrive when I wake up. It saves a lot of time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China Travel Service was among the travel agencies allotted tickets for the trip. Its managing director, Chen Rui-dong, said all of its 35 tickets were quickly snapped up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following the chief executive's announcement, the tickets were sold out in half a day. We hope that there will be more sleeper train services in future," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another sleeper train bound for Shanghai was set to depart from Hong Kong at 7.49 pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new regular services, which will have trains running between Friday and Monday, trips from Hong Kong's West Kowloon terminus will take about 12.5 hours to get to Beijing, and around 11 hours to Shanghai.

    Heavy rain fails to dampen dragon boat race enthusiasm

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of spectators on Saturday flocked to the Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade to watch the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races in spite of the heavy rain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 competitors, representing over 170 teams from 12 countries or regions, are taking part in the two-day sporting event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Singaporean rower said he was enjoying the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a new experience for us because we don't normally race out in the sea. I think in Singapore, we normally train in the reservoir, so the water is much calmer. I think it's a totally new experience for us," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's very great, very lively. I think we do not have such big international competitions back in Singapore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mainland tourist, Mr Shao, said the showers hadn't dampened the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The weather is cool. It is nice to have the dragon boat races here, whether it be from the spectators' or rowers' point of view. Probably because the race venue is close to the city centre, there are many tourists here. I think everyone can feel that Hong Kong is promoting Chinese traditional culture," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The races were organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong, China Dragon Boat Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fireworks display over Victoria Harbour scheduled for 8 pm was cancelled in light of the three Amber Rainstorm Warning Signals issued by the Observatory on Saturday.

    Singles not ruled out of LPH, says Winnie Ho

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Singles not ruled out of LPH, says Winnie Ho" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757541_1_20240615110312.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing secretary Winnie Ho has played down suggestions that people who are single will be less likely to secure a Light Public Housing unit under a points system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Applications for the first batch of the modular temporary housing flats in Ngau Tau Kok and Yuen Long begin on June 24. Only those who have been on the waiting list for public rental housing for at least three years can apply, and they will remain on the public housing list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the points system, families living in poor conditions, households with infants and the elderly, and people with disabilities would be given extra marks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, the minister said single-person households still have a chance for a light public housing unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entire social structure is centred on the family. Families take care of elderly people and children. They often have greater burdens and face situations which are more complex. So it's designed with families in mind," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Individuals, who are single, can still apply for light public housing because they can still qualify in certain circumstances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the majority of flats designed for one or two people, Ho said the provision of different home sizes was based on an earlier study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two people could already be considered to be a family. There are also households that have a single parent with a child. They are two people and that's a small family," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to results from a study on subdivided flats in 2021, around 70 percent are households with one or two people. Households of three, four or more accounted for 30 percent. So based on this ratio, and because our measure is aimed at taking care of people living in such conditions, the design is based on the actual situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With regard to the recent government clamp down on better-off people taking advantage of public housing, the minister said 14 tenants, who had failed to return a declaration form to authorities, would be told to vacate their units. They were among the first batch of 88,000 public housing tenants required to make declarations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And for a second group of 250,000 tenants told to make declarations, Ho said more than 90 percent had returned their forms, while officials had repossessed around 1,400 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Ho said a task force on subdivided units would submit a report in August after collecting views on the matter. She said some had suggested such flats should be a minimum of seven to 10 square metres in size.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government remains committed to large-scale developments despite challenges brought about by the geopolitical and economic situation, a top adviser for Chief Executive John Lee has said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephen Wong, who heads the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, also said the city's leader hoped the administration would work more closely with the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't underestimate the challenges... but also, on balance, we are very optimistic and we obviously have faith in the future, which is why the government is committed to large-scale developments, for example, in San Tin, a science and tech city, and the Northern Metropolis," Wong told RTHK's Your Home Address programme on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are big developments that are saying that we have faith in our future. We trust that the future will bring further development to Hong Kong. So I think as long as there's a capable government that works closely with society, with the efficient market, then we can bring opportunities to a very special place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Wong was appointed the head of the policy unit, which serves as a think-tank for the Chief Executive in formulating policies by conducting research and gathering opinions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday expressed strong dissatisfaction and rejected criticism from the United States and  other Western countries over Hong Kong's decision to revoke the passports of six people accused of national security crimes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said in a statement that people who threaten national security often flee to other countries and continue to pose a threat to national security in various ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People who endanger national security often abscond overseas to avoid criminal liability and continue to endanger national security through various means, such as colluding with forces outside Hong Kong to put pressure on the central government and the Hong Kong government, or setting up organisations to endanger national security outside Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The measures taken against the fugitives are aimed at combating, deterring and preventing such conduct and facilitating their return to Hong Kong to face law enforcement and judicial proceedings."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said that the United States and other Western countries have made false and irresponsible statements to confuse the public.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday said a woman is in critical condition in intensive care with botulism after receiving botox injections at a beauty clinic in Zhuhai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre said the 57-year-old woman, who was in good health, received the jabs between April 27 and May 15. About three days after the final shot, her speech became slurred and she had difficulty swallowing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CHP said she was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on May 22 but was discharged, against medical advice, the same day. The following day she was admitted again to Queen Mary after her symptoms worsened and then discharged two days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On June 2, she was admitted to intensive care at Tseung Kwan O Hospital due to a shortage of breath, choking, and limb weakness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre says Botox, or botulinum toxin, injections should only be prescribed and performed by registered doctors. It said the case had been reported to mainland authorities.

    Govt confident in Kai Tak park transport facilities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Friday said he's confident transport facilities would be able to cope with crowds heading to and from the Kai Tak Sports Park, as there will be various modes of transport to the venue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An inter-departmental working group held its first meeting on Friday, and Chan said the main facilities of the park would be completed by the end of this year, and would open to the public in the first half of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main stadium of the park can accommodate up to 50,000 spectators, and Chan said transport facilities, including the nearby Sung Wong Toi and Kai Tak MTR stations, would be able to cater all of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there are large-scale events, we will increase the frequency of MTR trains to boost passenger capacity. We will also arrange taxis and buses. People can also walk further to other stations, like Choi Hung MTR Station. We are confident that order will be maintained," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that authorities were planning test runs ahead of the park's opening, and they would simulate a crowd of people leaving the park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about noise complaints after a recent music festival, Chan said the main stadium of the sports park has a retractable roof, and authorities would conduct noise assessments to ensure it meets proper standards.

    Time for Hong Kong to diversify portfolio: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong must not put all its eggs in one basket and should step up efforts to explore new market opportunities, according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister acknowledged that despite high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, the SAR's economy was on target to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent for the full year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau felt there was a need for businesses to diversify their investment portfolio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are seeing many opportunities around, especially in new economies in central Asia, central Europe, eastern Europe," he told reporters at a press event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed he was planning an upcoming duty visit to Peru in November, while there are plans to set up government outposts in Egypt and Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will be helping the motherland for inviting investment from all those new economies using Hong Kong as a gateway into the mainland," Yau added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event to promote Hong Kong's industries, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said a sprawling technology park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop is going ahead full steam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed that the first three buildings within the park would be completed later this year, and authorities were still deciding how to carve out 87 hectares of space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The park will be developed in two phases - the western side will provide around one million square metres of office space for different sectors such as artificial intelligence," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will also be accommodation and ancillary facilities for professionals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The I&T minister had previously said that dozens of tech enterprises had expanded their businesses in the territory, with many of them in the life and health, new energy and microelectronics sectors.

    GBA has edge over San Francisco in finance: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub has provided a "competitive advantage" to the Greater Bay Area in financial services over its counterpart in San Francisco, according to the financial chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One distinctive feature of the SAR, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a media interview, was the opportunity for companies to list on the city's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have Hong Kong, in the Greater Bay Area, being an international financial centre. We can marry both technological innovation and financial services to prosper. And this is the distinction between Hong Kong and San Francisco," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you want to develop and grow the innovation and technology sector, you need a lot of capital... But also you need to have an [international financial centre], a listing platform."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite that, Chan said there were similarities between the two bay areas in southern China and California, with the two being "economic powerhouses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On foreign investment to the Greater Bay Area, the financial chief said the SAR remained attractive and competitive amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given this geopolitical tension, the capital market would be more volatile. Certain funding, say for example, funding from the US, may reduce their allocation to this part of the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in our engagement with the investing sector in the US, they are still very keen in the Greater Bay Area and the development of China, because they believe this is the growing future. And using the Greater Bay Area is not just for the Chinese market, but also for the Asia market as a whole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said local authorities were working hard to reach out to the international community and host mega events to clear up misunderstandings about the city, while also bringing about more than HK$10 billion into the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief also said the number of arrivals this year had risen thanks to the expansion of the solo travel scheme, allowing mainland residents to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis instead of in tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combined with a rise in consumption, hopes of lower interest rates in the near future, and the resumption of international flights, Hong Kong's economy is estimated to grow between 2.5 and 3.5 percent, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's property prices, which plunged by almost a quarter from its historic high in September 2021 to February this year, Chan said it's normal for housing costs to adjust amid high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed out that both home prices and the number of transactions had risen after the government scrapped all property-cooling measures in February.

    CE confident in GBA opportunities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he believed there were many opportunities to explore in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Hong Kong could contribute with its unique strengths as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking with the media on the issue, Lee said Hong Kong would achieve greater benefits through cooperation with mainland counterparts in terms of technology and talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology integration is important. We contribute what we have been good at, such as research, such as high quality education, and then we combine that with the high quality research and talent in the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a strength of attracting both international talent, as well as mainland talent, and Hong Kong has been nurturing local talent. So Hong Kong has again the advantage of having the beauty of three areas, local, mainland and international. And that I think is a unique strength of Hong Kong in developing talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the city's future role as a financial hub amid growing concerns about geopolitical tensions between East and West, Lee expressed confidence in the investment and market sentiment despite the uncertainty and added risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wise investors look at markets in the long term. They know at the end, the market is always right. Politics doesn't affect the market in the long term. It will have an effect, but smart investors will find a way to absorb that political consideration and make very wise decisions based on economic development and economic opportunities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added he accomplished two important tasks in the two years since he took office, including enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law and completing the District Council elections.

    Cigarettes ban won't affect tourism: Lo Chung-mau

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Friday brushed aside lawmakers' concerns that banning vaping and flavoured cigarettes would make Hong Kong a less attractive destination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government last week put forward 10 measures to cut the number of smokers in the city, including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Starry Lee said Hong Kong would be less competitive when compared with other international financial centres which allow smoking, such as London, while retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said the ban would discourage travellers from visiting Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lo said people did not come to Hong Kong just to smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most tourists who come to Hong Kong are non-smokers. Non-smokers always outnumber smokers. When they come to Hong Kong, they don't come to Hong Kong just to smoke. They come to Hong Kong to identify business opportunities. They want to experience our culinary experiences, tourism experiences, and so on,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So when we have a tobacco-free, vibrant, and healthy Hong Kong, it’s always better to have a city that is [free] of smoke.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers also raised concerns about the limitations in enforcement, with election committee sector lawmaker Chan Pui-leung saying there were staff shortages at the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office, and the definition of a queue was ambiguous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, catering sector lawmaker Tommy Cheung said the government should allocate more resources to educate the youth about the dangers of smoking, rather than solely focusing on banning cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister explained that creating a tobacco-free Hong Kong would require more than just enforcement efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In fact, it's not just about relying on law enforcement, but also about using certain enforcement measures to establish a culture, a norm, so that everyone will know in which areas smoking is prohibited. It can also be said that everyone is a smoking control ambassador.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.

    ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757423_1_20240614141154.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC has arrested 20 people in connection with an alleged vehicle-testing scam.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body accused staff of a designated private testing centre of accepting advantages from garage proprietors or middlemen, and helping private cars that did not meet the required standards to pass the exhaust emission test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those arrested were staff of a designated testing centre, owners of three garages in the New Territories, middlemen as well as contract workers of the Transport Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten private cars were also seized in the operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the Transport Department’s requirements, all private cars manufactured for over six years must undergo an annual examination at designated test centres in order to renew their vehicle licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The genuine fee for the examination is HK$585. What was happening was that the owners were paying a one-stop shop price for all the service. That was between HK$2,000 and HK$3,000,” said ICAC principal investigator David Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the difference between those two prices is the benefits that were made for both parties in either the garage owner would get business from the customers or the testing centre staff would be receiving some of that in bribery money.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams said staff at the testing centre substituted the results of cars that they knew would fail with those that had already passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said about 20 cars were referred by the garages to pass the examination fraudulently every month, and it's still trying to find out how long the syndicate has been in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Transport Department said it was very concerned about the incident and would cooperate with the ICAC in the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said vehicle testing at the centre has been suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would strengthen the management and supervision of vehicle testing centres as advised by the ICAC.

    On World Blood Donor Day, fresh appeal for donations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Red Cross on Friday held a blood donation drive to mark World Blood Donor Day, with transfusion centres set up around town.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chief executive and medical director of the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Dr Lee Cheuk-kwong, called on the public to donate blood with inventory being low in the past few weeks due to weather, adding that blood has a limited shelf life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whenever there is rain, particularly heavy rain, people may just stay at home or go to shopping malls instead of going out to donations, so this is one of the limiting factors. Also, in rainy days, some companies may not be able to work with us in arranging the blood donation drive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Blood donations are still needed for many types of medical treatment and at the moment there's no replacement, so we need people to come out for donations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He especially called on people with blood types O and A to come forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the service has been targeting young people, especially university students.

  <br/>
  "Over the past few years after the pandemic, we have resumed some programmes in the young donors recruitment, in particular in the university," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Visiting schools remains one of our main objectives in our current recruitment strategies. Only the problem for us is fewer classes and students in the secondary schools, with those eligible mostly in form four, five and six."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The service collected a total of 210,103 units of blood in 2023, with just over 124,000 donors. Both figures were up from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the donation process is straightforward and rewarding, adding that each donation saves three lives.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government has rejected an annual report on the SAR by the European Commission, saying it had "unfounded and biased content" on issues such as safeguarding national security and human rights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late on Thursday, the administration also urged the European Union (EU) to stop interfering in the territory's affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability by slandering the city's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by the commission outlined the political and economic developments in the SAR in 2023, pointing to the city's national security law and relevant court trials, as well as district council elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These developments undermine trust in the rule of law in Hong Kong and affect Hong Kong’s standing as an international business hub," said commission vice-president Josep Borrell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the report also noted "hopeful signs of progress on the rights of LGBTI+ people in Hong Kong, mainly carried forward by the judiciary", as well as substantial commercial links between the SAR and the EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration stressed that the city's national security laws were "precisely for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also better safeguards the fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents of the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and other people, including those doing business, in the city," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU must immediately act reasonably and sensibly, and stop smearing the laws safeguarding national security in the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavy rain of up to 100 millimetres an hour was recorded in parts of Tsuen Wan and Yuen Long as bad weather hit the city on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 50 millimetres of rain was recorded in other parts of the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The red rainstorm warning was in effect from 10am to 11.30am, before it was downgraded to the amber rainstorm warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said serious road flooding and traffic congestion could disrupt normal school hours and people should carefully consider the conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said all afternoon schools have been suspended. It also said morning and whole-day schools that were in session should continue until the end of school hours, and ensure that conditions are safe before allowing students to return home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Classes of evening schools are expected to proceed as usual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department is calling on members of the public to report any flooding, while the Labour Department said employers should ensure the safety of workers.

    LPH quality same as public housing, says NGO

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy director of NGO Society for Community Organization says the quality of the first batch of light public housing matches that of standard public housing, while the rental levels are much cheaper than subdivided flats and 90 percent of standard public housing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Actually, they're quite similar to public housing... only the kitchen is open," said Sze Lai-shan while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze also said the facilities were similar to transitional social housing, which is provided by government-supported NGOs. She said in some cases it was even better as the units were new and there were electrical appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday the government said applications would open later this month for 4,400 of the temporary units in Ngau Tau Kok and Yuen Long. The temporary modular units are intended for people in the queue for public housing, and those who take up the offer of light public housing will remain on the public housing list. Priority will be given to those with urgent needs, such as those living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze said some potential tenants were concerned about how many buses they would need to take, as the new units weren't linked to the MTR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive, John Lee, first introduced the idea of light public housing in his policy address two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the new units will range from HK$740 to HK$2,650.

 The Chinese University's School of Continuing and Professional Studies on Thursday said the personal information of more than 20,000 students, staff, faculty and visitors has been hacked.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school said it found out last week that its online learning platform had been breached, compromising data such as names, emails as well as student numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was contacting those affected and that their personal details were not appearing on the dark web.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has been notified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school added that it is improving cybersecurity to try to prevent a repeat of the incident.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice said on Thursday that it has filed an appeal against the acquittal of one of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were cleared of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law last month, with three High Court judges saying in their verdict that they were not sure if the pair had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice said it has filed an appeal against Lau's acquittal, but that it won't challenge the judgement regarding Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen others were found guilty of the subversion offence and 31 pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mitigation hearings for those convicted will begin later this month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said there are no plans to keep a makeshift hospital in Lok Ma Chau open longer than originally planned, despite its high usage and positive responses from patients.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Central Government-Aided Emergency Hospital in the Lok Ma Chau Loop area was originally designed to treat Covid-19 patients. It was later turned into a temporary hospital as part of a trial to improve public healthcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The temporary facility began operation in April 2023 and is scheduled to run until 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Sin Ngai-chuen, clinical stream coordinator of the New Territories East Cluster, said the plan is to operate “as long as we can” and follow the directions of the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Central Government-Aided Emergency Hospital, by default, is a temporary building in nature. Of course, it can last for a bit longer in terms of years, but it's not going to be long-lasting because this infrastructure and all the basic facilities are going to be just temporary,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But certainly the result we have obtained here is very encouraging in terms of a pilot scheme. So we will wrap up the findings and experience and we'll try and come up with a possible future development plan.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital offers a variety of medical services, including diagnostic radiology, endoscopy, drug-resistant organism screening and sleep studies, and is now extending services to include vitamin D pathology tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HA said as of the end of May, the hospital had conducted more than 18,000 tests with its medical-imaging services, about 4,000 more than originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median waiting times for patients to get a CT scan, MRI scan and ultrasound scan have all been reduced, from up to 140 weeks to as short as 25 weeks, it noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And about 690 patients have taken part in the sleep studies at the hospital, with the waiting times up to three years shorter than at a general public hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sin said the HA will learn from its experience with the makeshift hospital and study the possibility of diverting more patient care to outpatient facilities, to help reduce the pressure on hospitals.

    Govt to hire consultant to probe CLP power outages

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Thursday said the government will ask an independent consultant to investigate CLP power outages over the past three years, and the electricity company will have to pay for the cost of the probe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tse met the managing director of CLP, Joseph Law, after more than 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the frequency of glitches has led to concerns that the service quality of CLP has declined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) will hire an independent consultant to investigate voltage dips and power interruptions in the past three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultant will examine aspects such as safety designs, the power supply system's ability to resist external factors, repair work and preventative maintenance measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultant will recommend improvement measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EMSD has ordered the company to hand in a detailed report on the Wong Tai Sin outage within a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP, for its part, apologised again for the inconvenience caused by the power outage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it will set up a special working group with the EMSD to review how it manages the power system, and a report will be submitted to the government within one year.

    Six in 10 happy with their family life: survey

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Researchers say socio-demographic factors play a key role in deciding the perceived family happiness in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757289_1_20240613163201.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly six in 10 people have given positive feedback in a survey of family happiness conducted by Hong Kong University.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The research team, which also includes academics from the department of social work at Baptist University, invited around 4,500 adults to answer an online questionnaire between July and August 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Respondents were asked to rate, on a scale of one to 10, a series of indices, including family "xingfu", a broad Chinese term for happiness and contentment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 58 percent of participants gave a score of seven or higher, compared to a mean of 6.53, the results varied according to their socio-demographic characteristics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher-income individuals and homeowners tended to be more content with their lives, as well as those who were 55 or older.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Kelvin Wang, who led the study, said the findings differed from similar polls such as the World Happiness Report jointly commissioned by the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think (the World Happiness Report) is not able to 100 percent capture the xingfu ... in Chinese groups," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the West, we all know that many things which [people] do are to pursue happiness on an individual level. But for China ... the traditional wisdom is that family is almost in a higher position than individual well-being."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers also compared the results with a separate survey measuring the so-called 3Hs in family life - health, harmony and happiness. They noted a "moderate to high" correlation between the two sets of attributes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang suggested that people make an effort to communicate with their family members and be generous in offering praise, either face-to-face or through instant messaging apps.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing (LPH) will open for applications from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of modular units for people waiting for public housing was introduced during Chief Executive John Lee's policy address in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters following a media visit to the flats, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said it showed the government's determination in addressing the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is only the first batch. Our target is to provide 30,000 light public housing units by the years 2026 and 2027. All the projects are in full speed. All the projects are being pushed forward on the site," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the flats range from HK$740 to HK$2,650, and tenants were expected to move in as early as the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said priority would be given to families living in poor conditions, based on a points system, adding that people in urgent need were encouraged to submit their applications before July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example families with young children... Many organisations tell us that the changes that can bring to these families are really remarkable and very obvious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because children when they grow up, like from four years old to 10 years old, this is a very critical period...if you leave them in sub-divided units in such a poor condition, it really affects their learning, their growing up and their social abilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister added that people with disabilities, families with infants and the elderly, and those who choose remote LPH sites, would also be given extra marks under the points system.

    CLP urged to explain recent power outages

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have called on CLP to give the public an explanation regarding recent power outages in the city, after over 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company says the latest blackout was caused by a faulty cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman who lives in Lung Kwong House said she struggled with the heat when her air conditioning went off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to turn on two portable fans. It lasted for four hours. I was feeling so hot. I haven't experienced such a situation since I lived here," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another resident said he couldn't understand why the power company did not activate a backup system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to walk all the way up to my flat. There was no electricity, no air conditioning, and the food inside my refrigerator turned bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said there have been multiple power outages in the city in recent months and this is unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expect the government to try to intervene in the situation and ask the company [CLP] to give us the full report on how to, in the long term, make the power supply become more stable," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not looking into an individual incident. We are looking at a full picture, whether they need some fundamental changes or essential improvements, so that we can guarantee the power supply is stable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs, said the threshold in the current penalty system for power companies is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said CLP would face a penalty of HK$20 million if it recorded 15 million minutes of power disruption to its customers in a year. Wednesday night's outage would have caused around one million minutes of disruption, he added.

    Lawmakers welcome East Kowloon transit system plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The smart and green mass transit system will have eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East. Photo courtesy of the Transport and Logistics Bureau" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757264_1_20240613134659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday welcomed a proposal for an elevated mass transit system in East Kowloon, with the project expected to be completed in 2033.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport and Logistics Bureau submitted a proposal to the Legislative Council on Wednesday to build a seven-kilometre-long system in the area, which would include six kilometres of viaducts and one kilometre of tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The smart and green mass transit system would mainly operate on an elevated corridor, and there would be eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Bill Tang, who represents the Kowloon East Constituency, said the elevated mass transit system could solve traffic congestion in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a very, very significant step that the government has already made a decision to satisfy our Kowloon East residents' long-term request to improve our traffic needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan said the network needed to be fully integrated into the areas it served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government must ensure that each station is well connected with the residents, including setting up multiple different entries and also the interconnection system with the related housing estates," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said pedestrian facilities would be built to link the existing Choi Hung MTR Station with the proposed Choi Hung East Station, and Yau Tong MTR Station with the proposed Yau Tong East Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project is expected to be completed in 2033, but Ngan hopes the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government should also look into possibilities of linking the system up with the Kai Tak area, such as Tsz Wan Shan and Diamond Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities would seek about HK$262.5 million of funding approval from Legco’s public works subcommittee next Wednesday.

    Hydrogen development plan to be unveiled next week: CE

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee told lawmakers that the government's hydrogen development strategy will be unveiled next week." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757256_1_20240613130238.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that officials will role out a development strategy on hydrogen next week, involving the development of hydrogen energy and vehicles powered by the gas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a question and answer session in Legco on the country's initiatives to develop new quality productive forces, Lee said the Environment and Ecology Bureau will announce its hydrogen plan on June 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said some laws may have to be changed to allow the safe storage and maintenance of the gas, which is easily combustible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government will look into new facilities such as hydrogen gas stations, and officials have already approved several pilot schemes involving hydrogen-powered vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We already have [hydrogen fuel cell, HFC] buses on trial now running on the streets, and you will also be seeing the launch of several other projects," the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we have plans to launch a trial project on HFC street washing vehicles, refuse collection vehicles and trams and so on. There will be trial projects too using hydrogen energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive also said the government is facing problems developing a "low-altitude economy", which is currently popular on the mainland, noting that the SAR is filled with high-rise buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB's Elizabeth Quat said there are several things Hong Kong can look into, such as helicopter transit services from the airport directly to business buildings in the Greater Bay Area, local food delivery with drones, and low-flying air tours for travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the legislature also discussed the development of cultural tourism in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Councillor Kenneth Lau, who heads the Heung Yee Kuk, proposed that the government give more funding to rural committees to promote rural cultural activities to tourists, as in-depth cultural tours are becoming more popular.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee agreed that rural representatives know how to design travel itineraries, and government sponsorship would depend on particular projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, lawmaker Gary Zhang, who used to work at the MTR Corporation, said there are many transport enthusiasts in the Greater Bay Area interested in the local transport culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on the authorities to build an extra rail line connecting the planned Hung Shui Kiu Station with Sunny Bay and the Airport Express, so that travellers can get to Lantau and the airport easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he agreed with connecting the Airport Express to more lines, saying officials will seriously look into whether this would be feasible.

    The Green Earth calls for more composting capacity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Founder Edwin Lau quoted current daily composting capacity at being about a fifth of what was required. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757223_1_20240613111509.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of environmental group The Green Earth, Edwin Lau, has welcomed the government's plan to have a food waste recycling bin for each and every public housing block within two years but he says there is still room to expand the composting of waste once it is collected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Lau said government data from 2022 pointed to Hong Kong's daily food waste disposal at being over 3,300 metric tonnes but that current composting capacity was less than 20 percent of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to match both the total amount of food waste collected from the housing estates and also, at the back end, all the facilities or the food waste composting system," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said the Organic Resources Recovery Centre at Siu Ho Wan in North Lantau, known as O-Park 1, was currently up and running and that O-Park 2 at Sha Ling in North District was undergoing trial runs before being operational later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These two added together will be 500 tonnes of food waste capacity per day. And, besides these two, there are two sewage co-digestion plants operating, that all together total 100 tonnes per day capacity. So you add up all these four facilities and there is a maximum of 600 tonnes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said he thought the government had most likely done the calculation to match the front-end and the back-end to prevent any kind of bottle-neck from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, around 90 percent of public estates share some 700 smart recycling bins, and every estate will have at least one bin by next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment minister Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers on Wednesday that the plan was to match the number of blocks with the same amount of bins within two years. Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year and that more bins would be added to estates where there was strong demand.

Photo:" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757214_1_20240613095143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Engineering professor and lawmaker William Wong says one of the reasons The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) chose start-up "SmartMore" for its inaugural investment was its plan to base future research in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the financial return, part of it is the promise to create more positions for researchers. The Smart-More company promised to actually establish an research centre, an AI research centre, in Hong Kong and all these things are actually favourable to Hong Kong developing into an international information technology hub," Wong said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government investment vehicle and SmartMore signed a cooperation deal on Wednesday. The company is involved in artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC's CEO Clara Chan has said there will be different investment themes with AI in June, life sciences in July, and new energy technology in August. Professor Wong, who is the associate dean of the Faculty of Engineering at the Chinese University, was also asked for his views on these investment themes and whether they would suit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From this particular case, you can see the government is working very hard step by step... to satisfy the KPIs," he said referring to the investment term 'Key Performance Indicator'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Financial Secretary Paul Chan hailed the partnership between the government-owned investment vehicle and the local tech unicorn, saying it would help boost Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Parts of Wong Tai Sin plunged into darkness for four hours on Wednesday evening, with CLP saying a faulty cable was to blame for cutting off power to more than 2,200 customers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos on social media showed a number of residential buildings and shopping malls were affected by the blackout at around 8pm. Power was eventually restored shortly after midnight. Temple Mall North, Lower Wong Tai Sin Estate and Mei Tung Estate were among the areas affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said it was very concerned about the outage. "Residents were trapped in lifts and might have an uncomfortable night under this hot weather," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency shelters were set up at Tung Tau Community Centre and Wong Tai Sin Community Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Fire Services Department, there were at least four reports of people trapped in lifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power outage was caused by a malfunction in an 11,000-volt cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm apologised to those affected, adding that urgent repair work was being carried out, with emergency generators taken to the site.

    Show of force necessary for absconders: Regina Ip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Regina Ip backed the government's move to impose sanctions against six individuals wanted for alleged national security offences, saying it was necessary to demonstrate to the public that there are consequences for breaking the law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I doubt very much whether these absconders will actually come back to Hong Kong to face the law," the former security minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it will demonstrate to any potential absconders that the government takes absconding highly seriously, and there are punitive measures directed against them if they do run away from the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another former security chief-turned-lawmaker, Lai Tung-kwok, said the purpose of revoking the fugitives' passports was to limit their mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he admitted they could still visit countries using other travel documents, such as a British National (Overseas) passport which is not recognised in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong warned that anyone who joins paid subscriptions of websites or channels run by the six persons may be seen as providing financial aid to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong said people may still fall foul of the law by simply "following" such pages, as this may indirectly help the wanted persons generate revenue through advertisements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Wednesday said a government taskforce set up to look into a  public spat involving top management at the University of Hong Kong will help with internal communication, rather than investigating specific incidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang and the head of the university's governing council, Priscilla Wong, have been in conflict over senior appointments and management issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday announced the formation of the taskforce, comprising of Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li and head of the University Grants Council Tim Lui. It said their role will include coordinating cooperation and communication within HKU.

  <br/>
  Choi said the pair will contact or meet people involved in the matter, to find out more about the issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group doesn't have a timetable...we hope to gradually show results to the public in the process," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The aim is not just to come up with a written report on the matter, we want to play an actual role."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he expects each public housing block to have a food waste recycling bin within two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to lawmakers at a Legco meeting, he said about 700 smart recycling bins for food waste were installed at about 90 percent of public estates across the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects the smart recycling bins would be installed at all public estates in Hong Kong by next month, which was a month ahead of the original schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added more bins would be installed at public estates, with the goal of installing a bin at each public housing block within two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmakers questioned if the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some old residents told me that there are 11 blocks in their estate, with 380 units, but there are only three food waste smart recycling bins in the whole estate... Can we expedite the process and have one bin in each block within one year?" lawmaker Kitson Yang asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said discussions would be made with the Housing Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see which residential buildings have higher usage of food waste smart recycling bins, and we will install more bins at those estates with higher usage. We will also replace the inner bins of the recycling bins more often to enhance its capacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An insider trading case against Asian hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its British founder Simon Sadler and a former trader has been moved to the District Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Eastern Magistrates' Court approved the prosecution’s request to transfer the case to a higher court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next hearing is scheduled to take place at the District Court on July 2, the court ruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum prison term a district court judge can impose is seven years, versus two to three years for the magistrate's court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case marks a turning point for one of Asia's biggest and oldest hedge funds as well as a step toward heightened scrutiny of trading activities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said last month it had started criminal proceedings against Segantii, its founder and chief investment officer Sadler and former trader Daniel La Rocca on suspicion of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company before a block trade in June 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accusation relates to insider information about Hong Kong-listed fashion chain Esprit Holdings, the court readout revealed, adding Segantii received the information from Tony Psarianos, a person connected to Esprit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psarianos was an investment banker at Merrill Lynch from 2007 to 2021, according to SFC licence records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, dubbed Asia's "block trade king", is also the owner of his home-town soccer team, Blackpool Football Club. (Reuters)

    Woman loses final appeal over Quarry Bay shootings

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's top court has dismissed an appeal by a woman who was jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle and wounding two other relatives. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757064_1_20240612115331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle lost her final appeal against her convictions for murder on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former bodyguard Tsim Sum-kit also shot and wounded two other relatives in the attack in Quarry Bay Park in 2018, following a family lunch to discuss dividing up the estate of her late grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a High Court trial in 2021, the defence failed to the convince the jury that Tsim had suffered from an abnormality of the mind which resulted in an impairment of mental responsibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her latest appeal, Tsim argued that the legal requirement for a defendant to prove they suffer from diminished responsibility – if this is to be used as a partial defence to murder – infringes upon the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a written judgement, a panel of five Court of Final Appeal judges said the question of diminished responsibility does not affect the presumption of innocence as it is not an ingredient of the offence a defendant is charged with, but an extenuating mitigating circumstance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said diminished responsibility is a factor that only comes into play if and when prosecutors have proven a defendant's guilt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The partial defence of diminished responsibility does not in any way reduce the burden on the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence of murder," the judges said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is only when a defendant is prima facie guilty of murder that the plea of diminished responsibility becomes relevant. If the prosecution has not already discharged the onus of proving the actus reus and mens rea of murder, the defendant will be entitled to an outright acquittal on the charge of murder and the plea of diminished responsibility will have no further relevance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsim had also asked the court to consider whether the requirement under the Homicide Ordinance for the defence to prove diminished responsibility is proportionate and justified, or whether offering some evidence to support the claim ought to be enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this point, the judges said the ordinance has "the legitimate aim of alleviating the prosecution from an unworkable burden arising from the practical difficulties of proving a matter so personal to the accused".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that a number of factors support this conclusion, including "the fact mental disorders and their effects are not part of ordinary life experience of a jury [and] the fact an accused cannot be compelled to be subject to medical examination by the prosecution."

    CUHK unveils novel bladder cancer surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dr Jeremy Teoh (seated) says the new surgery technique can remove the whole tumour in one piece rather than fragmenting it, reducing the chance of the cancer returning. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757084_1_20240612145650.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese University’s Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it had identified a new surgery technique that was better at preventing bladder cancer from recurring in patients compared with traditional procedures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three hundred and fifty bladder cancer patients participated in the clinical trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half of them underwent a new surgery technique called en bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT) and the other half underwent traditional procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Jeremy Teoh, who led the research, noted that the one-year cancer recurrence rate for patients who had received traditional surgery was between 30 and 40 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, Teoh said the recurrence rate in those who had received ERBT dropped to about 28 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Essentially during the [new] surgery, we try to preserve the whole tumour, try not to touch it, avoid fragmentation of the tumour, and also the whole specimen can be retrieved in one piece to ensure a complete resection by histology,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technique is currently available at 13 hospitals in Hong Kong, including Prince of Wales Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teoh said all bladder cancer patients with a tumour size of less than three centimetres could consult with their doctors about having the new surgery.

    'Retailers must maintain their competitiveness'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, on Wednesday urged the retail sector to enhance its efforts in maintaining its competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at the Hong Kong Retail Summit, organised by the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Yau said economic activity in the city had returned to normal and tourist numbers were growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau said the retail sector still faced various challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must also confront the various new challenges facing the retail industry, as the preferences and behaviour patterns of tourists - and Hongkongers - are changing," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Retailers must keep pace with these changes, continuously innovate, and adjust their operational strategies in order to maintain their competitiveness and advantage in an ever-changing market environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the summit, the chairwoman of the city’s retail management association, Annie Yau-Tse, said the retail performance in both the tourist and local markets had been disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We [have been seeing] the trend of [budget travel] since last year. That's why we see that the tourists are actually focusing on enjoying their time in Hong Kong, like taking photos, but not really buying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This trend is actually really affecting our industry, because in the past we have been making a lot of business out of the tourists who are actually coming for shopping. But nowadays, you don't really see too many people carrying their suitcases for shopping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau-Tse said retailers in Hong Kong should leverage technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to understand consumer patterns better and create tailored promotion plans to adapt to the changing market dynamics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker and lawyer Holden Chow has accused Lord Jonathan Sumption of "political advocacy" over his comments in an opinion piece earlier this week that commented on Hong Kong's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lord Sumption, who recently resigned as a judge on the Court of Final Appeal, wrote an article in the Financial Times newspaper entitled "The rule of law in Hong Kong is in grave danger".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=957633&livetime=20240612000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  programme, Chow said the judge's comments were "grossly inappropriate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow said they would put pressure on the courts when they heard cases, and contrasted Sumption's words with the comments from two other departing justices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Chief Executive John Lee also spoke out over the comments, saying a judge's professional duty is to interpret and apply the law, and that his or her expertise is not on politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the judge had expressed different views a few years ago.

    Six national security fugitives stripped of passports

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A government spokesperson said the six individuals wanted for alleged national security offences has continued to endanger national security after fleeing to the United Kingdom. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757045_1_20240612095301.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people wanted here for alleged national security offences have been stripped of their SAR passports under homegrown national security legislation passed in March.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People will also be barred from providing funds and resources to the six, dealing with assets and property owned by the fugitives, or entering into a joint venture with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those found in violation of the order against Nathan Law, Mung Siu-tat, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng, Johnny Fok and Tony Choi face seven years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mung and Choi have also been temporarily removed from their posts as company directors, while authorities also ordered a temporary suspension of qualification to practise for Fok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said security secretary Chris Tang issued the order against the six according to the national security law, after they fled to the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These lawless wanted criminals are hiding in the United Kingdom and continue to blatantly engage in activities that endanger national security. They also make scaremongering remarks to smear and slander the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More so, they continue to collude with external forces to protect their evil deeds. We therefore have taken such measure to give them a strong blow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Tang said the cancellation of passports did not violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Immigration Department will, according to our law, cancel their passports. And there's a well-established mechanism among different countries regarding how to notify the cancellation of passports," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's absolutely no contravention to the covenant... according to all those covenants, there are exceptions because of national security grounds. This is not just applicable to Hong Kong, but applies to all civilised societies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With some of the six active on fundraising platforms, the security secretary warned that people could breach the order by giving monetary support to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an offence to provide funds or to handle funds for those specified absconders, no matter what platform it is," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said authorities must take action against the six, whom he said Britain was harbouring, adding that officials could issue similar orders in future when necessary.

 Hong Kong University's faculty of medicine on Tuesday said it had developed a new technique which would make it faster to identify the precise treatment for liver cancer patients.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using three-dimensional bio-printing, researchers produced cube-shaped models which mimicked tumours or cancerous cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different drugs would then be administered to see which was most effective, saving the need for patients to go through clinical trials, as well as precious time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will be very important in developing new treatments, or screen new drugs for the cancer patients, especially in new therapy," said Professor Man Kwan, who led the study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To produce a "liver-in-cube", researchers must first collect tissue samples from the patient. The samples are then processed into "bio-ink", the essential ingredient for bio-printing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to half a dozen cubes can be produced to speed up drug screening, as well as learn about the tumour's reaction to different treatments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Man believed the technique could be applied to other types of cancer too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This technology can be applied on different cancers - not only for liver cancer, [but also] lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer as well," the surgeon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technique is undergoing pre-clinical studies to affirm its safety and efficacy. Man would not disclose the cost for patients, citing confidentiality agreements with potential partners.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the Bar Association and the Law Society on Tuesday expressed confidence towards Hong Kong's judicial independence, following an opinion piece by a former non-permanent judge of the city's top court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lord Jonathan Sumption, who has resigned as a judge of the Court of Final Appeal, penned an article in the Financial Times which mentioned Hong Kong's rule of law and a recent ruling in a landmark subversion trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bar Association said the city has faced numerous challenges over the past few years and the judiciary's role has "never been more important".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [association] has every confidence in the independence of our judiciary and we urge the public to support the work of our judges and every effort to safeguard judicial independence and to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is also important to appreciate that our judges can only decide cases on the basis of the legal arguments advanced and the evidence before them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association added that it would not comment on specific cases, particularly those which are currently under judicial consideration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the retirement of Madam Justice Beverley McLachlin from the top court, the legal body expressed its gratitude towards the former Canadian top judge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are grateful for her contributions to the rule of law and administration of justice in Hong Kong since she was first appointed to the [Court of Final Appeal] in 2018. We echo the sentiment in her statement regarding her confidence in the members of the court, their independence and their determination to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Law Society also expressed confidence in the judiciary, with its new president, Roden Tong, highlighting its independence and the city's robust legal system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about Lord Sumption's opinion piece, Tong said legal professionals should refrain from making political comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as a legal professional, one should always remember that our duty to discharging our duties has to be apolitical – commenting simply from a legal perspective and not from any political lens," he said.

    'Cathay cadet training to resume if conditions met'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Tuesday said solo flight training for its cadets would resume once they follow the flying school's requirements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  AeroGuard Flight Training Centre, a pilot training school in the United States, reportedly suspended all solo flights for Cathay cadets, after some failed to report incidents while out flying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline's general manager flying Tim Burns said training for cadets would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's many different areas which need to be trained. Solo flying is just one small proportion. So the students will continue on the rest of their training," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some will have some of their solo flying delayed, while AeroGuard ensures that the cadets are aware of how to report any incidents and that everyone does follow the requirements of the flying school, and once that's satisfied, then they will resume the solo flying."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Cathay said the last of its aircraft, that was stored during the pandemic, is back in Hong Kong - marking a milestone for the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR’s flag carrier said 85 of its passenger aircraft were parked outside of Hong Kong due to the impact of the pandemic. One of these locations was Alice Springs in Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex McGowan, the airline's chief operations and service delivery officer, said bringing the fleet back was a remarkable achievement for the company, with Cathay expecting its passenger flights to return to pre-pandemic level by the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to rebuild, everything in the ecosystem needs to be working in harmony, so our aircraft coming back into service is one aspect. Ensuring that our pilots and our cabin crew are recruited and trained to the right standards after a long period of not flying or not flying regularly is important as well," he said.

    Exco approves 3 percent pay rise for civil servants

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil servants are set to receive an across-the-board pay rise of three percent, backdated to the beginning of April this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive in Council on Tuesday approved the move, with the proposal to be tabled to Legco as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Executive Council said it thoroughly considered the response to the pay rise from government staff, and balanced a number of factors under the adjustment mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include the state of Hong Kong's economy, the government's fiscal position, inflation, pay trend indicators and civil service morale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Civil Service Bureau said the authorities had to be prudent with the adjustment, given the government's current deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the meantime, the vacancy level in the civil service has climbed to 10 percent under a tight labour market. Civil servants of all ranks have shouldered additional responsibilities," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy has recorded actual growth with inflation over the past year. There were also pay rises in private organisations."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Andrew Cheung says striking the right balance between protection of fundamental rights and safeguarding national security can be difficult and outcomes are controversial at times. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756943_1_20240611145227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said on Tuesday that the judiciary is firmly committed to protecting people's fundamental rights and safeguarding national security, adding that he is confident the courts handle appeals with integrity and professionalism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung's statement came in response to an opinion piece by Lord Jonathan Sumption, who resigned as a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Sumption had said in an article published in the Financial Times that the rule of law in Hong Kong was "profoundly compromised in any area about which the government feels strongly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Cheung said that finding the right balance between protecting people's rights and ensuring national security can be challenging and controversial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As in other jurisdictions, a tension often exists between protection of fundamental rights and safeguarding national security, both of which the Hong Kong Judiciary is firmly committed to doing," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Striking the right balance in individual cases can be difficult and outcomes controversial at times. It is one thing to disagree with a court's decision, but it is quite another to suggest that fundamental rights have been compromised because of political concerns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said that while everyone has the right to express their views, public opinions potentially put pressure on or interfere with the courts' administration of justice, and should therefore be expressed with caution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that all judges are obliged to make impartial and independent decisions based on the law and evidence, as stated in their judicial oath.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any suggestion that their decisions have been or may be influenced by extraneous considerations, political or otherwise, is a serious allegation that must be duly substantiated and should not be lightly made," he said.

    Privacy watchdog issues AI adoption guidelines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung says workers should retain control when high-risk AI applications are used to help make decisions. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756939_1_20240611143448.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data on Tuesday issued a set of guidelines for organisations to protect data when using artificial intelligence systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog said local institutions are becoming aware of the privacy risks that AI poses, as more and more of them start making use of such technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost half of all organisations in Hong Kong are expected to use AI this year – up from 30 percent in 2023, according to the Productivity Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said a lot of information needs to be collected to train or operate AI systems and people's privacy will be infringed if these details are leaked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the new Model Personal Data Protection Framework details steps organisations should take when procuring and using any AI system that makes use of personal details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, institutions are advised to minimise the collection of personal data, conduct rigorous testing of their system, ensure data security and devise an incident response plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said organisations should also let workers retain control when high-risk AI applications are used to help make decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the use of the AI system involves the collection of biometric data, of course that would be a high-risk scenario. And if the AI system is to provide recommendations on the granting of credit to individuals or institutions, that would also be a high-risk scenario," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, if the AI system is only used to provide basic information relating to the services or products of the organisation, such as information provided by an AI chatbot, the risk would be lower."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung added that organisations should also offer their customers adequate information on their AI systems and allow them to access, correct or delete their data.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers are set to travel and visit exhibitions at no cost while enjoying a raft of discounts on July 1, as part of celebrations to mark the 27th anniversary of the city's return to the motherland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Revealing the celebration plans at a press briefing ahead of this week's Executive Council meeting, Chief Executive John Lee said all tram and light rail journeys will be free, as well as some bus services in the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of MTR routes will be free for children aged between three and 11, while residents will be welcome to use various indoor and outdoor facilities run by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who are interested in arts and history can get free access to the regular and standard exhibitions at the Hong Kong Science Museum, Hong Kong Space Museum and M+ Museum, as well as special exhibitions at the Hong Kong Museum of Art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, all exhibitions at the Hong Kong Palace Museum will be free, and there will be no charge to get into the Hong Kong Wetland Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to Ocean Park will get 30 percent off their tickets between June 29 and July 1, and children as well as the elderly will get discounted tickets when they take the Peak Tram on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over a thousand restaurants will roll out discounts on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that more details will be revealed by various government departments and organisations at a later date.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dragonboat teams throughout Hong Kong had spent months preparing for Monday's Tuen Ng Festival races. One of those teams was Hong Kong's only dragonboat crew made up primarily of the visually impaired – the Darkness Fighters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their mantra is to "challenge the impossible", and their goal: to create a blind-friendly sports environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our reporter Anne Chan attended the Fighters' training sessions to see how members of the team were able to conquer their limitations by rowing together.
