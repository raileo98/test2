<div class="itemFullText">
 The American restaurant chain Outback Steakhouse announced it will shut down nine of its 19 outlets in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outback said the affected eateries are located in Causeway Bay, Central, Mong Kok and other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will stay open until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, the chain described it as a difficult business decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We remain committed to Hong Kong market with our 10 branches and will continue to serve customers with the same commitment to quality and excellence that they have come to expect from the Outback brand," the chain added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority said Outback has not made MPF contributions to about 40 employees in May and June, totalling around HK$60,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said it urged the chain to settle outstanding MPF payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority added that it has not received any complaints from Outback staff.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Laos signed 12 MOUs to boost cooperation during Chief Executive John Lee's visit to the Asean member state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in a media briefing in the capital Vientiane on Monday evening as he wrapped his visit to Laos, he said there's room for the two sides to further enhance ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our two-day visit in Laos is fruitful. We have a total of 12 MOUs being exchanged, from trade and economic partnership, investment promotion, Customs collaboration, education exchange, logistics cooperation, to financial services and air services development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, I believe Hong Kong and Laos will have huge potentials and opportunities for cooperation, and there's ample room to grow in terms of trade and people-to-people exchange."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that Hong Kong is an ideal platform for Laotian companies to tap into the Greater Bay Area market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that more cooperation between both the business sector between the two places and people-to-people exchange will help produce good benefits to the two peoples," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also thanked Laos for supporting Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the visit, he met with the leaders of Laos and visited places such as Vientiane Secondary School where students have been learning Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech at the school, he said Polytechnic University has signed an MOU with the school, offering scholarships to high-achieving students so that they can study at the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also pointed out Hong Kong recently relaxed the visa policy for Laotian talent to work or study in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee will head to Cambodia on Tuesday on the next leg of his three-nation visit which also includes Vietnam.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Monday flocked to shopping malls and government facilities to watch Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and other SAR athletes in action.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people were at a shopping mall in Kwun Tong to watch the live-stream of the Games on a giant screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the spectators was Valerie, who was there with her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really exciting, because there are people cheering when the athletes won or scored a point. I think this is really different (from) watching at home," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another spectator, Ena, said she was there to cheer on all the Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, their performance has been really motivational to all the Hong Kong citizens. Just wonderful to see more Hong Kong people step into the Olympics, like be the Olympians, and participate in such a big event," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, who was watching Cheung's bouts, said he was moved by the perseverance of the home-grown athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they are so hardworking. They put a lot of efforts on it. We should really support them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and star swimmer Siobhan Haughey are among those in action on day three of the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Edgar Cheung on Monday easily booked his spot in the last 16 of men’s foil individual event at the Grand Palais in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer beat Daniel Gu of Canada 15-5 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung went ahead by seven points before his Canadian opponent started striking back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he could not narrow the deficit and Cheung went on to win in the opening three-minute period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This was the plan. We knew this opponent is a strong opponent but I knew if Cheung Ka-long is at his level, he can defeat easily and this was the plan,” said Cheung's coach Gregory Koenig after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will take on China's Mo Zewei next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I really wanted Ka-long to keep focus, to stay focus on every point even if the score was very high difference, to keep focusing, to keep fighting to be fully prepared for the next match, which is going to be to very tough against Mo Ziwei,” Koenig added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gu said he treasured the opportunity to take on an Olympic champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is no point being mad or upset about it. I already knew going into this, I am not a favourite to win, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like to get beat by someone that good,” said Gu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was fun. It is always a learning experience so all the hits and points he gets on me, there is a reason why he is an Olympic champion.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two SAR table tennis players, Wong Chun-ting and Zhu Chengzhu, on Monday won their singles matches at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw, Wong beat Ibrahima Diaw of Senegal in a nail-biter in a round of 64 match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair split the first six games, including a marathon second game lasting 14 minutes in favour of Wong, 18-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong prevailed in the seventh and deciding game, 11-4, to make it through to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, I feel satisfied with my performance today," he said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it was tough, but there were also some surprises... My opponent was in form quickly and acted more decisively, creating a lot of big difficulties for me. So it’s a good thing that I quickly adjusted my game, and luckily I won the second game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Zhu's victory in her round of 64 match was a more straight-forward affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She swept Chien Tung-chuan of Chinese Taipei 11-7, 11-7, 11-7, 12-10.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Cindy Cheung was on Monday eliminated in the first round of women’s 100m backstroke in the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She finished fifth in her heat at the Paris La Defense Arena in 1 min 3.45 secs, which put her 29th among 36 contestants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fastest 16 swimmers qualify for the semifinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff and Regan Smith from the United States and Australian Kaylee McKeown are in the top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though the time isn't the most satisfactory, I will still say it's a great opportunity, and I'm just grateful that I get to finally say that I've competed in the Olympics," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of performance, and may be like handling the nerves, I think there's still much to improve on, that I can learn from other more experienced swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yeah, I'm just here as a learning experience and to enjoy my time here."

 The Customs and Excise Department on Monday said its computer forensic lab is looking into the use of artificial intelligence to enhance efficiency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Senior Inspector Wong Wai-kei said the lab handles over 100 cases every year, noting a rise in complexity and case volume owing to big data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that customs are working to boost the accuracy of its technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The accuracy of our system is around 80 percent. This 80 percent figure is based on our previous training data. This accuracy can be influenced by various factors, such as data volume or complexity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, our technical personnel are currently fine-tuning this system. We hope to improve our data model and increase accuracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the technology would help with the analysis of digital evidence, such as text, images, and videos.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Industry representatives on Monday expressed mixed feelings about business sentiment during the Olympics, despite seeing a boost in foot traffic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Allan Zeman, chairman of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, told RTHK that he expects bar takings to surge as much as 10 percent during the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people might feel in the mood to spend after fencer Vivian Kong won a gold medal, but their elation wouldn't last long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If they're happier, then they will be in a better mood to either buy retail or if they're in a bar with friends watching the Olympics, normally it's conducive to spending some money. I'd say if anything, it'll be maybe a 10 percent [sales increase] at best, but it's not going to be a huge game changer,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zeman said he doesn't believe the Games will persuade people to keep spending more in the long-run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Unfortunately, once the Games finish, then I think people will go back to normal,” he said, adding that the key to bringing back a “vibrant nightlife scene in the city” relies on hosting more international events to attract tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties’ leasing department said the apm mall in Kwun Tong, which is showing the Games, saw an increase in foot traffic of at least 10 percent over Saturday and Sunday, compared to the previous weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fund told an RTHK programme that she believes the public became more engaged with the Olympics from the Tokyo Games, when they enjoyed watching the events together in malls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that he saw a surge in customers at restaurants with televisions on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects a 15 to 20 percent overall increase in business during the Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said his administration has been focusing its attention on economic development and that business is a "win-win" situation for all, as he met with Lao officials as part of his third trip to Asean countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee is leading a delegation to Laos, the first stop of a six-day visit to three nations that also includes Cambodia and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee met Laos' deputy prime minister and foreign minister Saleumxay Kommasith, witnessing the signing of a number of memoranda of understanding between the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that business is always a win-win situation for the people of both places, and I have been focusing the whole government and society's energy and attention on strengthening economic development and business," Lee said during the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of my visit to Laos on this occasion is, first of all, to strengthen ties between government and government, and of course, strengthen ties between business and business, and also very importantly, strengthen ties between people and people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kommasith, for his part, pointed to a new action plan signed by President Xi Jinping and General-Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Thongloun Sisoulith last year, saying it will be a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kommasith also said the country is committed to working with the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a good opportunity for me and the [Lao People's Democratic Republic], both the government as well as the business community, to discuss and find a way to further expand economic trade cooperation in the [Lao People's Democratic Republic] and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also met Laotian Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, who welcomed the SAR delegation and called the visit a milestone on economic, cultural, trade and investment cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On social media, the chief executive thanked Laos for supporting Hong Kong's bid for accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the volume of trade and investment flows between Laos and Hong Kong have ample room to grow. We see much prospect for deeper collaboration of our economic relations as both economies place importance to the developments of green economy and digital economy," Lee wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three women and two men have been arrested over the suspected murder of a 33-year-old man in Jordan, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man was found unconscious on Pilkem Street on Sunday morning and was later declared dead after being taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they think the alleged attack, which happened after the man left a suspected illegal gambling den at around 2am, could have been linked to a personal dispute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant District Commander Ching Chi-yan said the force suspects the victim was struck multiple times about the head with a hammer, adding that cracks were found in the back of the man's skull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man, 40, and a woman, 32, were arrested on suspicion of murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other women and a man, aged between 34 and 56, were suspected of assisting an offender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All five were being held in detention as police continued their investigation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencer Vivian Kong will inspire young people to follow their dreams and take up sport as a career, according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, took Hong Kong's third ever Olympics gold when she won the individual women's épée in Paris at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louie said the world number one is helping to promote sports development by raising the profile and popularity of fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think fencing as an Olympic sport has to get established among young people... It (Kong's victory) can encourage more people, especially young people, to engage in physical activity and eventually to improve their overall physical and mental health as well," he said on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong pulled out of the Asian Championships quarter-finals last month due to a knee injury, and underwent surgery for torn anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louie said the fencer was lucky to be able to return to elite level after the injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sports medicine and literature indicates that maybe around 60 to 70 percent of the athletes can return to elite level," he said, adding that full credit for her recovery must go to her medical team for their "very good strategic rehabilitation plan".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some elite players, or maybe like soccer players, if you have an ACL injury, you may end your football career," Louie noted.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey made it to the women’s 200m freestyle final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first 100 metres, Haughey maintained a steady top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to narrow the gap and finished third in the second semi-final of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 minute, 55.51 seconds was the fourth fastest overall, earning her one of eight spots in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final will take place in the early hours of Tuesday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey’s main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday, and Ariarne Titmus, who holds the world and Olympic records in the event and defended her title in the 400m free on the first day of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m free at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago and won the world title in the 200 freestyle earlier this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's badminton pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have staved off elimination from the Paris Olympics, after beating their American counterparts in a grueling match in the early hours of Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR shuttlers recovered a day after losing their opener against a pair from Bulgaria, to beat US twins Kerry and Annie Xu 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by eight points at one point, the SAR duo went on a 12-4 run to close the first game 24-22, saving four game points in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xus fought one back, 21-17, taking advantage of the Hong Kong pair's mistakes in quick succession towards the end of the second game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As fatigue appeared to affect the Americans more, the Hong Kong shuttlers won the decider, 21-11, for their first point of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Yeungs will battle Team China's Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the SAR loses, the pair will need the Americans to beat the Bulgarian sisters, Gabriela and Stefani Stoeva, by a wide margin for them to have a chance to advance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting are one win away from a medal at the Paris Olympics, after advancing to the mixed doubles semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They defeated Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao of Spain 4-2 in the quarter-finals on Sunday at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair dropped the first game 9-11, but they won the next two games 11-9 and 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth game saw a suspenseful back and forth with the Spanish team securing that game 12-10, but Doo and Wong fought back in the next game winning 11-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team ultimately took the win 11-8 in the last game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the final four is Hong Kong's best result in this event and Wong said they were glad to have made the breakthrough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I'm just excited like everyone else is. Because at the previous games we went out in the last eight, and now we've made a breakthrough to enter the semifinals," he told reporters post-game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very difficult match. We've lost to them before. This time we gained our revenge. Ah Doo performed very well on the table. I trusted her 120 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Doo, it was the perfect tonic after losing her first-round singles match earlier in the day to North Korea's Pyon Song-gyong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo will square off against the North Korean team again in the semis on Monday when she and Wong face Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong at 10pm Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Koreans had defeated the world number two pair of Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan in an earlier round.

 Hong Kong skiff sailors found themselves in second to last place after completing the first day of their Paris Olympics races on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth ranked 19th out of 20 teams in the event after three races in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They started off with 17 points in the first race, and improved to 12 points in the second. The final event of the day didn't turn out as well, as the pair finished with 19 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sailors with the fewest points win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China's pair of Wen Zaiding and Liu Tian are tenth after race day one, while New Zealanders Isaac McHardie and William McKenzie have taken the top spot so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The medal rounds are due to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the windsurfing competitions were postponed for the day due to a lack of wind. Hong Kong's Alex Cheng and Mui Ma are in the men's and women's events, respectively.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The maiden Olympic journeys of two SAR fencers, Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho, came to an end on Sunday, but both earned praise from their coaches for their strong performances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nineteen-year-old Chan bowed out of the women's foil individual event after she was beaten 15-8 by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16 at the Grand Palais in Paris. It's still the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong competitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sauer seized a 5-4 advantage after a back-and-forth first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world No 6 from Germany continued to impress in the second round, extending the lead to 10-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was too big a deficit for Chan, ranked 31st in the world, to overcome, but she said after the match that making it this far is already a huge accomplishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy I could reach top 16 and I think I enjoyed the stage so much, the atmosphere was amazing, and I'm very happy that I completed my first Olympics in a really good way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her coach Gregory Koenig applauded the teenage fencer for her performance, adding that Chan has the capability to compete at the highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know people can be disappointed because she doesn't bring a medal to Hong Kong. But we have to be honest, she fenced very well. She showed us she has the ability to have an amazing mindset for this kind of event, at 19 years old, her first Olympic Games," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Psychologically, she can be a great champion. Now she still has to work on the technical skills, the tactical skills, all the physical part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When all these are perfectly set out, if she can keep this mindset, she can really be in the top of the world and bring a medal in the next Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan had edged out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Hong Kong Olympic debutant, Cedric Ho, lost to Masaru Yamada of Japan 15-9 in the men's épée.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho was off to a quick start in their round of 32 match, racing to a 5-2 lead at the end of the first period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamada rallied in the next period, tying the score at 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer faltered in the third and final period which his Japanese opponent won 7-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all the times I have competed against him, I have never had a lead of more than five points. After the draw, I knew he was difficult to beat, but I wanted to try my best," Ho said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a big lead before I was overtaken, which I regret."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said Ho gave an exceptional performance despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that he was himself. That's the most important thing," he said. "The only regret is he didn't believe enough. My old coach used to say these are the moments you are more afraid of winning than losing."

  <br/>
  Haughey came second in her heat, 0.10 secs behind China's Li Bingjie.

  <br/>
  Her time of 1 min 56.38 secs was the fifth fastest overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey will compete in the semifinals, early Monday Hong Kong time.

 Hong Kong fencer Daphne Chan made a winning Olympic debut on Sunday at the Grand Palais in Paris, edging out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the women’s foil individual round of 32.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was a tight back-and-forth affair early on before Chan started widening the gap, ending the first period with a 7-4 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan scored an early point in the next round to extend her lead, but Azuma refused to go quietly, picking up a few points to tie the score at 11 at the end of the second period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third and final period was also a closely fought battle, with the 19-year-old SAR fencer emerging victorious over her Japanese rival ranked 19 places above her.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem was on Sunday eliminated in the first round of the women's singles at the Paris Olympics, losing 4-1 to North Korea's Pyon Song Gyong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time SAR Olympian started off the round of 64 match losing two straight games 8-11 and 7-11, before fighting back and winning the third 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the North Korean won two more games 11-7 and 11-4 and sent Doo packing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Doo, who won bronze as part of the SAR's women's team at the Tokyo Games, will play in the mixed doubles quarter-finals with teammate Wong Chun-ting later on Sunday. They will take on the Spanish duo of Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao for a spot in the semi-finals.

    Crowds at Prince Edward amid partial MTR suspension

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR says there were larger-than-normal crowds at Prince Edward station. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763535_1_20240728165335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said there were larger crowds on Sunday at Prince Edward station than normal because of a partial suspension of services, but made it clear crowd-control measures were in place to facilitate travel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rail company suspended services between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on the Kwun Tong Line to carry out large-scale tunnel asset renewal work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four affected stations – Prince Edward, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei and Ho Man Tin – are still being served by either the Tsuen Wan Line or the Tuen Ma Line, while Prince Edward is the only interchange station between the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at Yau Ma Tei station, Cheris Lee, the MTR's chief of operating and metro segment, says staff have been told to be proactive in assisting passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she believed the impact of suspension will be minimised, with the maintenance work being carried out on a Sunday during the summer vacation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Passengers can still use our alternative routes to all stations today," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR deployed more than 1,000 staff to facilitate operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement later in the day, the firm described the overall situation on Sunday as smooth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One passenger, surnamed Wong, said the suspension should have happened on a weekday, given the number of mainland tourists and foreign domestic helpers who were off on Sunday. "At least during the weekdays, there will be fewer people, at least fewer mainlanders... this (the suspension along with the rain) would create a more negative impact to Hong Kong's image," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR also reminded passengers who are travelling to Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau on the East Rail Line to be 20 to 30 minutes early, to ensure they'll catch the last train.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Sunday advanced to the quarterfinals of the men's single sculls at the Paris Olympics after finishing second in his repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu finished two seconds behind Sid Ali Boudina of Algeria, clocking 7 minutes and 12.94 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR rower was in second place through the first 500 metres, but dropped to third for the next kilometre. He picked up the pace in the final stretch and overtook Bermuda's Dara Alizadeh for second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have earned the respect of many competitors, because they thought Hong Kong's rowing team might not be able to perform well and be competitive in open events. But I showed them that I was capable to reach the quarterfinals," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had finished out of the running in Saturday's heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterfinals are set to be held on Tuesday.

  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV programme, Yau said Hong Kong can offer professional services to these countries.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday began a six-day trip to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to further explore business opportunities there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport before leaving for Laos, Lee said he will persuade the three Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries to back Hong Kong's inclusion in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will meet with local leaders to introduce Hong Kong's economic development and opportunities, and I will continue to seek their support for us to join the RCEP," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second, we will promote economic and trade exchanges in different regions. We will present Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a 'super value-adder,' showcasing what we can offer such as professional services, our experience, our connections, and how we can guide them to benefit from opportunities in Hong Kong and also enter the mainland market and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted that the combined population of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam totals around 120 million, describing them as a huge market and business prospect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's delegation includes some 30 leaders from various business and technology sectors.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the upcoming economic figures indicate sustained growth in Hong Kong's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a blog post, Chan said the government will this week unveil GDP figures for the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that both exports and investments have shown continual growth, attributed to an uptick in external demand and a surge in the nation's overall exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the finance minister expressed optimism that challenges from geopolitics will likely diminish, which will benefit investment and asset markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the stable growth of the mainland economy will provide significant support to Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also hoped that a series of exhibitions and large-scale events will bring in more tourists and consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the finance chief congratulated épée fencer Vivian Kong for securing Hong Kong's first Paris Olympics gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, Chan said Kong has showcased her exceptional skills and perseverance in her comeback victory, making all Hongkongers thrilled and excited.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing queen Vivian Kong on Sunday won the women's epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics in the most dramatic fashion, defeating local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in a fence-off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Frenchwoman, ranked sixth in the world, started off strong, taking a 7-1 lead in the second round after taking the first 4-0, to the delight of the home crowd, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at the Grand Palais.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With momentum fully on Mallo-Breton's side, world number one Kong changed sword in an apparent attempt to regroup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China athlete then fenced on a 9-3 run to tie the score at 10-10 in the middle of the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencers took the score to 12-12 for the one-minute fence off, and Kong struck first to take home the SAR's first gold medal at this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what went through her mind when she clawed back from the big deficit, Kong said she didn't want to "lose ugly" and not be able to fence with "the Hong Kong spirit".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also thanked people in Hong Kong for showing support. "Thank you for staying up and watching, and I know, I'm so grateful," Kong told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really thankful, I'm really grateful, I'm just so lucky because every [fencer] deserves it, in fencing anything can happen, I love all the girls here, I just can't believe it's me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tearful Kong also said that in the past, she was afraid of losing and got more nervous. But she now believed that, as she's worked to the best of her abilities and everyone around her has done their best to support her, she no longer had to sweat herself out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong fencer's coach for the past nine years, Octavian Zidaru, said he thinks Kong has made amazing progress and overcame lots of injuries to reach the top of the Olympic podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Kong now has many moves and tactics at her disposal, and in the past month he's tried to just calm her nerves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last month, I tried not to put any pressure on her, even in Hong Kong," Zidaru told reporters. "I told her, 'we participate in this Olympic Games like in any other competition.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's only the third Hong Kong gold in history and follows fellow fencer Edgar Cheung's foil victory in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee sent his congratulations, while the sports minister, Kevin Yeung, said after watching the final in Paris that he was "touched and delighted by her performance and demeanour of a great athlete".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as Macron, spectators who saw Kong's triumph included US First Lady Jill Biden and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong will be the first Hong Kong, China medallist of the 2024 Paris Olympics after a dramatic semi-final victory in the women's epee in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one defeated Estonia's Nelli Differt 15-11 in a nail-biting semi-final that saw the lead change hands frequently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first period started with a tight back and forth tussle that resulted in a two-all tie. That intensity continued into the second period, as the two players went neck to neck but Kong was able to move herself up on the scoreboard 8-7 by the end of that spell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong successfully widened the gap in the final round, adding seven points to pull herself into the gold medal bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencing queen is the second person from the SAR to win a fencing medal after Tokyo champion Edgar Cheung, and the first in the epee discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gold or silver will be Hong Kong first ever medal in women's fencing. She'll face local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in the final at 3.30am, Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting advanced to the last eight in the mixed doubles event, defeating their Hungarian opponents 4-1 in their opening match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo jumped out to a 2-0 lead, before Dora Madarasz and Nandor Ecseki clawed a game back 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hungarians lost the fourth game 11-6 as the SAR duo stormed their way to take the final game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our belief never wavered. We hope we can play every point well. And in the end, we managed to do that," Wong told reporters in the post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair will face Maria Xiao and Alvaro Robles from Spain in the quarter-finals on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong gymnast Stone Shek was unable to make it to the final round in vault, finishing 12th in the qualifying round with eight athletes making the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He miscued his first jump after landing on his feet and needed to use his hands to regain his balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shek, who was making his third Olympic appearance after London and Tokyo, ended up with a score of 14.099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite not advancing further, the gymnast, 32, said Paris was a very good experience which he found to be the most enjoyable and pressure free in his 20 odd years in the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because vault after all is a little bit like gambling. No matter how good you do during practice, when you can't make the move during the competition, you can't," Shek told reporters.

 Hong Kong's world number one fencer, Vivian Kong, is another step closer to reaching the Olympic podium, after sweeping Ukraine's Olena Kryvytska in the quarter-finals of the women's individual epee on Saturday at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong started the first round with a strong 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian was able to come back with four points, but the SAR fencing star fought back hard to finish the second period 9-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong then eased her way into the final four with six additional points in the final round to win 15-7, making this bout her best performance so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competition now moves onto the podium piste for the beginning of the semi-finals, where Kong will take on Nelli Differt, the 12th-ranked fencer from Estonia, in the semi-final at 1am Hong Kong time.
  <br/>

 Hong Kong badminton stars Tse Ying-suet and Jordan Tang made a triumphant start to the Paris Olympics on Saturday, defeating their counterparts from Chinese Taipei 2-0 in their mixed doubles opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair from the SAR beat Lee Chia-hsin and Ye Hong-wei 21-13, 21-13 in their Group C game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse and Tang will next play Japan's pair of Arisa Higashino and Yuta Watanabe, whom they lost to in the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three duos are fighting for two spots in the knockout stages. A Danish pair who would've also competed in the group withdrew from the Games earlier this month after one of them had issues reporting his whereabouts in line with anti-doping regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on the badminton courts, Hong Kong's women's double pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Nga-lam suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Bulgaria's Gabriela Stoeva and Stefani Stoeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bulgarians won 21-11, 21-23 and 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong pair are next in action against the Americans Annie Xu and Kerry Xu on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong judoka Wong Ka-lee on Saturday bowed out from the Olympics, losing 10-0 to Austrian Katharina Tanzer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong was eliminated in the women’s 48-kilogramme competition by Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she was disappointed with her performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could have performed better, because I thought I had a chance after the draw. I hope I could do better next time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank [my coach and my younger brother] for encouraging me all the time... I was very nervous before the match, but they tried to help me relax."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was competing in the Games for the first time and marked the return of a Hong Kong judoka in the Olympics after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team remained in last place for most of the race, before overcoming Ireland to claim seventh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au – who's taking part in her fifth Olympics – said the team had put in "100 percent of hard work" to prepare for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On competing in the future, the swimmer said: "I just wanted to swim well this time, simply focus on doing well in the competition, and think about the rest later."

  <br/>
  The match began with a tight first period with Kong trailing by only one point, 2-3, but she was able to overcome the deficit and took control by the end of the second period with a lead of 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the final round, Kong secured the win by scoring three points in the final minute to get her a spot in the round of 16, where she will face Hadley Husisian of the US.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds on Saturday flocked to shopping malls to catch the livestream of the first day of action at the Paris Olympics Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At Kwun Tong's apm shopping mall, a woman surnamed Tong said she became more interested in the Games since fencer Edgar Cheung won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also had a message for epee fencer Vivian Kong, who competes on Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We Hongkongers support Hongkongers. I think she's really into fencing and participating in the Olympics is something she wants to achieve. I hope she has a good result and a good [experience]." she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boy surnamed Auyeung, who had just participated in a swimming competition near the mall, said he is really excited about Siobhan Haughey competing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because she swims really fast… I hope to become a swimmer one day as well,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties said many people had gathered at the mall to support their favourite athletes, even before the SAR squad’s events took place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said she expects foot traffic and business at the mall to increase by 10 to 15 percent year-on-year over the next two days, adding that the mall will offer various discounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said the mall plans to broadcast the games from 11am to 11pm.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Saturday narrowly missed out on qualifying for the next round at the Paris Olympics, but moves on to the repechage for another chance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-time Olympian finished second-last in his men's single sculls heat, clocking a time of 7:00.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said he was satisfied with his performance, which he described as "above-average".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finishing in seven minutes is a rather good time. I had the fastest time [going into the repechage] out of all six heats, so I hope I could perform like this again in the repechage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it's a pity that I was so close yet so far, and missed the quarter-finals by one spot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who is the first SAR athlete to compete in the Paris Games, will next compete in Sunday's repechage.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Saturday said there were at least two cases of flooding in Hong Kong after the Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued in the morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department said it has so far confirmed two flooding cases for the day. One of them was at the junction of Sau Mau Ping Road and Hip Wo Street, near United Christian Hospital, which has since been cleaned up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said two women aged 26 and 59, sustained injuries to their limbs after slipping at the scene. They were both sent to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second case of flooding occurred at Shau Kei Wan Main Street East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department also deployed over 40 emergency teams to inspect flooding blackspots throughout the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued on Saturday morning at 9am and was in effect until 12.50pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several districts recorded over 30mm of rainfall in the morning, while the eastern part of the territory recorded more than 40mm of rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downpour came as an active southwest monsoon brought showers and thunderstorms to the coast of Guangdong and the northern part of the South China Sea.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB has reported an increase in the number of stray or abandoned dogs. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763404_1_20240727145900.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal rescue organisations on Saturday said rapid land development in Hung Shui Kiu and Kwu Tung has resulted in a significant rise in stray and abandoned dogs, creating a strain on overcrowded shelters and posing public health risks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paws Guardian Rescue Shelter volunteer Kent Luk said that there has been an influx in animal abandonment in the past six months due to an increase in land resumption projects in the North District, noting that the shelter currently has over 300 stray dogs and 150 cats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB called for government support and the implementation of long-term, large-scale animal shelters that provide more adoption, medical care and animal welfare services to reduce the number of strays on the streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The running cost of a shelter in Hong Kong is so high, including the cost of land and labour costs... that is why we recommend the government provide more financial support," said District Councillor Corey Lau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau spoke about the importance of balancing urban development with the need to protect animal rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to balance development with animal rights because we think that animal rights will also affect the lives of humans," he added.

    Digital Policy Office to help SMEs adopt technology

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tony Wong says a pilot scheme will help catering and retail businesses to adopt technology. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763397_1_20240727120429.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Digital Policy Commissioner Tony Wong on Saturday said the newly established Digital Policy Office will aim to help small and medium sized firms (SMEs) adopt new tech to boost competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong said the office, which is under the Innovation, Technology & Industry Bureau, has three major focus areas, including developing technology-related policies, creating a digital government, and promoting the use of technology in public services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He mentioned that HK$500 million has been earmarked for a digital transition pilot scheme for SMEs in Cyberport. The office will first subsidise the retail and catering sectors to digitalise their operations by installing customer management, marketing, and electronic payment systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The main purpose is to help SMEs learn how to apply basic technology or applications. These applications don't require any changes; they are like items on a supermarket shelf – you can pick and use them immediately,” he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The two industries often interact with many residents and tourists. By starting with them, we believe we will see results quickly. They also frequently encounter pain points and difficulties, such as a lack of manpower."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also spoke on the recent incident where Microsoft experienced a failure in updating its antivirus system, wreaking havoc on firms around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that while the government’s system was not affected by the incident, it indicates the importance of having backup systems and a reminder for all government departments to conduct regular tests.

    'Cross-border organ transfer should be regularised'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health minister said on Saturday the administration is currently in discussion with mainland authorities to streamline cross-border organ transfer arrangements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the Hong Kong Children's Hospital received a cord blood unit from Guangzhou on Thursday to treat a five-year-old girl who suffers from thalassaemia. The patient could undergo surgery in October at the earliest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Chung-mau said on a Commercial Radio programme that the Health Bureau hopes to eliminate the procedure of having to file an application with mainland authorities and await approval for each cross-boundary organ transplant case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only a short amount of time is available when organ transplant is needed [to save a patient]. Regularisation of organ transfer arrangements can help patients find a suitable organ quickly. It would be best if authorities of two regions can notify the other whenever there is no suitable organ recipients in their area," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the health chief noted that the difference in immigration control regulations on organs poses a challenge towards the regularisation process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lo said the government will further develop the SAR's rare disease centre by collaborating with the mainland, so children with diseases in Hong Kong can be given the best treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a rare disease centre in the Children's Hospital with the expertise, the geneticists, and also clinicians who are experts in these genetic disease... in collaboration with the mainland we are developing a rare disease centre, so hopefully in the future our babies and kids with diseases, they will be given the best of care," he said.

    Govt to revise subsidised flat scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said the government will look into ways to revise a pilot scheme that lets developers take on the role of building subsidised housing flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the administration rejected a tender for a residential site in Chai Wan earlier this week, after only one bid, which failed to meet the government's reserve price, was received.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cheung Man Road site is earmarked for at least 700 units with the government setting the price at 65 percent of the market value – with any unsold units to be kept by the developer to sell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, the housing minister said the administration is open to suggestions from the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest rate wasn't lowered as expected so developers feel it's very difficult after doing their calculations. For other terms and conditions our industry friends and professional associations can give us some advice. We will take them as a reference. We have other land to choose from, such as different locations, ground area, or unit numbers. That might make a difference. Give us some time to study this," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government is tendering three sites for development under its Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme, which was announced last year to boost supply of subsidised homes by working with private developers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its unique advantages to promote new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a seminar on new quality productive forces, Chan said Hong Kong needs to work with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly, we should actively make good use of Hong Kong's advantages as an international financial hub to strengthen all-round capital support for new quality productive forces. Secondly, it's to attract professionals and firms to here," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thirdly, we need to enhance our cooperation with the brother cities in the Greater Bay Area. That will definitely inject momentum into new quality productive forces and high quality development in the area."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event, Dean of the Institute of Contemporary China Studies of Tsinghua University, Hu Angang, said Hong Kong has an increasingly important role to play in the nation's economic modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to transfer the manufacturing sector from the developed areas near the coast towards the mid-west part area, forming a big domestic cycle. But most importantly, we need to encourage local firms, especially manufacturers, to invest and move overseas, forming a so-called international big cycle," he said.

  <br/>
  "This is the main strategy of China's economic modernisation. It is not a single cycle, but two inter-related cycles. The role and status of Hong Kong will not be lowered, but will continue to grow. "
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hu added that the Chinese economy has been growing rapidly and predicted gross domestic product per capita to exceed US$30,000 by 2035.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday appealed to the entire city to rally behind Hong Kong's Olympic athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, the CE highlighted the continued emergence of new talent, adding that he believed all athletes would give their best on the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 35 athletes from Hong Kong, China, will be competing in 13 sports at the upcoming Olympic Games, with more than half of them making their Olympic debut. This not only marks the passing of the torch of Hong Kong sports to the new generation, but also highlights the emergence of new talent in the field," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government has secured the television rights for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These events will be broadcast live on four free-to-air television channels and screened at designated sports centres in all 18 districts, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling for a citywide celebration, Lee urged everyone to unite in cheering on Hong Kong's Olympic athletes.

    Animation-Comic-Game fair begins

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Animation-Comic-Game fair opened its doors on Friday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763285_1_20240726164608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Animation-Comic-Game fair began on Friday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, with hundreds queuing before the doors opened.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 2,000 cosplayers are expected to join the five-day event, with more than 140 exhibitors taking part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Ho, who was at the front of the queue, said he hoped to buy his favourite toys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I started queuing at around 7, as first place tickets require us to be here from 7 to 7.50, so I don’t want to be late. I’m here to buy deadpool toys for my friend, and I’ll take a look at figures and toys. I am expecting to spend around HK$7,000 to HK$8,000,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor surnamed Lam, whose stall features Inside Out 2 merchandise, said the expectation was that 80 percent of goods would be sold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor surnamed Cheng was also optimistic about sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The highlight product will be the plushie from Chikawa, they all are from Japan, they are all very famous in Hong Kong, China and Japan. We also have Mofusand, a very famous IP character in Hong Kong. We hope we can have around HK$1 million in sales,” Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Chung was in the exhibition area, dressed as Kaedehara Kazuha from Genshin Impact. He said he had seen more cosplayers this year, but he had a complaint about the ticket arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The arrangement this year is more complicated. I’m a cosplayer and I have to buy another ticket to get into the cosplayer zone. [It is] somehow too much, but at the same time, it provides a more quiet space for cosplayers and photographers to take pictures, which is a more professional approach,” Chung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nelson Woo, who was dressed as Monster 8 from Kaiju No. 8, was also unhappy with the two separate areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[This year] is the worst. Hall 3 needs to pay [to enter], but [tickets are] only for 2,500 cosplayers. It is too low, [and the organiser] doesn't have any more tickets [for cosplayers]. Last year Hall 3 was free and it was very nice,” Woo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the venue, Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong chief executive officer Leung Chung-pun said the visitor flow was similar to that of previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that organisers aim to provide a pleasant venue for cosplayers to participate in the yearly event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My major concern is the welfare of the cosplayers. The atmosphere is not my major concern, as long as cosplayers have a good environment to enjoy their time here, I am happy,” Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event will run until July 30.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB says it will organise a series of events to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, including screening patriotic movies and offering free Chinese medicine services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A photography competition will enable participants to express how they “love and treasure our home and country” through their work. The winning entries will be showcased in an exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party will also host various technology-related exhibitions in shopping malls across Hong Kong, including one showcasing China-produced electric cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be a poster design competition for secondary students with the theme of “showcasing China's achievements.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will utilise our district network advantage to organise the events,” the party’s chairman Gary Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope every district in Hong Kong can feel the celebratory atmosphere of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB said it will also hold a short video contest to gather tourism ideas that show "the other side of Hong Kong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the contest is not just a celebratory event, but also a response to the concept of “tourism is everywhere in Hong Kong" as expressed by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawmaker said he believes Hong Kong locals are best positioned to identify unique tourism spots within the city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs on Friday said they arrested 18 people this month on suspicion of allowing party room and restaurant customers to stream karaoke songs in breach of copyright laws.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they raided 31 party rooms and one restaurant between July 2 and 25, seizing karaoke song players and four gaming devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisional commander for intellectual property technology crime investigation, Shek Ka-yin, said it is the first time customs has cracked down on people allegedly offering karaoke songs via online streaming platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional cases, party rooms or restaurants are installed with karaoke players preloaded with infringing karaoke songs," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this case, instead, infringing karaoke songs which were preloaded in the karaoke devices were put in a data centre, which used the streaming technology to transfer the infringing karaoke songs to the subject party rooms for use by the customers," Shek alleged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs said two people were charged with infringing copyright and violation of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, while the remaining 16 were released on bail.

    Business leaders have high hopes for Asean trip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Business leaders who will be part of an SAR delegation travelling with Chief Executive John Lee to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam this month say they hope Hong Kong can strengthen ties with the Asean countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Agnes Chan, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said professional services the SAR offers are in demand in many Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Vietnam lacks skilled labour and Hong Kong companies can help them with skill training. As for Laos, I think its infrastructure is lagging behind and needs Hong Kong's expertise in infrastructure development,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that she hopes to secure tax incentives for Hong Kong businesses in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have already established a bilateral tax agreement with Vietnam and Cambodia, but we haven’t secured that with Laos. I am eager to see if there will be further progress,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Chuang, the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, said a survey found that 45 percent of its 120 members operate in Asean countries, with the majority in Vietnam, a small number in Cambodia and just one in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is a good time to visit Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, given the many business opportunities offered in these countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There have been more factories setting up in Cambodia in recent years. The country also has a young population with strong purchasing power,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I also hope to take this opportunity to understand more about Laos. It is a relatively new market and there’s a new railway connecting its capital Vientiane and Kunming. This is the first major cross-border railway connecting China and an Asean country, which has brought Laos loads of people, logistics and capital.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chuang added that large companies in Vietnam can make use of Hong Kong’s role as an international finance centre to raise money.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced on Friday that he has reappointed Eddie Yue as chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chan praised Yue's leadership, highlighting the authority's success in maintaining local monetary and banking stability amid challenges in recent years including black-clad violence and the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that Eddie will continue to lead the HKMA effectively in the coming five years and make further contributions to Hong Kong's financial, economic and social progress," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Yue expressed gratitude for the finance minister's trust, adding that he will strive to maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment, the international financial landscape, and geopolitics are likely to remain complex and uncertain for some time," Yue said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that consolidating and expanding Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is the best way for us to contribute to the prosperity of our country and Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue's new five-year term is set to commence on October 1.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told the visiting Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that the spirit of the rule of law is highly respected in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive's Office said during a meeting on Wednesday, the SAR leader spoke about the territory's current economic situation, business opportunities and market potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that the SAR government would adopt necessary measures to ensure the safety of people in Hong Kong, adding that all its actions abide strictly with local laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Kuleba had called on Lee to prevent Russia from using Hong Kong as a way to circumvent Western sanctions imposed on Moscow for its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kuleba travelled to Hong Kong following more than three hours of talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Guangzhou on Wednesday, which focused on ways to put an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine. (Additional reporting by agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Exhibitors at the media preview for Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong on Thursday said they expect an increase in sales this year, as the fair coincides with the release of this summer's Hollywood blockbusters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual event runs for five days from Friday, about the same time as the premiere of "Deadpool & Wolverine" and Disney's "Inside Out 2" in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 142 exhibitors will participate in the event. One of them, Chow, whose stall featured a statue of Deadpool, along with figures, hats, stickers and plushies, said they expect a 30 percent jump in sales this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another stall owner, Ho, told RTHK they will roll out products related to the Transformers franchise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the 40th anniversary for Transformers so we have some highlighted products for Transformers. Also for Marvel, this year is the 85th anniversary for Marvel Comics, so we also have a list of products to sell at this event," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cosplayers dressed as Iron Man, the Hulk, and Jedi from the Star Wars franchise were also enjoying the atmosphere at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai as they posed for pictures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets are priced at HK$42 for adults and HK$20 for children aged 3 to 11. Visitors are required to purchase their tickets via the organiser’s mobile application or at convenience stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over-the-counter tickets will only be available to international tourists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Preterm births and malnutrition in children have increased in Gaza due to worsening conditions over the past nine months, according to a Hong Kong nurse and midwife who has been on the ground with the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Krystal So, who recently returned from a month in Gaza, said she encountered dire conditions including overwhelming patient numbers, supply shortages and unsafe conditions for pregnant women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can imagine running a hospital, we need a lot of specific medical supplies, for example, what we wear, what we use for medication. The most urgent need is water and fuel," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So said many healthcare centres had been destroyed by airstrikes which led to an overwhelming influx of patients on a daily basis at the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza where she worked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that Gaza's sealed borders prevented essential medical and daily necessities from reaching hospitals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Chinese University said a study pointed to children more likely to have bipolar disorder, if their parents also have the condition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Findings from the study carried out with the help of 10 hospitals in the Greater Bay Area showed that the risk doubled for children with one or both parents having bipolar disorder, compared with others whose parents don't have the condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study also found that the risk of circadian dysfunction is four times higher for teenagers with one or both parents with bipolar disorder, and 7.5 times higher of having symptoms of social anxiety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said this was because these teenagers have significantly lower-than-usual levels of melatonin, which helps with sleep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team said their findings form a roadmap of bipolar disorder symptoms which can help with treatment plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Wing Yun-kwok, who heads the Department of Psychiatry at the university, said people with mental illnesses need to learn to live with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think mental illness or bipolar disorder is just like diabetes, blood hypertension, cancer. There's no difference. When you have too high blood glucose, that's diabetes. Too much blood pressure is blood hypertension. So you have too much swing in moods, actually it's bipolar," Wing said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union on Thursday said it has received requests for help from over 500 workers on more than 10 projects, involving some HK$30 million in unpaid wages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The union called on the Labour Department to establish a working group to settle the disputes as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also warned there could be more disputes over pay in the construction industry as the economy slows and there are fewer private projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union said there is a long-standing problem with contractors not paying on time, which causes delays and cash flow problems for subcontractors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The biggest problem is what leads to the workers' wages being owed, which is subcontractors not receiving payment. There are many reasons behind subcontractors not receiving payment. It could be about the construction progress; or there are some challenging contracts, which defer payment for two months; or even worse to deliberately be picky on their work, then delaying the subcontractors’ fund for business and wages," said the union's chairman Chau Sze-kit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union also urged the Legislative Council to quickly pass the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to protect workers.

    Cross-border cord blood arrives at Children's Hospital

<div class="itemFullText">
 Doctors at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital say a five-year-old girl with severe thalassaemia will undergo stem cell transplant surgery in October using umbilical cord blood transferred from the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The procedure can cure the condition and abolish the need for the patient to have a blood donation every four to five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a media briefing on Thursday, the hospital said the blood came from the girl’s younger brother and was moved to Hong Kong last week from a cell bank in Guangzhou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Cheuk Ka-leung, a consultant at the hospital’s department of paediatrics and adolescent medicine, said checks have been conducted to make sure the blood is a match for the girl and safe to use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have proceeded to type the brother's white blood cells to see whether this brother's white blood cells match with the patient and we found that it really matches,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We initiated a lot of communications. We make sure that the quality and the results of testing of the cord blood match our standard and then we proceed to arrange for all the procedures, all the paperwork to get the permit to transport the cord blood to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk added that the hospital usually searches for cord blood that matches the patient on a local database organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross, but decided to accept a cross-border donation for the first time as sibling donors are always preferred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital said there are currently 10 patients on its waiting list for stem cell surgery.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A dumper truck driver died on Thursday after being pinned between his vehicle and an excavator.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The accident happened at around 9am at a construction site in the Highland Park housing estate in Lai King.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police are investigating the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu Sin-man, a representative of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, said it's believed that the 42-year-old driver was standing behind his vehicle when a moving part of the excavator pushed him down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu stressed the need for machinery to be equipped with sensors that stop operation in emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Sze-kit, chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, noted a recent increase in industrial accidents and urged site managers to make worker safety a priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen a lot of accidents in the past because sites were not well managed and projects were rushed. Safety was ignored because of negligence or deadlines. We urge employers and contractors to always make safety a priority, no matter how urgent the project," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said it is highly concerned about the accident and expressed its deepest sympathy to the man’s family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it had deployed staff to conduct on-site investigations as well as issuing suspension notices to the contractors involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation," the department said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Thursday ruled that Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai has a case to answer in his national security trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He is on trial facing three charges of conspiracy and sedition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defence had sought to dismiss the case, citing insufficient evidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the court rejected the bid by the defence and said Lai has a case to answer on all charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also heard that the defendant plans to testify in the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case has been adjourned until November 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai has pleaded not guilty to colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to publish seditious material.

    Interest rates uncertainty blamed for tender failure

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing Secretary Winnie Ho says uncertainty over interest rates put developers off bidding for a subsidised housing plot in Chai Wan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government on Wednesday rejected the only bid for the site on Cheung Man Road, as the tenderer failed to meet the reserve price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plot is earmarked for at least 700 units under the Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme on Thursday, Ho said uncertainty over rate cuts affected developers' interest in the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Initially everyone thought interest rate cuts might be [made] in the middle of the year, around June. But that didn't happen. Now everyone thinks there will only be signs of a downward trend at the end of the year," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary said there was no concrete timetable for putting the site out to tender again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau Chun-kong from the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors said on the same programme that the Cheung Man Road plot is in an ideal location, being as it is near an MTR station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a slope at the site would lead to additional costs, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said the government could make the plot more appealing to developers if it reduced the amount of facilities they would be required to build there.
