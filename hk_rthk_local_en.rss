<div class="itemFullText">
 A pest which ravages the leaves of trees like the Chinese banyan leaving them bare is increasing being found on Hong Kong Island after spreading from other parts of the territory in the hot weather, an expert warned on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Larvae of the Phauda flammans moth feed on the leaves of ficus trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The insect was a rare sight in the SAR until around 2019 when it appeared in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, according to Ken So, chief executive of The Conservancy Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the number of trees on Hong Kong Island affected by the pest is increasing, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For insects, because the life cycle can be shortened or the reproduction of insects can always be affected by weather conditions, particularly talking about the temperature. Higher temperatures would favour the reproduction or growth of insects. So likely, the problem of Phauda flammans is highly related to hotter weather," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said pesticides can be used to control the insect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once the larvae eat the leaves with pesticides, then it will kill the larvae, so that it stops or terminates the life cycle of the insects," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So added that professionals are also developing a trap specifically for Phauda flammans.

    Top court dismisses appeal over 2019 assembly case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two of the appellants, Margaret Ng (left) and Martin Lee (right), attended the hearing at the Court of Final Appeal. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765839_1_20240812115111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has unanimously dismissed a final attempt by Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers to overturn their convictions for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai, Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-yan, Cyd Ho and Leung Kwok-hung had been found guilty of organising and taking part in the procession on August 18, which followed an approved anti-police demonstration led by the now-disbanded Civil Human Rights Front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While a lower court earlier acquitted them of organising the assembly, it upheld the participation convictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final appeal had centred on the issue of "operational proportionality", a principle set out by two decisions of Britain's Supreme Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appellants argued that the court should conduct proportionality tests when passing a verdict, and that a conviction would be a form of restriction that infringes on the fundamental constitutional rights of the freedoms of assembly and expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But judges at the Court of Final Appeal on Monday rejected the argument that the arrest, prosecution, conviction and sentence must be separately justified as proportionate, saying a separate proportionality inquiry was "inappropriate and uncalled for".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The defendants' convictions and consequent sentences do not stand alone. They are the result of the judge applying the law to the evidence and being satisfied individually of their guilt," the ruling said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The same pertains to the defendants' proposition in respect of arrest and prosecution. Those actions similarly do not occur in isolation. They represent steps taken to enforce particular offence-creating laws."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the presiding judges, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung and Roberto Ribeiro, said the two British legal precedents cited by the appellants "should not be followed in Hong Kong" because of differences between the two jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, statutory and other provisions which are found to be unconstitutional may be struck down as invalid whereas in the UK, a provision that is declared to be incompatible continues to be enforced as a valid law, with potentially different issues regarding proportionality arising thereafter," the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow justice Johnson Lam added that there is no basis in the SAR to consider the prosecution, conviction and sentence as "distinct, standalone restrictions" from the rule creating the offence relating to freedom of assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord David Neuberger of Abbotsbury, a non-permanent judge from Britain, said the constitutional differences in Hong Kong and the UK "do not mandate a different approach when it comes to considering whether a restriction on the freedom of assembly is proportionate", but they "do require a different approach if the court concludes that the restriction is not proportionate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who attended the hearing, said it was not appropriate to comment on the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't had a chance to look at this very important judgment. This is not the right time to make comments. We just want to take this occasion to thank our legal teams and all the people who have been supporting us all the time," she said outside the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, left the court saying he had "no comment".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Space Museum says the Perseid meteor shower will peak before dawn on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual meteor shower has been active since last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Chiu from the museum said around 100 meteors per hour are expected between 11:30pm on Monday and 5am on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said Clear Water Bay will be one of the best locations for seeing them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the weather is suitable for watching, we would suggest people go to the extremely dark and also the wide sky area to watch the meteor shower. And the suggested area that's actually in the kite-flying area, Tai Mei Tuk and Clear Water Bay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu also said the museum will livestream the meteor shower on its YouTube channel, while offering insights into the astronomical aspects of the shooting stars.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday congratulated the SAR's athletes for their achievements at the Paris Olympics, noting it was the first time that Team Hong Kong, China had won more than one gold medal at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Golds from foil fencer Edgar Cheung and épée fencer Vivian Kong, as well as two swimming bronzes from Siobhan Haughey, put the SAR 37th in the medals table, which is the city's highest ever ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Hong Kong athlete has given their utmost and unleashed their full potential in the Olympic arena. In spite of the results, all athletes have fully exhibited their determination, perseverance and will, demonstrating their professional attitude and sportsmanship," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people of Hong Kong and I are deeply inspired and moved. The people of Hong Kong are proud of the high level of performance shown by Hong Kong athletes, and each and every one of them is a hero in our hearts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the government would provide more sporting facilities, such as converting an existing sports centre into a dedicated fencing venue, and speeding up a study on building a fencing arena and a swimming pool which can host international competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the current financial year, the administration had provided more than HK$940 million in funding to the Sports Institute through the Elite Athletes Development Fund, around a 40 percent increase from five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said with the Paris Paralympic Games later this month and Hong Kong co-hosting the National Games next year, he's confident that society would continue to support the SAR's athletes to shine and "demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Hong Kong".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK on Sunday co-hosted a show with the public broadcaster in Indonesia at the Victoria Park, where the audience was treated to performances from local and Indonesian singers and dancers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indonesian singer Nabilla Gomes flew in to perform live at "RTHK Summer POP UP", and she was joined on stage by Hong Kong singer Lagchun, Indonesian-Hong Kong singer-songwriters and dance groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event aimed to foster bond among people from the two places, which is among cooperation priorities of China's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In February, RTHK signed a memorandum of understanding with the Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) to strengthen cooperation, jointly producing a radio programme, "Halo Jakarta! Hello Hong Kong!", in Bahasa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme was broadcast on both stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Director of Broadcasting, Eddie Cheung, noted that Sunday's event was a celebration of Indonesia’s Independence Day, as it allowed the programme to go outdoors for greater interaction with the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The event shows that Hong Kong is an open and inclusive society," he said while giving a speech at the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through joint programmes and events, the two broadcasters show how to put people-to-people bond under the Belt and Road Initiative into practice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, the Indonesian Consul-General, Yul Edison, said the media have a growing importance in today's world in connecting people, combating stereotypes and addressing misinformation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jennifer Valente of the United States on Sunday retained her Olympic title in the women’s omnium at the Paris Games while the SAR's Ceci Lee finished 20th.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That concluded Hong Kong, China's participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente ended with 144 points in the multi-race event, consisting of the scratch, tempo, elimination and points races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland’s Daria Pikulik took silver while Ally Wollaston of New Zealand rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first scratch race, cyclists were ranked and awarded points by the order they finished the 30-lap event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente was off to a strong start and finished first, earning the maximum 40 points, with Canada’s Maggie Coles-Lyster and Georgia Baker of Australia coming from behind to grab second and third respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, making her Olympic debut, came 19th among the 22 riders to earn four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist moved up to 18th overall after the second tempo race, where the top contestant per lap was awarded a point from the fifth lap forward while 20 points were given for lapping an opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland’s Lara Gillespie came out on top in this race but Valente maintained her overall lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old SAR athlete earned 16 points by finishing 13th, giving her 20 points at the end of the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the elimination round, the last cyclist of every other lap was knocked out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente won this round as well to continue to top the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, was the fifth athlete eliminated and ended up with six points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final points race, points were awarded to the top four athletes for every 10 laps in the gruelling 80-lap race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist finished near the bottom of the pack in the race that was won by Poland’s Pikulik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, a tearful Lee described her performance as "very poor", saying she felt she let many people down, including her coaches, teammates and the former top SAR cyclist Sarah Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like in the past, I did very poorly in the scratch race, and I couldn't change that today," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though Sarah Lee very diligently tried to pass on her experience to me before the race, I still did very poorly. Coaches and teammates spent a lot of time training with me for the omnium, but I still raced very poorly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had said she hoped to finish in the top 10 overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee, who won silver at the Asian Games last year, added that her Paris experience allowed her to get a taste of just how good the world's finest cyclists are. She also said she hopes to work hard in future to improve her fitness and use of tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's cycling team head coach, Herve Dagorne, said while he could understand her frustrations, he felt she could have been more aggressive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the ominum, and the last event is the points race. You need to score points, so if you don't try, you don't get it, it will not come from the sky," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can understand it's disappointing... I wish she could have attacked more in the points race, like the Japanese did and the French did. They gained a lap, [scoring] 20 points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation earned a total of four medals in Paris: golds for fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung, and two bronzes from swimming star Siobhan Haughey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee and taekwondo athlete Lo Wai-fung will be the flagbearers for the SAR at the closing ceremony.

 Police on Sunday said they have arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of drug trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they confiscated 34kg of suspected methamphetamine and 1kg of ketamine, with a total street value of HK$18.5 million, in a Cheung Sha Wan flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police discovered that this drug-trafficking syndicate was renting an upscale private residential flat as a warehouse and a distribution centre for drugs. They took advantage of the low foot traffic and heavy security in an attempt to evade law enforcement," inspector Chang Yuen-lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police urge property owners to check the backgrounds of potential tenants such as occupation, income verification and the intended use of the rented unit before renting them out, so as to prevent their properties from being misused by criminals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect is set to appear in court on Monday.

    HKers putting rope skipping on the map in Paris

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Olympic delegation isn’t the only team representing the SAR in Paris – the city’s rope skipping performance squad is also in the French capital to push for their sport to be included in future editions of the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rope skipping troupe is amping up the atmosphere at the Paris Games by performing at the Place de la Concorde, which has become the heart of urban sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time in history, various urban disciplines, such as 3x3 basketball, street and park skateboarding, BMX freestyle and breaking, have been grouped together at one site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though these sports have increasingly been adopted in the past two Games, there are those, like rope skipping, that still have not made their way to the Olympic stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's what the Hong Kong Rope Skipping Association, China, is hoping to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform at the open stage of Parc Urbain to promote urban culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tina Wong, the association's chairperson, said performing in Paris is an opportunity they could not pass up, even though the Games conflicted with the jump rope Asian Championships in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are here on the Olympic platform. We actually have the goal or you could say dream to have jump rope skipping to be included in the Olympics in 2032 in Australia because Australia is one the strongest countries in this sport. This is a more long-term goal. On a short-term basis, we are aiming for Asia,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually last year, the Olympic Council of Asia has already granted rope skipping the provisional membership, so meaning we are already included in Asia. This year, we are here. Next year, we are aiming to go to the Youth Asian Games and pave the way for the Asian Games and then the Olympics. We hope with more support, we can officially be on the Olympic stage soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four athletes from the SAR have made their way to Paris to perform, including 18-year-old Yuen Hiu-tung, who said that the atmosphere was unbelievable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s like a dream to come here because even though we paid to come here, it’s a very valuable experience for us because we don’t know when jump rope can get into [the] Olympics, so it is a good experience to promote jump rope, and also letting everyone know how is jump rope [works] and how everyone is enjoying this sport,” she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The honorary secretary general of Hong Kong's top sports body, Edgar Yang, on Sunday said the city should nurture all athletes with potential, rather than solely focusing on one or two elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to a TV programme, the senior member of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China said the SAR has huge potential for sports development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the system must be very sound, and this sound method starts from popularising and definitely not focusing on just one or two athletes - but rather on the overall system that can bring out potential. We must put in a great effort. Even for those who have not yet fully realised their potential, we must enable them to be inspired," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Paris Olympics nears its end, Yang said Hong Kong athletes are now world class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR athletes have secured two gold medals in fencing and two bronze medals in swimming.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765722_1_20240811124413.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog on Sunday that Hong Kong should integrate further with China's national development and contribute to modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan said that the Third Plenary Session held in Beijing last month passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform and Promoting Chinese-style Modernization," which outlines Hong Kong's strategic positioning in leveraging the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, enhances the city's status as an international hub, and supports Hong Kong's bid in gathering top international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an international financial centre, Chan said that Hong Kong should fulfil its role as an offshore RMB business hub, focusing on shipping centre development, smart shipping, and green shipping, to make Hong Kong a "cross-border supply chain management centre" that provides one-stop support for mainland enterprises in expanding their production capacity and supply chain layout overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said this will generate new trade service demands and attract greater opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the SAR government is also recruiting talent and has launched a series of initiatives like the Top Talent Pass Scheme that supports talent development, to attract more top international talent to the region.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong on Sunday kicked off her visit to Hangzhou with a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme - a mentorship scheme aimed at helping underprivileged Hong Kong teenagers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During the five-day trip, Kong, along with the delegation, will visit technology companies and athlete training centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of her departure, Kong said she wanted to give something back to Hong Kong, as she started her new job as an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as an athlete, I worked really hard to train and to make Hong Kong people proud, to win results and to unite everyone so that we can all enjoy sports. And now that I'm lucky enough to join the Jockey Club, I wish I could use my platform and use the power of sports to unite everyone and hopefully just make sure that we all love sports and be happier," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said dozens of underprivileged pupils were joining the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eighty-four pupils and five mentors will take part in the five-day tour. The itinerary is diverse, ranging from innovation and technology, history, culture, to sports. We expect that senior officials from the SAR will also join this tour," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong announced her retirement from full-time fencing last week, after she won the women's individual epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded more than 45,300 crimes during the first half of the year, a 5.6 percent increase from the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deception made up about 40 percent of all cases. Victims – who were mostly scammed online – were swindled out of HK$4.48 billion in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the number of "Guess Who" phone scams were down by 61 percent, the force pointed out that fraudsters had adopted new tactics such as impersonating staff of e-shopping and online payment platforms, and telecommunications companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force also revealed that its robbery detection rate of 84.1 percent was the highest since it started maintaining statistics for the period in 1977, with police stepping up anti-burglary patrols, especially in areas with village houses. Officers noted they used drones and partnered with the Government Flying Service to carry out air patrols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of June 30 this year, 300 arrests have been made under the National Security Law that was put in place four years ago, it added. About 60 percent of those arrested have been charged.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Over 1,000 policymakers, researchers and young entrepreneurs gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre on Saturday for the city's first youth development summit, organised by the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee said young people should learn from the Olympic spirit and be inspired by Hong Kong's young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we can't all be Olympic champions, we can all be champions of our own stories. We can all live in the spirit of the Olympic motto, faster, higher, stronger, together, in our pursuit," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong also attended the summit, where she showed her medal from the Paris Games to audience members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, who won gold in the women's individual epee, said she was initially very nervous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time I was nervous, I would turn and channel all that energy into training. So the more nervous I got, the more training I did, and that gave me the confidence to be like: okay, I am doing everything I can to fence the best that I can at the Olympics and I shouldn't be scared, I shouldn't be worried about the results", the 30-year-old fencer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said that the government's youth development blueprint could provide all-round support to its targeted beneficiaries of those aged between 12 and 39.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blueprint was rolled out in December 2022, with around 60 additional measures added last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them includes the Member Self-recommendation Scheme for youth. The government is working to triple the number of participating advisory committees to not less than 180 in the current term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To date, 85 government advisory committees have joined the scheme, covering trade and industry, innovation and technology, human resources planning, child affairs, and much more," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that the energy, creativity, and resilience of young people will help create a better future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong paediatrician on Saturday said the SAR has seen a large rise in scarlet fever cases this year, and he advised early treatment with antibiotics to prevent complications. The disease, which is caused by streptococcal infection, usually affects children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Mike Kwan, from the university's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, said symptoms include high fever and a red body rash that leaves an in-print if touched. Speaking on a radio programme, he gave more details about the rise in case numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, for example last year, the notification rate in fact is less than 10 every month. But in Hong Kong this year, the notification rate, up until last month was around 260 in June. So the number is really high, and this indicated the streptococcal strep A activity is really high among our population," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lau Yu-lung, chairman of the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases, said there had been 4,500 Covid cases in Hong Kong last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the 31st week of this year - between July 28 and August 3 - sewage surveillance showed that infections seemed to have reached their peak. But it's too early to say whether there has been any decline," he said, while appearing on the same radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lau said there had been seven outbreaks in care homes last week involving 60 patients, and the situation is worrying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Covid jab could significantly lower the mortality rate, and he urged vulnerable people, such as those suffering from chronic illnesses, as well as people in care homes to get a booster.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Saturday said businesses should be more open to employing athletes once they retire, as they have already shown their abilities on a global stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Yeung said the government had allocated resources to help athletes once they step down. He said most have skills that are highly sought by employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually we hope the business sector will consider employing more athletes because we think they have a lot of abilities: such as how they face challenges, how they remain calm under pressure, and their perseverance. These are qualities we hope society will be able to see, and we hope the business sector will be able to give athletes more chances," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said universities here have been admitting athletes through their top athletes admission scheme and granting them a longer study period so they can attend training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the promotion of sport in the community is crucial if new talent is to be discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government is trying to promote different kinds of sport in the community.... When more people are involved in sport, more people will develop an interest in sport, and it will be easier for us to find talent and give them the resources to train their skills," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are also supporting the Hong Kong Sports Institute and The Jockey Club to do research into how to increase athletic performances and make use of human science to improve training," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yeung said the Paris Games had encouraged people to go out in the evening and watch Olympic events, which are free-to-air. He said the catering industry had recorded around a 30 percent increase in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked whether the government would continue to purchase the Olympic Games broadcasting rights in future, Yeung said the government would consider sporting events on a case-by-case basis.

    HK's pioneering Olympic judges pave the way forward

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The road to the Olympics is not easy for athletes, but it’s just as hard for judges who likely spend the same amount of time and effort in training to be able to officiate Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For gymnastics judge Yuen Ka-keung, the journey to Paris was lonely and arduous, but one that he hopes will pave the way for others to follow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Being an Olympic gymnastics judge is not easy because you have to pass many of the selection [tests] under the International Federation, so you had to prepare a lot, meaning that you had to spend a lot of the time and also you had to manage everything well,” Yuen, who is judging the Olympics for the third time in Paris, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to allocate my time and also allocate, for example, money to make the proper preparation for this Olympic Games. Another thing is that if you prepare for the Olympic Games very seriously, you will feel alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen is the only gymnastics judge from the SAR. To qualify, he had to judge designated events within the Olympics cycle and obtain the best evaluation result in two competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The veteran gymnast said he hopes the government will put more resources into training athletes, and those behind the scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gymnastics is not only [about the] coach and gymnast. We should have many more supporting people, for example the judge, the physiotherapist, the psychologist and other people,” Yuen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Wong, one of the two cycling judges from Hong Kong appointed by the International Federation, echoed Yuen’s views.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Hong Kong, we can organise different kinds or different levels of judge development or training courses and encourage the people to have the qualification to enter the international training courses," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like me, when I prepared for the international commissaire course, I paid [for it] myself,  [so I could] visit different kinds of large-scale events."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, who played a leading role on the judging team for cycling at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said he feels proud to be a part of the world's biggest sporting event for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that safety is paramount on the racetrack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We stand on the track to monitor the behaviour of the riders and also the behaviour of different TV broadcast staff members. Because we need to protect all the people on the track,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In case any accident happens, the riders will go out of the track with the bike and at that moment [there will be] a serious accident if we don't manage it in a proper way.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that he hopes newcomers can have more exposure to large-scale cycling events in Asia before they become judges.

 SAR cyclist Ceci Lee and taekwondo athlete Lo Wai-fung have been named as the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China team at the Olympic closing ceremony on August 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ceremony will take place at the Stade de France, which hosted athletics and rugby sevens during the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, a Olympic debutant, will compete in the women’s omnium on the same day.

    Ocean Park unveils study on late male panda An An

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Researchers have studied the last two years of male giant panda An An by tracking his activities. Photo courtesy of Ocean Park" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765534_1_20240809202111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A study on one of the Hong Kong's beloved giant pandas could shed light on life-long care for the animals, according to researchers who had monitored the late An An.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ocean Park on Friday said it had conducted a study on the world's oldest zoo-housed male giant panda, covering the final two years of his life and tracking his activities, movement patterns, and habitat preferences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Results showed that An An, who lived 35 years or roughly 105 human years, conserved energy by favouring gentle slopes when going uphill and steeper paths when descending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said this behaviour – which led the animal to cover greater distances uphill than downhill – mirrored that of wild giant pandas, researchers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park's senior research fellow, Eszter Matrai, said the study will help improve future enclosure designs for ageing pandas and can also be considered for other animals at zoos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This provides an objective measure of lifestyle changes based on life stages in terms of age and illnesses. The results can be used for habitat optimisation and sustainable improvement for life-long care,” Matrai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the study contributed to the limited literature on the behaviour of geriatric animals, because previous studies on ageing pandas had primarily focused on veterinary medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These findings go beyond design enhancements, guiding tailored care plans and enrichment activities based on age-related behavioural changes and seasonal variations," Matrai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An An was one of two giant pandas gifted by the central government to Hong Kong in 1999. He died in July 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR is sending 23 athletes to Paris for the upcoming Paralympic Games, with prize rewards nearly doubled to reward Paralympians.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The athletes representing Hong Kong, China, are set to compete in eight sports. The squad includes wheelchair fencer Alison Yu, who will be competing at the Paralympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu, who has won seven Paralympic gold medals, three silvers and one bronze, said it is important to get into the right mindset in the last weeks leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so looking forward to competing at the Grand Palais... In the Olympic Games, we saw Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong get gold medals at the Grand Palais, so I think the Grand Palais is a lucky place for us," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to relax a bit from fencing, not thinking so much about fencing and trying to be ready mentally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For rider Natasha Tse, she said it is an honour to compete for the SAR in her fourth Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My challenges in this Games are on how to get used to my new horse, or how to get used to the weather, or even the accuracy in my test," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Paralympian Leung Chung-yan, who will compete in the men's table tennis singles, said he is excited to play and hopes to win a match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officiating at the flag ceremony ahead of the Games, Chief Executive John Lee pointed to higher rewards for Paralympians, with a gold medal winning solo athlete set to receive HK$1.5 million. He also said the entire city is behind the SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of you have overcome various challenges to reach the pinnacle of sport, competing with athletes from all over the world on the Paralympic stage. We are proud of you," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Your participation not only represents your personal efforts and achievements but also represent Hong Kong's support and recognition of parasports."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Paralympics will run from August 28 to September 8.

    DAB urges government to tackle rat problem in Wan Chai

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Many Wan Chai shopkeepers and residents surveyed by the DAB said they encountered rodents on the streets. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765505_1_20240809165148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday raised concerns about a rodent problem in the back alleys of Wan Chai and called for government intervention to tackle it.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department shows that Wan Chai is the most infested of Hong Kong's 18 districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent DAB survey of over 800 shopkeepers and residents in the area, more than 70 percent said they had encountered rodents on the streets between May and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jennifer Chow, chairwoman of the party's Wan Chai branch, said the three main hotspots identified in the district were Bowrington Road Market, Yat Sin Street and Wing Hing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some residents saw rats climbing up the pipes into their homes and they were very frightened. We have to do more in terms of cleaning the environment to prevent the rats from going down the street," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hotspots are mostly the back lanes of the private property that is not the government area. So that's the most difficult thing that they face because they don't have any support from the government to clean or to prevent most of the rubbish in their back lane."

 We've heard a lot over the past two weeks about athletes battling it out for the gold medal at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  What about ordinary people like you and I?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While our gold medal moments may not involve winning a place on the podium, we've all experienced things in life that made us incredibly happy or proud.
  <br/>

  RTHK spoke to people in Paris and Hong Kong, and asked them what they felt were their proudest or most joyous moments.

    Discovery Bay ferry fares to rise from Sunday

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People travelling on the Discovery Bay ferry to and from Central will pay up to 21 percent more per trip from August 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Adult residents using Octopus Cards registered with the ferry operator will see the fare for the 25-minute journey go up from HK$33.5 to HK$38.2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fares will increase to HK$24 for those aged 65 or above, and to HK$19.1 for full-time students under 26, as well as children under 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices for those without registered cards will go up from HK$46 to HK$55.8, with the discounted rate for seniors and children rising from HK$23 to HK$27.9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase approved by the government is lower than the 60 percent the ferry operator, Discovery Bay Transportation Services, had requested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to Islands District Council, the Transport Department noted that the fares were last raised in June 2018. It said the number of passengers had dropped, while operating costs continued to rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The revenue generated by the ferry service has been insufficient to cover the rising operating costs. In addition, the cumulative inflation rate has reached double digits since the last fare adjustment," the department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In granting the fare hike, the authorities said they had taken in account a number of factors, such as operating costs, revenues and the level of public acceptance of the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department also said the ferry operator should continue to "explore feasible measures" to improve its financial situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) on Friday unveiled plans for a HK$1 billion redevelopment project in To Kwa Wan that will affect around 180 households and 20 shops.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blocks with even numbers between 324 and 354 Ma Tau Wai Road will be demolished. The buildings are three to nine storeys high and were constructed between 55 and 69 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA said the blocks, containing many subdivided flats, have been poorly maintained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New buildings up to 120 metres in height will be built, offering around 230 residential units, with the blocks linked to nearby open space and an underground shopping street leading to To Kwa Wan MTR Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michelle Tong, the URA’s general manager for acquisition and clearance, outlined the compensation available for the flat and shop owners and residents affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will offer acquisition consideration to the owners and the value will be based on the market value at the time when we issue the acquisition offer. We will ask surveyors appointed through ballot to assess the market value and the home purchase allowance value at the time before the offer was issued,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the tenants, we will check their eligibility and if they fulfil the eligibility then we will offer the ex-gratia allowance or the rehousing arrangement.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A freezing survey will commence on Friday, followed by a public consultation exercise from September 25 to October 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA said it expects the project to be completed by 2033 or 2034, assuming no appeals are filed against it.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Johnny Ng says Hong Kong's virtual banks still probably need a couple more years to turn a profit, if similar banks in the UK and Germany are an indicator, although the trend is in their favour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Virtual banks have been operating here since 2020 and a recent report released by the Monetary Authority shows the SAR's eight virtual banks are still in the red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 2.2 million people use these banks, but their deposits account for only 0.3 percent of total savings among all Hong Kong banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Ng says they are gaining ground, especially among the young, as they can offer attractive 1-year fixed rate deposits and other offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people are often unaware that they have the same deposit protection as traditional banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, the protection is the same for HK$500,000 deposit in the bank which is protected by insurance of all banks, including traditional banks and also the virtual banks," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So you can see the trend... people moving, especially young people, moving from the traditional bank to use the virtual banks. Also they provide a lot of attractions and promotion offers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng also said that, unlike traditional banks, virtual banks don't require a minimum deposit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's virtual banks are ZA Bank, WeLab Bank, Mox Bank, Ant Bank, Livi Bank, Ping An One Connect Bank, Airstar Bank, and Fusion Bank.

    HK's Lo Wai-fung misses out in Taekwondo repechage

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China’s Lo Wai-fung wasn’t able to make a comeback in the men’s Taekwondo 68kg category, losing to national team athlete Liang Yushuai in the repechage at the Paris Olympic Games early on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two came in strong in the first round, but after a close battle, Liang came out on top in a close 5-4 contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unfortunately, Lo wasn’t able to take back control in the decisive second round, with Liang winning 13-0, care of two body kicks, a head kick and a five-point turning kick, bringing the SAR athlete’s Olympic debut to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said he was both nervous and excited in his bouts: nervous because it was such a big, raucous crowd at the Grand Palais, and excited because he wanted to enjoy the stage at his Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the first round [against Liang], I think I fought according to the coaches' plans," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But when it's the second round, perhaps my opponent disrupted my rhythm, and I got a bit anxious towards the end, so that allowed him to have a turning kick to the back of my head to extend his lead."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added he hopes he can inspire more taekwando fighters from the SAR to make it to the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo was previously defeated by reigning Olympic champion Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. Since the Uzbek athlete went on to make it to the final, Lo was granted entry to the repechage competition for a chance at bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, this is the first time a Hong Kong athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liang took bronze for China after his British opponent withdrew.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare secretary Chris Sun on Thursday said the elderly can showcase their talents through performing arts, as Hong Kong prepares to host its first festival to celebrate elderly artists.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came as more than 100 performers aged up to 86 are set to take the stage at the "First Hong Kong Creative Ageing Arts Festival" next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also noted that Hong Kong's population is ageing, and urged all sectors to join hands and create an elderly-friendly culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 20 years time, every one in three people in Hong Kong will be aged 65 or above. We need to encourage more elderly to actively participate in society," Sun told an event to promote the festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope our creative ageing artists can showcase their abilities and skills to the community," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event will feature more than 30 programmes including dance performances and art exhibitions starting from September 25 to October 6 at the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 75 prisoners have graduated from the Correctional Services Department's Ethics College, receiving diplomas in education.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Among the graduates was Tong Ying-kit, the first person charged under the National Security Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the graduation ceremony on Thursday, Tong reflected on his past, saying that he had been influenced by radical comments, misinformation and the social atmosphere at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was grateful for the education opportunities given to him, and expressed his desire to make positive contributions to society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang, who attended the ceremony, congratulated the graduates and said he was proud of their achievements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised the role of the college in guiding them towards a more constructive path in life and instilling in them the importance of upholding ethical values.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the event, Tang praised the achievements of Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong and expressed regret that some people targeted and criticised her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kong is supportive of the government and she condemns violence. I think the stance should be encouraged, and everyone should embrace that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong won gold in the individual epee event at the Paris Olympic Games and is joining the Hong Kong Jockey Club as an assistant external affairs manager.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group on Thursday said the sale of illegal cigarettes is becoming a more serious problem in Hong Kong, with free trial packets even handed out in the streets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group warned that such cigarettes could be harmful to health, because it's not clear what ingredients they contain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui Yuen, a member of the group, said he now sees promotional teams handing out free trial packets of illegal cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I run into them once or twice in Kwun Tong every week, there are no regulations! Where is the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Convener of the group Joe Lo said these promotional squads also encourage people to keep in contact with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Smokers are also invited to join the Telegram group to receive more promotional advertisements and to keep in contact," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also warned against a plan by the government to ban fruit-flavoured cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said a recent survey it carried out involving 297 people who smoked fruit-flavoured cigarettes found that two thirds would try to find illicit products if a ban came into effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Lo Wai-fung is heading into the round of 16 in the men’s Taekwondo -68kg category at the Paris Olympic Games, after beating Yahya Al Ghotany of the Refugee Olympic Team in straight sets at the Grand Palais on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo began the first round of the qualification contest with a clean 14-0 sweep, earning nine points in the first minute for three head kicks. He then got two points for a body kick, followed by a three-point head kick to end round one with less than 20 seconds to spare. A round ends automatically if one contestant is ahead by 12 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al Ghotany fought back with a two-point kick to the body at the start of the second round, but Lo came back strong, leading to an intense exchange of blows in the first 30 seconds. The SAR athlete was able to continue with strong kicks to the head to once again pull away by 12 points, and won 16-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo will face Uzbekistan’s Ulugbek Rashitov next for a place in the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time a Hong Kong, China athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.

 Customs officers on Thursday said they had foiled an attempt to smuggle 12 kilogrammes of gold, estimated to be worth HK$7.5 million, from Hong Kong to Japan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said an X-ray scan at the airport revealed gold hidden in parts of ozone generators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they suspect smugglers were trying to evade taxes of HK$800,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the third haul of smuggled gold to be intercepted by the authorities this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Society for Community Organization (SoCo) on Thursday called on the government to improve support for caregivers after a mother and son were found dead in their Kwun Tong flat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It's understood that the 60-year-old man died from an accident in the flat, while the 82-year-old bedridden woman died from a lack of care.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Yuen, a community organiser with Soco, said there is a lack of effort to identify high-risk families and inadequate emergency and temporary care support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said many carers do not know where to access support services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen stressed the need for proactive measures to support carers, noting that some older people with chronic illnesses are themselves forced to care for those even more vulnerable than themselves.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lo Wai-fung will be competing in the qualification contest on Thursday at 3pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Being the first to do something is never easy, especially when you have the weight of an entire city on your shoulders, and Lo Wai-fung is going to do just that on Thursday with his Olympic Taekwondo debut at the age of 21.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo will be competing in the men’s under 68kg qualification contest at the Paris Olympics. This is the first time a Hong Kong, China athlete has qualified for the event since Taekwondo became an Olympic sport back in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am the first one. I am going into competition with the weight of over 100,000 Taekwondo enthusiasts in Hong Kong, so it's a mission. They all support me, whether they watch the competition on television or live. Their support is my motivation so I am very thankful for them,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since obtaining his spot at the Paris Games in May, the Taekwondo athlete has undergone training at camps overseas. Lo also watched the first day of Taekwondo action on Wednesday to observe the referees in preparation for his own match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When I first stepped into the competition venue, I was very excited but also nervous. I'm excited because I get to compete in the world’s largest sporting event. I'm also nervous because I’ve never competed in such a large-scale competition before,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There's a lot of pressure with so many spectators watching me, but I will turn that into my motivation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo will first take on Yahya Al Ghotany of the Refugee Olympic Team in a qualification contest at 3pm Hong Kong time on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’ve never competed against the Refugee Olympic Team representative before, but I’ve watched him fight in YouTube videos, and he is always prepared in how he combats and what technique to use when he competes. I’ve only ever watched him in videos, so I won’t know his actual speed and strength until I go up against him. I won’t underestimate him,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Lo beats Al Ghotany, he will once again face world number six Ulugbek Rashitov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. The Uzbek beat Lo at the same stage at the Hangzhou Asian Games, where he ended up taking gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew this opponent was famous at the time, so I didn’t think too much and just focused on combat. You need to give it your all when you step on the stage. Though I lost in the end, I did reflect on the competition,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I asked myself if the gap with this opponent was really that big. If I work harder, I wonder if I can lessen the gap now in competition, and even win.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Grand Palais has been transformed to host the Taekwondo events, after the historic venue hosted fencing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About 40 percent of students taking part in this year's Joint University Programmes Admissions System (Jupas) on Wednesday received offers from local universities, a figure that's in line with previous years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 40,000 students joined the centralised admissions scheme, and more than 15,700 of them were given an offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Hong Kong said it admitted four of the 10 top scorers in this year's Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam, as well as eight top athletes through the Top Athletes Direct Admission Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them is Chloe Pak, who holds the Hong Kong U18 and U20 records in 100m hurdles as well as the Hong Kong record in 4x200m relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pak will be studying medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People think that studying and training may not co-exist, but I definitely do not think this is an issue, because it really depends on the person and their attitude," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese University, meanwhile, admitted five top DSE scorers who will all be studying medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another top DSE scorer will pursue a degree in business at the University of Science and Technology.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765169_1_20240807163355.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge on Wednesday dismissed a carer's claim that a negative culture at the residential home she worked at led to her abusing at least 22 of the children there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu Wing-sin, 46, was one of 34 caregivers charged in connection with a spate of child abuse at the Children's Residential Home in Prince Edward three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pleaded guilty to 49 counts of abuse, with the District Court told she hit children with a shoe and kicked them in the head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as citing a negative culture at the home run by the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children, the defence said Chiu had been praised by parents and senior colleagues during her more than 20 years of experience in childcare and had suffered depression and suicidal thoughts following the abuse incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, judge Lily Wong rejected the mitigation plea and severely criticised Chiu for her actions, saying she "beat up the children every day she went to work".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge questioned why Chiu did not take action or resign from her position if she disagreed with the practices at the centre, instead of participating in the abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was adjourned until September 20 for sentencing.

 Dozens of people queued up on Wednesday to visit Hong Kong's new National Security Exhibition Gallery before it opened at 10am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Located on the second floor of the Hong Kong Museum of History, the gallery is the city's first thematic exhibition dedicated to promoting national security education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman at the front of the queue said that as a Chinese person, she should know more about national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She expressed concern about the limited sense of national identity among Hong Kong's youth compared with their mainland counterparts, and stressed the need for more education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A child accompanied by his grandmother said he wanted to explore issues beyond what he had learned at school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to learn more about Chinese history and law, which we did not learn much about in school," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1,100-square-metre gallery is divided into six different zones, including a theatre that shows a short video about modern Chinese history and emphasises the importance of national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has called for a wide range of visitors to the gallery.

    Cathay declares interim dividend despite profit drop

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765141_1_20240807130622.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Wednesday announced an interim dividend due to its strong performance in the first six months of 2024, despite reporting a drop in first-half profit from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm added that a decrease in profit for its airlines and subsidiaries was "principally attributable to the normalisation of ticket prices".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group recorded a 14 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our strong performance for the first six months of the year was primarily driven by the ongoing robust demand for travel, and the solid performance of our cargo business," said the airline's chairman Patrick Healy in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This result has allowed us to announce a first interim dividend payment to ordinary shareholders of HK$0.20 per ordinary share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay's budget arm, HK Express, reported a loss of HK$73 million in the first half of the year, following earnings of HK$333 million in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Lam said the low-cost carrier had been facing engine issues and regional competition, but he remained confident in the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of those aircraft are on ground and not being able to generate revenue for HK Express in the short term," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second issue HK Express is facing short-term, is the very keen competition among short-haul carriers based in Hong Kong, as well as the foreign low-cost carriers flying into Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Healy said the company is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic flight levels within the first quarter of 2025 as it enters "the final stretch" of its rebuilding journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are increasing our group headcount by 5,000 to a total of 29,000 people by the end of this year to support this pace of growth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline had also bought back HK$19.5 billion in preference shares acquired by the government as part of a bailout package to stay afloat, and said it would continue to maintain a lower level of liquidity than it did during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of its fleet, Cathay said it would buy 30 Airbus A330-900 wide-body aircraft, with an option to purchase 30 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not disclose the purchase price but said it received "significant price concessions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The basic price is about US$11 billion, or roughly HK$85.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These new regional wide-body aircraft are expected to be delivered from 2028 and will join the Cathay Pacific fleet, principally serving destinations in Asia. We now have more than 100 new-generation aircraft in our delivery pipeline, with the rights to acquire 80 additional aircraft in future," Healy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The purchase of Airbus aircraft is part of an investment drive of more than HK$100 billion over the next seven years, which also includes newly designed lounges and cabin products.

    Govt urged to prevent misuse of healthcare vouchers

Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765112_1_20240807113008.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Wednesday urged the government to ensure proper use of public funds as the city's healthcare voucher scheme for the elderly is further expanded to include more mainland medical institutions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong residents aged 65 and above receive HK$2,000 vouchers each year to spend on private healthcare services. From next Wednesday, these vouchers will be accepted at seven facilities in the Greater Bay Area, up from four at present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca Chan, chairwoman of Legco's health services panel, said during an RTHK programme that the government should act as a gatekeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There shouldn't be any possibility of reselling the vouchers or using them for other purposes, such as just buying [medical] products.... The government needs to act as a gatekeeper, perhaps through inspections. They should also look at how to deal with reports of illegal use," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Siu, who manages a mainland service provider covered by the voucher scheme, highlighted the growing trend of Hong Kong residents, especially the elderly, seeking medical services across the border. About one in five of his clients are from Hong Kong, a number he expects to increase after the scheme is further expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes the expansion could help ease the strain on Hong Kong's medical system, adding that his firm plans to hire more Cantonese-speaking staff to meet the growing demand.

    Rower thanks family support for strong finish in Paris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rower Chiu Hin-chun, a two-time SAR Olympian who made history with his performance at the Paris Games, said he wants to thank his family for supporting his career over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu was ranked 20th overall in Paris, the best result for himself and a male Hong Kong rower at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished fourth in his heat in the preliminary round at the Paris Games, and had to go through the repechage to advance to the next stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the heat, I keep asking myself if anything I can squeeze more to not get caught by the Hungarian athlete. And after that, I told myself I already gave my 100 percent in the heat so there's no regrets,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking on five Olympic races in just a week, Chiu said the biggest challenge was to recover both mentally and physically in a short period of time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have to think [about] how to recover, what else I have to eat so I can recover faster. In the middle of the race, I feel very tired and [have] to adjust my [mentality] to prepare for the next race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a lightweight rower competing in the open category, he admitted it’s not easy to take on Europeans who are larger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with a bright smile, the 29-year-old said family support kept him going until now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially like this time, they come to Paris and they have to walk through like the 2km courses from the start to the finish to the spectator stage to watch my race, and then go back to the start again, and to take the bus and go back to the hotel,” he said.

  <br/>
  “Normally people have their family trip [elsewhere], and our family trip is watching my race. So it is really special for us,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Formerly a windsurfer, Chiu found his place on the flat water because of the satisfaction it brought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In rowing, we have a quote, it’s ‘mileage makes champions’. So when I changed to rowing, I [was] very satisfied with my performance and also the achievements can keep pushing me to the other level,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who won a World Cup gold medal in Switzerland just before Paris, will fly to Canada next for the World Rowing Championships from August 18 to 25.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday urged Hongkongers planning to travel to the United Kingdom, or those who are already there, to be careful given the ongoing protests and riots there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber outbound travel alert – the lowest in a three-tier warning system – is currently in effect for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means there are signs of threat and people visiting should "monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation and asked any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or reach out to the Chinese Embassy in the UK.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Tuesday called for improvements to public facilities for breastfeeding.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The body said a survey of 1,000 breastfeeding mothers found 81 percent were unhappy with the facilities available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Complaints included an insufficient number of babycare and lactation rooms, and small sizes and poor hygiene conditions when it comes to some of those that are available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The conditions of these facilities will directly affect whether women choose to breastfeed or express milk in public places, and may even become barriers to breastfeeding," said EOC Executive Director Ferrick Chu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 90 percent of the survey respondents said they thought shopping centres should provide more breastfeeding or expressing facilities, while over 80 percent thought commercial and government premises should improve the hygiene standards of their facilities, the EOC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission said the government should ensure an even distribution of breastfeeding facilities across different areas of the city and provide incentives for premises to establish and maintain high-quality facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Breastfeeding is not just a mother's responsibility, it also affects the growth and development of the next generation. All sectors of society have a duty to create a favourable environment for breastfeeding mothers," said EOC Chairwoman Linda Lam.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Tuesday called on Hong Kong's business sector to make proactive efforts to understand, respond and embrace changes, during a session studying a letter by President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a recent reply letter to Hong Kong entrepreneurs with family ties to Ningbo, Xi urged them to leverage their strengths and contribute to Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, was quoted as saying that society, especially the business sector, should take the president's words as a guide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, who heads Beijing's liaison office in the SAR, noted that the letter was not only an encouragement for the entrepreneurs, but also expressed Xi's high hopes for the entire business community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR should act as the protagonist, actively participating in the torrent of further comprehensively deepening reforms. It should not be a bystander, but be someone who's involved," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong should fully grasp areas that should be maintained and remain unchanged, areas that should be changed, and areas where it should take the lead in making a change."

 Citybus on Tuesday announced an across-the-board pay rise of 3.6 per cent for all employees.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bus company said that while the market environment remains challenging and it's facing strong inflationary pressures, it considers its workforce to be a very valuable asset.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citybus said that despite the difficult operating conditions, it has decided to offer a competitive pay increase to thank its staff for their dedication and to maintain good labour relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm said it made the decision after considering the views of its employees, adding that the pay rise for frontline staff will come into effect from September 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that in addition to 24 weeks of fully paid maternity leave and two weeks of fully paid paternity leave, it will introduce additional days off for staff whose children are getting married.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislator and Chinese medicine professor Chan Wing-kwong on Tuesday welcomed reports that the voluntary health insurance scheme will be extended to cover services at the city's first Chinese medicine hospital, saying it would be a significant step by the government to further recognise traditional Chinese medicine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nine-storey hospital in Tseung Kwan O is due to open next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Chan said both Chinese and Western medicine hospitals should be treated equally by insurance companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a hospital - whether it specialises in Chinese medicine or Western medicine - the cost of services is essentially the same. From hospital beds to nursing care and other essential services, the cost is comparable. Therefore, insurance companies should expand their coverage to include these healthcare services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, who is the general manager of China Taiping Insurance Company, said the industry needs to know more about what kind of medical services the new hospital will provide and how much it will charge before deciding on insurance premiums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By then, we will have more data to consider how to calculate premiums in the future if we want to extend the voluntary health insurance to cover traditional Chinese medicine services at the hospital," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An opening ceremony was held on Tuesday for Hong Kong's new National Security Exhibition Gallery, with Chief Executive John Lee calling for a wide range of visitors to the attraction.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gallery, at the Hong Kong Museum of History, will open to the public on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said he hopes various groups of people will visit, including groups from primary and secondary schools and youth organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised the crucial role of such visits in effectively promoting national security education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE stressed that safeguarding national security is a responsibility of the SAR government. He reiterated the government's commitment to accurately and fully upholding the One Country, Two Systems principle, while safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Safeguarding national security is always a work in progress. There is no completion. Given the ever-changing international situation, it is necessary to maintain a sense of crisis," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event, Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing's liaison office, described the gallery as a place to help citizens better understand national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The opening of the National Security Exhibition Gallery will further consolidate the consensus that security brings prosperity, and cultivate the grounds for safeguarding national security," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR star swimmer Siobhan Haughey has returned to Hong Kong after winning two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters at the airport that she needs to recharge her batteries before returning to training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to take a break first, and then I'll start training afterwards, because my next competition will be the World Cup in mid-October, so a short break just to process everything that happened and enjoy some down time," Haughey said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what she thinks about being the Hong Kong athlete with the most number of Olympic medals, Haughey said she is honoured to represent the city and bring glory to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I enjoyed this Olympics so much and I have done my best in the competition. The process is much more important than the outcome, I have no regrets," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said the atmosphere in Paris was much better than the Covid-era Tokyo 2021 Olympics as there was an audience in the arena this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My parents and fans can watch my competitions inside the venue... and there are people from Hong Kong everywhere. It feels like we are celebrating the Olympics together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The swimmer said she has no exact plans on how to spend her HK$3 million prize money, but wishes to do something to thank her team for supporting her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey also called for more resources to be allocated to swimming, to enable more young people to reach higher levels in the sport.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's table tennis team of Doo Hoi-kem, Lee Ho-ching and Zhu Chengzhu was unable to advance to the next stage of the women's team competition, losing 3-2 to Sweden in the round of 16.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first three matches between the teams went the distance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s Filippa Bergand and Christina Kallberg won the first two games in the first match 11-9, 11-5. The SAR pair of Doo and Lee made a strong comeback and won the next three games 11-9, 11-4 and 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhu Chengzhu took on Sweden’s Linda Bergstrom in the second match. After a tight back and forth, Bergstrom ultimately came out victorious to bring an overall tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo played against Kallberg in the third match and won the first two games 11-5, before losing the next three to the Sweden player 8-11 and 3-11 and 10-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fourth match, Zhu dominated the three games 11-8, 11-4 and 11-6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee lost 5-11, 6-11, and 10-12 in the final and decisive match against Bergstrom, bringing their Olympic journey to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo took responsibility for the loss, saying she let Kallberg back in the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel I share a bigger responsibility for the defeat because I dropped the third match, it's what led to a loss for the team," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, said she felt the team had no regrets because they had done their best.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added she had played Bergstrom before and had a tough time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the first two games against her [this time], it seems I couldn't really find good ways to make a breakthrough," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, when I found a way in the third game, it was too late. My in-game adjustments weren't bold enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR women’s table tennis team took home bronze in the Tokyo Games.

    HK's Nicholas Halliday ends maiden Olympic run

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China sailor Nicholas Halliday has been eliminated from men’s dinghy competition, with two races cancelled on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The last races were scrapped due to a lack of wind in Marseille, meaning Halliday had no chance to make the top 10 to enter the medal race on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR sailor ranked 24th out of 43 participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday was on 136 net points, compared with 99 for Ireland’s Finn Lynch in 10th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday said it was a shame the races got cancelled because he was feeling good to go, but overall he was satisfied with his Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, but it was really exciting," he told RTHK in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I'm satisfied. I mean I gave it my all, I left no stones unturned, so I'm happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday added he's already setting his sights on qualifying for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.

 The MTR Corporation on Monday announced that services between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay will come to a close about two hours earlier than usual on October 26, to allow for track diversion work for the Tung Chung Line Extension.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The last train from Tung Chung will depart at 11.01pm, while the last train from Sunny Bay to Tung Chung will depart at 11.07pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The railway company said it will arrange free shuttle buses between the two stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services on the rest of the line will run as normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The construction of the Tung Chung Line Extension project commenced last year, with plans to add a new Tung Chung East Station between Tung Chung Station and Sunny Bay Station.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A government adviser says most people won't need to get a Covid booster shot again. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764819_1_20240805161830.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government adviser on Covid suggested on Monday that the cost-effectiveness and coverage of Covid booster vaccinations should be assessed in the long term as infections become milder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases currently recommends a booster shot every six months for high-risk groups such as the over-50s and those with underlying health conditions. They can receive the booster free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's chairman, Professor Lau Yu-lung, said there has been a slight increase in Covid cases recently, but this is not a cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From a public health perspective, we really need some kind of a study to assess the cost-effectiveness... it might not be necessary to administer as in the past, the whole scale of approach for a lot of people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Recently, because of the upsurge of all the monitoring indices, as well as you can just learn from your friends and families who got infected, most of them are really very mild... Indeed every successive infection will be milder than the previous infection until you won't even notice it."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says hot weather led to increased electricity demand. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764812_1_20240805153704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday announced a mid-year net profit of HK$5.95 billion, a near 18 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company said Hong Kong’s accelerated economic recovery, along with hotter weather, led to increased electricity demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Australian and Indian business also improved, offsetting the impact of reduced electricity generation at its nuclear power plants on the mainland due to scheduled maintenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP also pointed to various renewable energy projects on the mainland, saying they will be the key drivers for its profit in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s revenue rose to HK$44.09 billion, an almost 2 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.63 per share, matching the first interim dividend of the year and unchanged from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have always been generating revenue and dividends for the benefit of our shareholders. And we adopt a policy to have a reliable and consistent dividend with steady growth supported by sustainable business development,” said CLP's chief executive officer TK Chiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we will continue to grow the business and if the condition approves, of course, we will try to adjust our dividend. But at the end of the day, the dividend will be approved by the board.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiang also said any further reduction in prices for consumers in the remainder of the year will depend on the international fuel market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because of the continued easing of the energy prices globally, we saw tariff reduction. From January up to August, the tariff for CLP's customers in Hong Kong saw a reduction of about 2 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the remaining part of the year, it will really depend on the international fuel price trend. If the fuel price continues to follow the current trend, there could be an opportunity for further adjustments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about progress in reviewing its power management system following several voltage dips this year, Chiang said the company is working on solutions to minimise the impact such incidents have on customers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested 119 people in a two-week anti-triad operation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they shut down five alleged vice establishments, seven suspected gambling dens, as well as a facility they believe was being used to manufacture illegal drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Inspector Thomas Anthony Lo said the force believes it also busted a syndicate that had scammed people selling luxury goods on social media by making purchases with fake banknotes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group would claim to help the victims inspect and authenticate the items they were selling. At the same time, the alleged scammers would use transparent, plastic bags that contained a pile of cash to district the victims. The victims would also be instructed to go to another room to give their signatures," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During this period, the syndicate would take the opportunity to take away the victims' valuables, leave the scene and never return."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said the victims, who lost HK$2 million between them, later realised that only the banknotes on the top and bottom of the stacks were real and the rest were counterfeit.
