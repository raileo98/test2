<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the governemnt was actively pursuing membership in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a summit organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Lee said the SAR could contribute to the regional economy by becoming a RCEP member.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can offer RCEP member enterprises a wider range of high-quality service options, including supply chain management services, and financial and professional services," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will assist them to better connect and leverage the limitless opportunities brought by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, promoting economic development and innovation in the RCEP member countries and the overall region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the current government administration had been seeking support from RCEP members by making overseas visits to regions such as the Middle East and ASEAN countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong offered a safe and convenient business environment for mainland companies to expand globally, and for foreign companies to enter the mainland market.

    First choice allocations lower in scramble for schools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Education Bureau says 91 percent of primary six pupils got a secondary school place among their top three choices. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760957_1_20240710093545.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Parents choosing a secondary school for their child may have been too optimistic about securing their top choice in this year's secondary school allocation, which was announced on Tuesday. That's according to Rizwan Ullah, who is a secondary school vice-principal and a Kowloon City councillor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Ullah said an overestimation of emigration may have been a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the number this year, one thing that could explain the drop is probably due to parents being a little bit aggressive with their strategy in finding a school for their children, believing the decline in student population will bring benefits to them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said with the children from the mainland talent scheme and with many parents competing for the same spot, this had led to a decrease in the percentage of children getting into their first choice of school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the Education Bureau said 62 percent secured their first choice via central allocation, down from 66 percent last year, and the lowest since 2020. However 91 percent of the around 51,000 primary six pupils did get a place among their top three choices
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with some children in tears about not getting into one of their top three choices of school, Ullah said there were no bad schools and that parents shouldn't put too much pressure on their kids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The children are upset partly because we have created that expectation - if you don't get these three then the child will feel bad. It's just like running in a race, it's the first three. If you're the fourth, you don't get a medal," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But actually, if you look, many students who go to these different schools, they do well in different aspects because we talk about whole-person development and we look at the healthy development of the child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah said it was therefore important not to create too many expectations for children, as the child may have some hidden talent. He said it was just one part of the education process and there were other elements, going forward, like university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ullah also said parents should pick a school, which they believe matches their child's ability, so their child will have a higher chance of getting in.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760907_1_20240709212955.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday held a flag presentation ceremony for the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics ahead of the start of the Games later this month, with Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan announcing higher rewards to further motivate athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I’m glad to learn about the Jockey Club Athlete Incentive Awards Scheme, which will increase the reward for athletes. There will be a 20 percent increase in cash incentives in total compared with the last Olympics. For example, the reward for an individual gold medallist will be raised to HK$6 million. This is a great way to motivate our athletes to strive for better results,” he said at the ceremony at the government headquarters in Tamar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also revealed that due to the rising temperatures in Paris, the administration plans to provide air conditioners for athletes competing there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The order's been placed, the equipment's on its way… I'm going there on July 22nd, and I anticipate that all our rooms [will] have the air conditioning,” said Brian Stevenson, Chef de Mission for the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending a delegation of about 90 people to Paris. Among them are 35 athletes, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Épée fencer Vivian Kong, who narrowly missed out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is now heading to Paris as the world number one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said her mindset has changed since the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the biggest difference between these three years is that Tokyo gave me a lot of time to reflect on why I want to train, why I want to become better, why I want to win, because it doesn't seem to matter if people aren't healthy, if people aren't happy. There are more important things than sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think this time in Paris we can really enjoy sports... Hopefully everyone's healthy again and that it gives more purpose and motivation for me to do well.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For veteran swimmer Camille Cheng, this will be her third Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her family will be in Paris to see her in action in the Games for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think about this time of the season as really the fun part of the season. We've put in the hard work. It's all about the small details, fine-tuning things, focusing on recovery," Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And really, I think more than anything, it's about mentally so that you're in a happy place, that you're surrounded by positive energy... because for me I believe that a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sprinter Felix Diu made the final cut to the Olympics through a wild-card. The 100m specialist and first-time Olympian said his goal is to achieve a personal best at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My expectation for the Olympics is to get a [personal best time] for like 10.3 or 10.2 seconds,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Wai-fung, another Olympic debutant, secured Hong Kong's first-ever Taekwondo Olympic qualification. While excited about that, he said he feels the pressure of representing all the Taekwondo enthusiasts in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes to bring home a medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will be held from July 26 to August 11.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man from Hong Kong has died while climbing Mount Fuji in Japan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to Japanese media, the 58-year-old man was found unconscious while climbing the mountain from Yamanashi prefecture on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was pronounced dead later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said it'd received a request for assistance. It has initiated follow-up actions through the commissioner's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the Chinese embassy in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department added it has provided appropriate advice and assistance to the family members of the victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japanese media quoted local police as saying this was the first death reported since the opening of the 3,776m mountain to hikers this summer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong (ACGHK) organisers on Tuesday said they hope to avoid overcrowding issues at this year's event by charging separately for entry to the cosplay and exhibition areas, rather than issuing all-in-one tickets as they have in the past.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 2,000 cosplayers are expected to join the five-day event from July 26 at the Convention and Exhibition Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ACGHK's chief executive officer, Leung Chung-pun, said more than 140 exhibitors will take part in the fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Apart from Hong Kong citizens being the mainstream, we welcomed visitors from more than 30 countries and regions [last year]... ACGHK has a very stable foundation to continue developing into the most influential anime exhibition in the whole of Asia, or even the world,” Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticket details will be announced at a later date.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security Secretary Chris Tang said on Tuesday that the government has been discussing with Shenzhen officials a plan to speed up immigration clearance procedures at two border crossings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A "collaborative inspection and joint clearance" arrangement at Huanggang Port and Sha Tau Kok will see e-channels and counters of both jurisdictions set up side by side, with travellers only having to have their documents checked once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrangement has been in place on the border between Macau and Zhuhai since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of a review of his bureau's work in the past year, Tang also noted in a social media post that since last week, Hong Kong permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens have been able to apply for five-year travel permits for the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He further noted that in May, mainland authorities expanded a travel scheme for mainland professionals from six industries to visit Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The mainland's central bank on Tuesday announced that global investors will be given more choice of collateral for trading government bonds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will allow offshore investors to use onshore bonds under Northbound Bond Connect as margin collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bonds are limited to those issued by the Ministry of Finance and mainland policy banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the seventh anniversary of the launch of Bond Connect, Jiang Huifen from the PBOC said the new move will reduce the cost for overseas investors to trade mainland bonds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is going to help further expand the application of renminbi bonds as eligible offshore collateral. It will facilitate overseas institutions to hold renminbi bonds, reducing the costs of overseas institutional investors to join Swap Connect. This initiative will be jointly prepared with Hong Kong and will be launched as soon as possible," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's market regulators and the stock exchange operator welcomed the PBOC's new initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said it plans to implement the new measure by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission said they will guide financial infrastructure institutions to take forward the preparatory work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure will provide Northbound Swap Connect investors with the additional choice of non-cash collateral, reducing their liquidity cost and improving capital efficiency. It will also help vitalise offshore investors' onshore bond holdings and further enhance the attractiveness of onshore bonds," an HKMA spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said mainland authorities have chosen two adult giant pandas, aged between five and eight, to be sent to Hong Kong as gifts, hoping the pair will be able to breed in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee said the male panda, which weighs around 120 kilogrammes, is agile and smart, while the 100-kilogramme female panda is gentle and cute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up a three-day visit to Sichuan, the chief executive thanked mainland officials for thoroughly considering the city's requests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had earlier expressed to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration the hope that the two new giant pandas would be able to give birth to the next generation of pandas in Hong Kong, bringing more warmth and joy to Hong Kong. We also hope the giant pandas will be younger adults and physically strong," he told reporters in Chengdu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This pair are now undergoing preparatory work in Dujiangyan, and will be quarantined for 30 days later on. When they arrive in Hong Kong, they will be quarantined for another 30 days. They will then be given time to adapt, before meeting the public."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said Ocean Park will sign a cooperation pact with a mainland giant panda research and breeding facility, and that Hong Kong aims to have the pair arrive by National Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a government statement, the CE highlighted three achievements made during the visit: "the pair of giant pandas to be gifted to Hong Kong have been selected; Ocean Park and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda are working at full steam to draft a co-operation agreement on the details to expedite the approval and implementation of the process; and the establishment of communication channels between Ocean Park, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda to collaborate with and assist one another in facilitating the smooth transfer of the giant pandas to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the culture, sports and tourism minister, said Ocean Park is sending staff members to the province to better understand the giant pandas, while bringing with them bamboo the pair will be consuming in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Ocean Park] will enhance its two facilities for giant pandas, such as adding some plants or climbing frames. We are also considering installing cameras to hopefully share the pandas' activities with the public in real time," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the park will assist with the physical examination of the animals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of performers are gathering in Hong Kong for a six-day event that combines Chinese martial arts and dance to showcase the rich heritage of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Kungfu x Dance Carnival aims to help people develop a deeper appreciation of traditional Chinese culture through a variety of activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video message at the opening ceremony in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive John Lee described the carnival as one of the biggest events in Hong Kong this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the carnival uniquely combines martial arts and dance to showcase the charm of Chinese culture, adding that it serves as a platform to promote cultural exchanges between China and other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Ya, founder of Tangya Arts Tech, which organises the event, said she was delighted to bring together performers from around the world, adding that it was a demonstration of Hong Kong's strength as a centre for cultural and artistic exchange between China and the rest of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are delighted to have attracted 3,000 performers from Hong Kong, the mainland, Macau and more than 10 other countries around the world. They range from four-year-old children to an 82-year-old Tai Chi master from Japan and a 96-year-old Choy Li Fut martial arts master," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Tuesday said authorities must strike a balance between public finances and how much public housing tenants can afford to pay in rent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made the comment after the Housing Authority proposed raising public housing rents by 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved, the increases would take effect in October with a three-month exemption period for most tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some elderly tenants have expressed concerns that they will struggle to afford the increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ho said authorities have to strike a balance between public affordability and financial stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everyone understands that the rent for public housing is much cheaper than in the private market... In public housing, we take care of the living environment, cleanliness, rubbish collection, and maintenance. The rent is low but it helps us maintain financial stability," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister said poor families can apply for rent assistance that cuts their rent by up to 50 percent, adding that the government has been paying the rent for those supported by Comprehensive Social Security Assistance.

    'Regulating ride-hailing services in public interest'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung says the government wants to regulate online ride-hailing services so as to protect people's safety and rights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature on Monday, officials said they plan to give out licences for such services, proposing that the courts could order the seizure of vehicles involved in providing services illegally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said those convicted of providing illegal ride-hailing services could have their driving licence suspended for a period of time, possibly a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, Lam said officials came up with the plans after studying the experiences of other places, such as Shenzhen and Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The biggest effect for us regulating online ride-hailing services is that we hope to be able to protect the safety and rights of passengers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without a regulatory framework, the rights and safety might be affected, or insurance issues. I think these are topics that the general public attaches importance to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam’s bureau said transport officials will study public views and how people's needs are changing, with a view to presenting a legislative proposal next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government has been vetting applications for the formation of taxi fleets, as it plans to give out five licences this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam told RTHK that the government is open to the idea of fleet operators cooperating with mainland service providers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issues are scheduled to be discussed at a Legco panel meeting on Friday.

    'Supply and demand to be a factor in ride-hailing'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Gary Zhang says it is noticeable that the government has referred to supply and demand as it moves to regulate online car-hailing platforms, such as Uber.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to lawmakers on Monday, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said it aimed to present the legislative proposal next year but it would first carry out a study on passenger demand and changing needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Zhang said the government had only previously referred to taxi quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact in the policy paper that the government submitted to the Legislative Council yesterday, the government doesn't really take a very clear stance. But they propose further research," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I noticed that in the process of this further research, the government said it would not only just consider the regulation of ride-hailing platforms but also a review of the supply and demand situation of point-to-point transportation services. Traditionally the government seldom mentions such terms as a supply-and-demand issue in any previous public policy document. The discussion generally focused on the service quality of taxis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang said he believed the issue of quality was more likely a result of supply and demand problems. He said it was positive that the government was willing to focus on clarifying this issue in upcoming research, and that this would make further discussions data driven and more scientific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has proposed regulating online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate. But it is also proposing to increase the deterrent effect by withdrawing a driver's licence for a minimum period of time, such as 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau has said it would work with the Department of Justice and police to finalise details.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport and Logistics Bureau on Monday proposed to regulate online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a document submitted to the Legislative Council, the bureau said it aims to present the legislative proposal next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before making the new rules, the bureau will carry out a study on passenger demand and how their needs are changing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it has already increased penalties for illegal ride-hailing services, but there are limits to enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is proposing to increase the deterrent effect by withdrawing a driver's licence for a minimum period of time, such as 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it would work with the Department of Justice and the police to work out the details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also looked at how other places deal with illegal ride-hailing services, noting that there are already laws regulating online car-hailing platforms in places such as Shenzhen, Singapore, Japan and London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in Shenzhen, for example, people who provide unlicensed ride-hailing services can be fined up to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Uber said it welcomed the government's plan to create a regulatory framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a spokesman for the car-hailing platform said authorities should avoid imposing limits on the number of vehicles that can operate under each platform, warning that this could make ride-hailing services more expensive.

    Time-varying tolls 'likely' for Tai Lam Tunnel

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said the government is inclined to charge lower, time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel when it takes over the tunnel in the New Territories in May next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, private car and taxi drivers pay HK$58, while commercial vehicle drivers pay between HK$64 and HK$79.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, officials have outlined three different pricing scenarios, with the third suggesting different tolls for peak, regular and off-peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Private car drivers would pay HK$45, HK$35 and HK$20 respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taxi drivers would pay HK$30 at all times, while commercial vehicles would be charged HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current administration, Lam said officials had spoken to lawmakers about the way forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said most of them supported the idea of charging time-varying tolls, which has been adopted for the three cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since we have all experienced time-varying tolls with the three tunnels and have seen the results, everyone thought about doing the same with the Tai Lam Tunnel," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So right now, the government is inclined to think that a time-varying toll is also a feasible option for Tai Lam."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said a final decision on tolls would be made by the end of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday launched a two-month public consultation on ways to enhance the Copyright Ordinance, to protect artificial intelligence (AI) technology development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and Intellectual Property Department are seeking views on topics including copyright protection for AI-generated works, copyright infringement liability for AI-generated works, and the possible introduction of specific copyright exceptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The rapid advancement of AI technology, particularly generative AI, has induced revolutionary impacts on diverse domains and industries, as well as a number of copyright issues, arousing worldwide concerns,” a bureau spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The copyright regime is an important part of the intellectual property (IP) regime. On one hand, it protects the economic rights of creators in receiving remuneration from their fruits of creativity, and on the other hand, it properly balances the legitimate interests of copyright owners and the public interest," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National 14th Five-Year Plan set out how Hong Kong should be developed into a regional intellectual property trading centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A large-scale attraction featuring 36 popular animation characters has been installed on the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade, to promote animation development in Hong Kong and support local athletes at the upcoming Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AniCom Sports Park attraction links iconic local characters from different eras to various sporting events, including Old Master Q playing snooker, Dustykid rowing and Joe from the "City of Darkness" performing wushu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alan Wan, vice president of the Hong Kong Comics and Animation Federation, said he hopes the attraction will further promote and develop animation as an art form in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People may not be familiar with our comic or animation characters, but we hope that people will want to take photos with them even if they don't know them. If they want to learn about the character's origin story, we have put QR codes alongside each installation so people can learn about the character and the artist's background," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to bring joy to people who see our installations. We also hope that through these characters, people can learn more about Hong Kong's animations and comics, which in turn brings more attention to the development of comics and animation in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The installations will be in place for the next two years.

  The authority said the increases will range from HK$49 to HK$572 per month, with the average amount at HK$230.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It slated October 1 as the date for the rises, but proposed a three-month exemption period meaning many tenants wouldn't pay any extra before January 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said "well-off tenants" with income or assets exceeding certain thresholds would not be eligible for the exemption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the proposed rises would be affordable for tenants, with about 60 percent of them seeing a monthly increase of HK$250 or less.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For people who truly need help, we already have mechanisms in place to assist them. As for other tenants, we believe that an increase of HK$250 in monthly rents is affordable for them. This decision takes into account various considerations. We need to respect the mechanisms under our housing regulations," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority estimated that the proposed rent increases would generate additional revenue of around HK$2.3 billion per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the three-month waiver will cost the government HK$575 million in this financial year, the revenue increase would help narrow the authority's expected deficit to HK$591 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang said poorer tenants would find the higher rents unaffordable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A majority of the grassroots class are living in public housing, especially the families who are only elderly or live alone. I mean the elderly just received a welfare (payment). So there's definitely no other choice and there's no opportunity to increase the income. For the grassroots class, especially the elderly family, that is not good news," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent.

    Govt says locals get priority for care home jobs

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760723_1_20240708163026.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun on Monday dismissed a claim that the government is "replacing all local care home workers with imported staff".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The allegation came from Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker and executive councillor Stanley Ng, who complained that officials didn't discuss with unions a plan to bring in another 8,000 care home workers in the coming three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past year, 7,000 care workers were brought to Hong Kong under a special scheme for homes that failed to find local staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun told lawmakers that with an ageing population, the demand for care workers will only increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the quota under the import scheme might not be fully used if homes find local staff instead, adding that local workers will always be the main source of manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With reference to actual circumstances, we see or anticipate that there will be a wastage in the sector," Sun said at a Legco welfare services panel meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The age of existing workers is already quite old. If they retire, we cannot meet the service gap because we do not have as many youngsters as we want to join the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials are determined to make sure that local people have priority when it comes to employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a large-scale job fair will be held in September, with many non-governmental organisations operating care homes expected to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that the government will update the Labour Advisory Board about the special import scheme every six months.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University (CUHK) on Monday said it will increase its scholarship funding by almost 90 percent from September, to just under HK$36 million in total.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New students admitted through JUPAS with Level 5** in seven or more subjects will be offered a one-off study allowance and exchange scholarship of HK$410,000, along with a full four-year tuition waiver, the university said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The maximum total value of the scholarship can be over HK$570,000, an increase of over HK$170,000 (approximately 44.6 percent) compared to last year. Adding with scholarships offered by colleges and faculties, the maximum scholarship value will be over HK$1 million."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that students with Level 5** in seven or more subjects who enrol in the six-year medical programme will be offered a full tuition waiver for an additional two years, with the maximum value of the scholarship increasing by around 18 percent to more than HK$660,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of admissions and financial aid Andy Wong said the plan was put in place even before the government recently announced an increase in university tuition fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Economic recovery after the pandemic has not been as ideal as expected. Many families have seen a significant drop in their income, and students are facing pressures of life and study. By significantly enhancing the scholarships, the university hopes that students will be able to focus on their studies without worrying," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university also said the scholarships will switch from annual renewals to one-off allowances, to give students "more flexibility in their arrangements and planning".

    FTU calls on govt to license ride-hailing services

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Monday called on the government to regulate online car-hailing platforms and require their drivers to obtain permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  FTU lawmaker Michael Luk said taxi drivers have struggled to stay afloat in recent years due to competition with illegal cabbies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The taxi industry is facing a severe shortage of drivers, with 10 to 20 percent of taxis idle due to the unlicensed vehicles. Maybe some customers will choose other options," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luk said licensing online ride-hailing services wouldn't hurt the taxi trade and would lead to "fair competition".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't think the ride-hailing services and the traditional taxis are [in conflict]. We think to get rid of the unlicensed vehicles... they can obtain more opportunities to develop the industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the lawmaker said officials can consider subsidising taxi drivers to buy fuel and insurance to minimise the impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, transport officials will brief lawmakers on the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday that he hopes two pandas given to Hong Kong as a present will arrive by National Day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was in Sichuan to discuss the arrangements with mainland officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visiting a panda research centre in Dujiangyan with his wife, the CE saw a number of the animals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of them are super attractive. Male or female, some are strong, some are elegant. It appears they enjoy what they eat. I'm especially happy when I'm here at the centre," Lee told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe when the two giant pandas arrive in Hong Kong, members of the public will be as I am now... they'll feel excited and they'll find the pandas amiable. People will also want to get close to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said officials were still discussing the details regarding sending the pandas to Hong Kong.

    Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760649_1_20240708091647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, said Hong Kong will surpass Switzerland to become the world's largest wealth management hub by 2027.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui said Hong Kong’s appeal in attracting foreign investments has been growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR will continue to improve service quality, noting that the government’s proposals to simplify the process of changing the place of incorporation to Hong Kong will attract overseas companies to establish or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On July 3, the government published new legislative proposals for a regulatory framework that makes it easier for overseas companies to re-domicile in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These proposals include relaxing the requirement for financial statement submission and extending the de-registration period from 60 to 120 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current government term, Hui said Hong Kong's attractiveness to foreign businesses would persist with its low tax rates and relaxed compliance requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In overseas jurisdictions, there have been more requirements for companies to register a place of incorporation. These requirements primarily focus on compliance, such as the need for local economic activities and specific operations. Some companies might enjoy lower compliance requirements or even lower tax rates in these places in the past,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the introduction of a global minimum tax rate and the rising compliance requirements, these incentives are dwindling. So, this has become a driving factor that encourages them to return to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stopped short on predicting the number of companies that would re-domicile to Hong Kong, but stressed a need to establish a suitable platform and framework in advance.

 The Environmental Protection Department says it is investigating a fire on Sunday at a refuse reception centre on Stonecutters Island.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Firefighters had largely put out the blaze by 7 pm, after smoke had been reported in some of the waste about two hours' earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No injuries were reported and all employees were evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre has temporarily suspended its operations and users have been told to use other collection points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it would work with the contractor and the Fire Services Department to investigate the cause of the fire. The department has also told the contractor to submit a report within seven days.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey by the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday highlighted the difficulties faced by tenants living in inadequate accommodation such as subdivided flats, cage homes and rooftop slums during the recent hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Most of the 300 tenants surveyed reported difficulty sleeping and feeling unwell due to the intense heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Observatory, the temperature reached almost 35 degrees Celsius on Sunday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey showed that the indoor temperature in these cramped flats could reach as high as 41 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze Lai-shan, the organisation's deputy director, said the heat had also increased the utility bills of these tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called on the government to subsidise water and electricity bills for these tenants, and to build more public and transitional housing so that they have decent accommodation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday that he would work with the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office to arrange the early arrival of two giant pandas in the SAR during his trip to Sichuan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee announced on July 1 that the central government would send the pandas to the territory as gifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters before his departure, the CE said he would visit the giant pandas as well as local facilities in the province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would also like to thank the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office for sending leading officials to Sichuan and working with us to arrange the early arrival of the giant pandas in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee and his delegation will visit the Dujiangyan base of the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, said she hoped the pandas could arrive before the National Day celebrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If conditions allow, we can try to bring more than two pandas to Hong Kong for a short stay to see if they can adapt. Of course, in the end, we may have to choose the two pandas who have the most fun in Hong Kong to stay here," she said.

 Students who have achieved a perfect score in the International Baccalaureate (IB) exams have expressed their desire to make a positive impact in their chosen fields and contribute to society.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They come from seven schools run by the English Schools Foundation, which was proud to see 17 of its students achieve a perfect score of 45, more than double the number who did so last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them is Tsang Chi-him from King George V School. He expressed his desire to become a doctor to help alleviate the shortage of medical staff in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do realise that Hong Kong currently has a shortage of doctors, and I do wish to help alleviate this problem. I would like to give back to my community as well, and help with the situation here in Hong Kong as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another student from the same school shared her aspirations to study bioengineering at the University of California in Los Angeles and return to Hong Kong after graduation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just in the LA area, especially there is a lot of startups and a lot of advancements regarding the bioengineering industry, and there's just a lot more working opportunities there," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I do hope to come back to Hong Kong, because I do know that the bioengineering industry in Hong Kong is growing really rapidly right now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Christopher Dingcong, a top scorer from Sha Tin College, plans to study aerospace engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to pursue a degree outside of Hong Kong, because for me, specifically I'm doing aerospace engineering, and abroad, there are many universities with much more experience in that," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Here in Hong Kong, it's still okay. Of course we have it, but just the land and the landscape doesn't really lend itself to having those facilities that they would often need for aerospace engineering like runways or stuff like that for aircraft."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Baccalaureate Organisation has previously confirmed that some candidates appeared to have leaked exam questions on social media before other students in later time zones sat the same papers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rob Shorthouse, ESF's director of strategy and communications, said the incident had not affected the performance of ESF students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the results that our students have achieved, while it was an unwelcome distraction, it hasn't had an impact. Our students have done very, very well and we're proud of every single one of them," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 2,400 Hong Kong students sat the IB exams this year, with at least 29 of them achieving the highest possible score. The average score was 36.63, higher than the global average of 30.32.

 Police arrested two teenagers on Sunday on suspicion of stealing a minibus in Mong Kok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a minibus driver reported at around 7am that his vehicle, parked on Sai Yeung Choi Street South, had gone missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police later found the minibus near the Sheung Shui MTR station and arrested the two suspects, aged 19 and 13, nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were detained on suspicion of taking conveyance without authority, driving without a licence and without third-party insurance.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Councillor Lam Ching-choi said on Sunday that officials are exploring the use of advanced technology, such as facial recognition, in housing estates to prevent elderly people with cognitive impairment from getting lost.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam, who heads an advisory committee on mental health, mentioned that tracking devices are currently being used on some elderly people with cognitive impairment. These technologies can enable them to get out and about without getting lost, which is good for their mental wellbeing and that of their carers, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The use of facial recognition and artificial intelligence is one of the methods. This will certainly require the consent of the elderly and their family members," Lam said after attending a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of such products that have been tested, and the success rate is high. So by using different types of technology, results can be achieved."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another matter, Lam expressed concern about the shortage of staff in residential care homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He revealed that there is currently a shortage of 20 to 30 percent of the required staff, even after the arrival of 7,000 imported workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To address this, the government plans to import about 8,000 workers in phases over the next three years, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested exploring cooperation with training organisations on the mainland so that caregivers can obtain the necessary licences before coming to work in Hong Kong.

    Visually-impaired passengers get HK Express apology

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Express Airways on Sunday apologised to two passengers, who are visually impaired, after staff asked them to leave a flight to Tokyo in May.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move came after the Hong Kong Blind Union said two of its members had complained that they had been unreasonably forced to leave the plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference, the union said the airline had cited safety reasons for asking them to leave. The Blind Union's president, Billy Wong, said a new approach was needed from the Civil Aviation Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a supervisory and coordinating agency and a government department, we hope the Civil Aviation Department can do more to help people with visual impairments or disabilities so they can use these services easily and equally in Hong Kong, which is an aviation hub," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the budget carrier said it was sorry for the inconvenience and delay caused to the passengers and promised to provide compensation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its ground staff and crew members had different assessments of the two passengers who had initially been unable to board their original flight as scheduled following, what it described as, a thorough assessment by management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the airline said it was later confirmed that both passengers could safely travel unaccompanied and staff immediately arranged for them to board another flight on the same day.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business remained resilient despite geopolitical headwinds last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said assets under management stood at more than HK$31 trillion in 2023, up about 2.1 per cent year-on-year, with two-thirds of the assets coming from outside the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that the SAR remained the second largest private equity management centre after the mainland, with private equity fund assets exceeding HK$1.7 trillion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The above figures show that despite the changing international geopolitical situation, investors still have confidence in the prospects of the mainland and Hong Kong markets," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is important for us to do our job well and continue to explain how the country is steadily improving, the central government's strong support for Hong Kong and the unique benefits under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the city's flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, had announced that it would buy back the remaining preference shares from the government this month, showing that the aviation industry was moving towards full normalcy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Baccalaureate or I-B has released results for its May diploma exams, with at least 29 Hong Kong students achieving the highest possible score.
 <br>
  <br/>
  IB issued the results to the schools on Friday night, and students were able to access their individual results on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the local top-scorers, 17 students from the English Schools Foundation’s seven schools achieved a perfect score of 45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also four top-scoring students from Diocesan Boys' School and two from Victoria Shanghai Academy, Yew Chung International School and Singapore International School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One top performer each hails from St. Paul's Co-educational College, St Stephen's College and Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  23 local students attained the top grade in the 2023 exam.

    Customs uncover first underground cigarette factory

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Saturday said they have uncovered the first ever underground cigarette factory in Lau Fau Shan. They said the facility was equipped with a complete production line.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authorities also uncovered a cigarette storage warehouse in Man Kam To and seized over 20 million suspected illicit cigarettes and about 3.5 tonnes of processed tobacco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the haul had a market value of HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four men, aged 29 to 46 were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs division commander Lam Chak-lun said the investment in this cigarette production line had been huge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “First, it was located in a large-scale, airtight prefabricated building. And the building was heavily insulated with industrial soundproofing material, hidden inside a factory,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It can effectively block light and noise generated while the machines are running. It was also powered by solar panels, likely to avoid drawing attention from authorities due to high electricity usage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities said they believed the production line was on a test run and had only been operational for a short time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two women accused of kidnapping a three-year-old boy in Tseung Kwan O were remanded in custody after appearing in court on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair, Xue Shanshan and Leung Lai-wa, both unemployed, faced a charge of kidnapping for allegedly forcibly taking the boy against his will from a mall on Wednesday with the intent of obtaining ransom in exchange for the child's release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boy, allegedly taken for a ransom in cryptocurrency, was rescued by officers in a flat in Tseung Kwan O on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern Court Magistrate Don So rejected a bail application from one of the women, and the other did not apply for bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case has been adjourned until September 23.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare secretary Chris Sun on Saturday expressed confidence that a lawyer appointed to chair a statutory body overseeing social workers will command the respect of the sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Herman Hui was among 12 new members picked by the government to the reformed Social Workers Registration Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after a radio programme, the minister acknowledged that the board's chairperson was not a registered social worker, but noted his status within the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Herman [Hui] is well-known in the welfare field. He has been serving the sector for more than 30 years. While he's not a registered social worker, I'm sure for those in the welfare sector, Herman is so well-known because of his dedication, commitment, and also selfless service to the sector. I'm sure he's going to command the respect of the sector," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said it did not matter where the board members came from, following suggestions that the government could bring in representatives from smaller organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said members were appointed to the statutory body on a personal basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They are requested to carry out their duties dutifully, and not having regard to where they are coming from. There's no difference for those coming from larger, smaller, or medium-sized welfare organisations, because they look after social workers from an independent point of view," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Social Workers Registration Board was only concerned with the registration of individual social workers, and not welfare institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not relevant whether or not they are coming from larger or smaller organisations in the field," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grace Chan, the business director of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, is the deputy chairperson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other members include former permanent secretary for labour and welfare Annie Tam, as well as members of the government's social welfare advisory committee, Frederick Lai and Barry Wong, who are all part of a coalition, the Hong Kong Social Welfare Sector Heart to Heart Joint Action.

    HK 'hoping for locally-bred panda': Kevin Yeung

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tourism chief Kevin Yeung says the SAR delegation to Sichuan will discuss matters such as transport and quarantine arrangements for the two giant pandas. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760485_1_20240706102646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong officials plan to tell Beijing of the SAR's desire for a locally bred giant panda during a visit to fine-tune the arrangements for two animals that the central government is giving to the city, according to the tourism chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, also said on Saturday that he hoped the two giant pandas will arrive in the city in two to three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister, along with Chief Executive John Lee, his wife, and other officials, are set to head to Sichuan on Sunday to know more about the arrival of the two giant pandas and discuss transport and quarantine arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Yeung said local officials are expressing their wish to see the birth of the city's first panda cub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that most people in the SAR would like to see pandas being born in Hong Kong. We've expressed this wish," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, the central government is gifting us a pair of giant pandas. I believe they'll take our wish into consideration. But in the end, it's up to the central government and mainland departments to decide."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the two animals could come to Hong Kong in around two to three months, but it would ultimately depend on their conditions after quarantining for a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's tourist figures, Yeung said he is confident that this year could see 46 million arrivals, with more people expected to visit Hong Kong during the summer and public holidays in the latter half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he conceded that spending patterns have changed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The retail sector, as a whole, cannot simply rely on spending from tourists to boost sales... Other than thinking of ways to attract tourists to spend more here, we also need to look for ways to have people in Hong Kong spend more," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said authorities will conduct test runs at the Kai Tak Sports Park in early 2025 by hosting a sporting event and a performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that the administration hoped to have around 50,000 people test out the venue and transport arrangements.

 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Sichuan on Sunday for a three-day visit to know more about arrangements for the arrival of two giant pandas from the province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was announced on Monday that the central government will send the pandas to Hong Kong as gifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a government statement, Lee and his delegation will visit the Dujiangyan Base of the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. He will also meet with leaders of Sichuan Province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's wife; Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung; director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department Mickey Lai; and representatives from Ocean Park will be joining the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE thanked the mainland authorities for their support, adding that the SAR government will make adequate preparations in receiving the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thank the Sichuan Provincial Government for attaching importance to the overall arrangements of gifting giant pandas to the HKSAR," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will meticulously deliberate on and understand the preparatory work for receiving the two new members of the Hong Kong family. The HKSAR Government will endeavour to make good arrangements for welcoming the giant pandas."

    'Govt mulls cutting Tai Lam Tunnel tolls'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government may introduce time-varying tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760439_1_20240705205800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the government is considering various proposals that would reduce tolls at the Tai Lam Tunnel after taking control of it in May next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, tolls for private cars and taxis stand at HK$58.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities have met representatives from various political parties to discuss the proposed changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One idea being floated is to charge private cars from HK$20 to HK$45, based on the time of the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also proposals to lower the tolls for private cars and taxis to HK$35 or HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another option under consideration is to keep the current tolls unchanged, but officials fear that may lead to congestion at nearby Tuen Mun Road, Tolo Highway and Ting Kau Bridge during the rush hour by 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who is a member of Legco transport panel, called on the government to introduce time-varying tolls at the tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At one hand, we need to ensure that even during peak hours, Tai Lam Tunnel can continue to be a convenient and not very congested route for different users, especially for our commercial vehicles, because that's a very important corridor for Hong Kong logistics industry," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, the residents, they do have very high expectation of a toll reduction of the Tai Lam Tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien urged the government to lower tolls to less than HK$35.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've always used the VC ratio, which is the volume capacity ratio of 1.2 as a basis of calculation. If we use VC ratio of 1, which means the capacity is equal to the volume, every single bridge and tunnel in Hong Kong will be considered overcapacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the couple of scenarios that they use all resulted in the Ting Kau Bridge having a volume capacity ratio less than 1.2. If that's the case, we still have room for the downward adjustment."

    Calls for more support for women to rejoin workplace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB says many women encounter difficulties when trying to find jobs after a break. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760429_1_20240705195809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday called for greater support for women to re-enter the workforce as part of efforts to tackle a manpower shortage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party said only 56 percent of women in Hong Kong are working, a figure that is lower than other regions of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said women who chose to leave their jobs to give birth or take care of their family members face difficulties when trying to return to the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is hard for women to go back to work after leaving for a while. They face difficulties such as low education background and no relevant experience, and there is not enough support for them. Is it a must for women to pick between family and work rather than having it all?” Quat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Associate professor Dai Haijing from the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Social Work Department said women still face workplace discrimination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe the gender effect is still there because the majority of caregivers in the world, they are women. Fathers are doing pretty well in Hong Kong compared with other places in the world... [while] filial daughters taking care of their ageing parents are being penalised in the labour market,” Dai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong turns out to be very conservative in terms of gender ideology; there should be some advocacy for gender equality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another DAB lawmaker, Frankie Ngan, urged the government to take the lead in expanding childcare services, such as setting up childcare centres in government facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also suggested that the Employees Retraining Board provide more flexible courses to mothers, among other ideas.

    Legco approves three percent civil service payrise

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers approved a three percent pay rise for civil servants. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760410_1_20240705172551.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday approved a three percent pay rise for all civil servants, with the increase backdated to the start of April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government asked for HK$8.7 billion to cover the rises, which also apply to teachers and those working at the ICAC and other subvented bodies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A pay trend survey had pointed to increases of between 4.01 percent to 5.47 percent for civil servants of various ranks, but officials stressed those numbers were only one factor to consider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several unionist lawmakers said the government needs to explain further why it decided on rises lower than the survey indicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung described the three percent increase as reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She stressed that a key factor this year is the administration's deficit, and its goal of achieving a fiscal balance in three years or so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we have significant expenses this year, it will affect the government's progress in trying to achieve fiscal balance. So we have thought about this. We have tried to strike a balance with different factors," she told Legco's Finance Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it is not the case that we will not follow or deviate from the pay trend indicators. It would depend on the circumstances of the year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip said it's high time the government revamped the pay adjustment system for civil servants, saying some staff have left and other people don't want to join because workers get paid the same, regardless of their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Hong Kong could look to Singapore, which pays its government workers through different types of bonuses on top of a basic salary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said in response that officials would need to consider such a move carefully, including whether the public would accept the idea of civil servants receiving bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added, however, that she agreed officials need to work on ways to create more incentives for civil servants to perform even better.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Greenpeace survey suggests many people are sceptical about the recent ban on restaurants giving customers plastic cutlery, saying it does little to reduce waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The green group interviewed around 1,000 adults in May, seeking their views on the move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 60 percent said they felt the new rules have little impact on waste reduction, while seven in 10 said they still threw away disposable cutlery made from alternative materials such as pulp or bamboo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam said on Friday that it means little that the cutlery is eco-friendly, if it still ends up in landfills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an effort to raise awareness on sustainability, the group collaborated with local artist Kevin Cheung to create an eight-metre whale-shaped installation from over 2,000 pieces of disposable tableware. It will be on display at the West Kowloon Cultural District until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This whale shows the volume of disposable cutlery used ... our environment is still suffering," Tam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace is calling on authorities to subsidise restaurants which provide reusable tableware with takeaway orders, saying it is the most direct means to cut down waste.

    'Everyone equal on reformed social workers body'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The new chairperson of the Social Workers Registration Board, Herman Hui, on Friday said he sees no differences between anyone on the reformed statutory body, whether they are appointed or elected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After taking an oath of allegiance to the SAR on Friday, Hui pledged to help the board stay on task, enhance the recognition and professional status of registered social workers, and make the board more transparent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the priorities will be establishing a mechanism to handle social workers convicted of national security crimes and other serious offences, Hui added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On whether people who have been convicted of serious offences are suitable to be social workers, we must make decisions based on the law. If the law says there are special circumstances, we will ask others on the board to consider if certain people are special cases and if they can continue to be registered as social workers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All but one of the elected board members recently resigned, but Hui said there's no difference between appointees and those who are voted onto the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the remaining elected board member is no different than the others. We are all serving the community and the board. I don't see any difference in that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another urgent matter for me to carry out immediately is to arrange for the coming term's elections to elect new members."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oscar Lai, the sole remaining elected board member, said he believed Hui is capable of chairing the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had worked with him in some youth uniformed groups, and I thought he's a reasonable person. I hope he could lead the board out of this difficult situation," Lai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam, who's also a registered social worker, said the new appointees could help the statutory body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of them are actually very experienced social workers in the field. They have a lot of network," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They can give their experience to the board, and enhance the professional development of our board."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector legislator Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said prioritising the election of board members would make the body's structure more comprehensive.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Friday that the local legal profession is among sectors that will see greater development opportunities on the mainland once new liberalisation measures under the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) are finalised.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More details will be announced once the two sides formally sign the new agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said CEPA reinforces the SAR's role as a bridge between the mainland and the rest of the world, adding that Hong Kong builds connections and encourages open trade as an international financial and legal hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech at a conference on international law and peaceful co-existence, he said implementation of the new CEPA agreement will also allow the SAR to contribute to the peaceful settlement of international disputes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Legal practitioners from Hong Kong will have greater room to do business on the mainland. And that can only accelerate Hong Kong's rise as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region," the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now that's a good news story for our legal professionals and the sector in general."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that a traditional Chinese belief is that "peace is the most precious" thing, noting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of China pronouncing the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although seven decades have passed since the five principles were announced, they are still very much present, and needed, in today's turbulent world," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has appointed 12 new members to a statutory body overseeing social workers, with a lawyer named as its chairperson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, lawmakers passed a government bill to reform the Social Workers Registration Board, increasing the number of government appointees and requiring all members to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The board is being expanded from 15 to 27 members, with the number of appointees rising from eight to 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a government gazette on Friday, the administration appointed lawyer Herman Hui, who used to sit on a number of government committees, to chair the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grace Chan, the business director of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, will serve as the board’s deputy chairperson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other newly appointed members include an assistant director of the Social Welfare Department, Chan Chong-lai, and former permanent secretary for labour and welfare Annie Tam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Amy Chow, who heads the University of Hong Kong's department of social work and social administration, as well as members of the government's social welfare advisory committee, Frederick Lai and Barry Wong, are also among the new appointees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appointments were announced on Friday with immediate effect, and their term will last for three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said 18 board members pledged their allegiance to the SAR, while two others were unable to attend the ceremony due to other matters and would take their oaths later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The labour and welfare chief, Chris Sun, said the reformed board would more effectively safeguard public interest and national security, promoting the orderly development of the profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All but one of the existing elected board members recently resigned, including former chairman Ng Yut-ming.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan has attended a United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva, where he pointed out that Hong Kong had fulfilled its constitutional duty to enact local national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Acting as the deputy head of China's delegation, he noted that the One Country, Two Systems principle has been the cornerstone of the SAR's long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the meeting on Thursday, Chan said: "In March this year, with overwhelming support from the public and our Legislative Council, we finally fulfilled our constitutional duty to enact local legislation to safeguard national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the city's economy is growing and vibrant, and that since late 2022, government talent admission schemes had attracted more than 320,000 applications from all over the world. This, he said, served as a clear vote of confidence in the city's bright future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a government statement said the UN meeting discussed and formally adopted the review report on China, which includes contents about the Hong Kong SAR of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review of the Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review report of the working group covered a total of 428 recommendations raised with China by United Nations member states, including 24 pertaining to the SAR, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said that "the Hong Kong SAR government has been steadfastly joining the country in the review".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the territory has "actively responded to the views and suggestions about the human rights situation of the Hong Kong SAR from some countries, and sternly rebutted the unfounded and untrue remarks from a small number of countries".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The dean of the University of Hong Kong's business school, Cai Hongbin, said at least 30 people had cheated their way into the school through the use of false documents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school revealed in May that it was investigating “a small number of people" who had secured admissions with fake degrees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with mainland media outlet Caixin on Thursday, Cai said the investigation has so far uncovered more than 30 people who got into the school fraudulently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He believes the number could reach 80 to 100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cai said agencies that claimed to offer "guaranteed admission" had forged transcripts and diplomas from overseas universities, and that some students might have been kept in the dark about what had happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, police said they have arrested two women linked to the scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the suspects, 24, was charged with the use of a false instrument, while the case of another suspect, 34, was still under investigation. Both are mainland residents and two-way permit holders.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Finnish conductor Tarmo Peltokoski has been named the new music director of the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HK Phil), succeeding Dutch maestro Jaap van Zweden from the 2026-27 season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old is the youngest director in the philharmonic's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his debut with the orchestra at a concert in June last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK Radio 4, Peltokoski compared the experience of leading the HK Phil to driving a luxury car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's absolutely world class. So it's a luxury car, so to say. I actually don't drive actual cars, but now I can drive the HK Phil. I was super impressed. We had our first rehearsal, and I'm excited for the years to come," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The award-wining composer studied piano at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, and is also interested in music comedy and improvisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January 2022, he was awarded “Principal Guest Conductor” of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen in Germany, the first conductor to hold the position in the orchestra’s 42-year history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Cogman, chairman of HK Phil's board of governors, said he is delighted to welcome the Finnish musician on board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a remarkable and visionary musician, and we are very fortunate that he will write the next chapter in our orchestra’s history," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive of HK Phil, Benedikt Fohr, said the appointment of Peltokoski marked a significant milestone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a highly talented musician from the younger generation. Under his leadership, we wish to inspire a new generation of music lovers, and continue to enhance our artistic excellence and elevate our reputation in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested two women for allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old boy in Tseung Kwan O for crypto ransom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They received a report from a woman that her son was taken from a mall on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boy was rescued by officers in the flat of one of the suspects on Thursday morning. He had no apparent injury and was sent to hospital for observation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the two suspects had financial difficulties. They also said there's no evidence they knew the boy's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that one of the suspects took the victim by force and moved him to a quieter place nearby, like a park, in a stroller. Another suspect put the kid in a suitcase and then moved him to the flat," said chief superintendent Kwan King-pan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said one of the suspects is an HKID holder and the other holds a two-way permit. Both are 38 and unemployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspects asked the boy's family to pay the ransom in cryptocurrency possibly because it's harder to trace, but no ransom was paid.

    Govt to tender one residential site this quarter

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday announced that it will put only one residential site up for tender this quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A plot at Shiu Lek Yuen in Sha Tin is expected to generate 570 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the authorities will not be selling any commercial sites this quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is also a hard fact that the vacancy rate for the commercial floor area in the economy is now on the high side. According to some recent statistics, it is around 13 percent. So, taking into account the market condition, we think we have a reason not to roll out commercial sites in this quarter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also said the government's land sales, private property developments and urban renewal projects in the first two quarters will provide a total of 4,065 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will meet around one-third of the target of 13,200 units for this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to sell a total of eight residential sites this financial year, including six unsold sites from the previous land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Lands Department, only one piece of land was sold between April and June. The plot, which went for almost HK$82 million, will be used for a charging station for electric vehicles.

    Ladies only: KMB route driven solely by female drivers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In a first for Hong Kong, KMB has earmarked a bus route which will be served exclusively by female drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The franchised bus operator is also adding more female-friendly staff facilities in the hope of attracting more women to join its ranks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting this month, KMB's route 69 between Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long will be handled by 11 female bus captains. A second such route is also on the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A new resting room installed at the Tin Shui Wai terminus was also designed with female users in mind. It includes a changing room and a full-length mirror.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas Mak, head of operations at the company's Tuen Mun depot, said the bus operator is keen to smash a common stereotype that female drivers are not as good on the roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that women currently make up eight percent of KMB's 10,000 drivers. The company's goal is to increase this to 10 percent.

    STARLUX hopes to add more Hong Kong-Taipei flights

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taiwan-based airline STARLUX on Thursday said it aims to operate up to five daily round trips between the island and Hong Kong in the future.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its first flights between Hong Kong and Taipei will take off on July 16, with two round trips each day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tony Cho, the airline's mainland China chief representative and Hong Kong branch general manager, said the coming year is the right time to boost passenger flight frequency, when Chek Lap Kok's third runway comes into full operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline is capable of increasing its manpower from the current 18 members of staff stationed in Hong Kong, Cho added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to compete with each other among this industry, but we also cooperate with them," he said. "We need more frequency to serve Taiwan and Hong Kong, and other areas for our business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In celebration of the new flights, a STARLUX-themed tram will run until the end of September, and there will be a sightseeing journey across Hong Kong Island later in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Tramways, which has partnered with the airline, said the collaboration will attract more tourists from Taiwan to visit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nixon Cheung, the tram operator's head of commercial and brand, said the public transport firm has seen a surge in passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do have a great rebound during the past years, especially when we have many free ride days, that catered to a lot of customers, especially tourists flying from all over the world," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ocean Park Conservation Foundation on Thursday said it had retrieved the carcasses of two dolphins from Pui O Beach on Lantau, to try to find out why they died.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The foundation said one of the dolphins was a newborn, while the other was a severely decomposed adult of 2.4 metres in length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation urged people to report any stranded dolphins or whales to the 1823 government hotline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also called on people not to use shampoos or body washes while on boats, to prevent ocean pollution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s Assistant Scientific Manager, Dr Edgar Leung, estimated that the two Chinese white dolphins died over a week ago. He added that based on past experience, it will be almost impossible to find out the cause of their deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since 2006… we have investigated over 600 cetacean stranding cases altogether. However, most of the carcasses were found severely decomposed, like these two cases. Therefore, the cause of death is hard to determine. Only 10 percent of them can be addressed,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said possible causes of death include entanglement in fish nets or a bacterial infection. He said a necropsy will be carried out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Dolphin Conservation Society, Taison Chang, also said it will be very difficult to determine the cause of the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because mainly of the condition of the decomposed body. Most of the time, dead bodies recovered are very decomposed. So even if there is like a cut by a fishing line or a cut by propellers of a boat, the decomposed part, the body tissue, can easily mask the injury," he said.

    More measures for non-Chinese people on the way: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said more measures are on the way to make life easier for non-Chinese people in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came days after Beijing's move to allow non-Chinese permanent residents of the SAR to apply for a five-year mainland travel permit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the China Conference, hosted by the South China Morning Post, Lee hailed the new arrangement as a groundbreaking policy development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is actually a big policy breakthrough. The first step I have done to create convenience for non-Chinese friends in Hong Kong is that for any staff of a company set up in Hong Kong, there has been a fast-track procedure for them to apply for a visa to visit mainland China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So that is step one, and now we have step two, and there will be more steps coming. I hope I will deliver more to you in due course."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the measures underline Hong Kong's unique advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle, attracting companies and professionals to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong will continue to strengthen its competitiveness and role as a gateway between the mainland and global markets.

    Legco passes bill to reform social worker board

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco has passed a bill that the government says will get the Social Workers Registration Board back on the right track.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill to reform the Social Workers Registration Board, increasing the number of government-appointed members.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The board will be expanded from 15 to 27 members, with the number of appointees rising from eight to 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All members will be required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new law also stipulates that social workers who are convicted of a national security offence will be permanently stripped of their licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All lawmakers who spoke on the bill supported it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB chairman Gary Chan said reforming the composition of the board will ensure that different voices within the sector are properly represented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the changes have righted some wrongs, and the bill's passage shows Legco wants the sector to start afresh and return to providing professional services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Welfare Secretary Chris Sun thanked lawmakers for supporting the bill, saying the legal changes will allow the board to get back on the right track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe with the strengthened composition of the board, it will encourage more young people to study social work and be a social worker. With a broadened board, it will provide better protection and certainty to the profession," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe [the new board] will strengthen the professional development of the whole profession as well as strengthen its role to ensure national [security]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past three weeks, all but one of the existing elected board members resigned, including former chairman Ng Yut-ming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said there is no need to hold by-elections for their seats, because they left with less than a year of their terms remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new law will be gazetted on Friday, when an oath-taking ceremony will take place and the list of appointed members will be announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that he hopes the new board can quickly review the members of its disciplinary committee panel, as well as the social worker code of practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said it should set up a mechanism to ensure the prompt handling of social worker registration for those who have committed serious crimes such as national security offences, as well as a framework for the continuous development of the profession.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers say they have charged a 27-year-old man with trafficking dangerous drugs after a tip-off from their Australian counterparts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Between them, authorities in the two places seized 13.5 kilogrammes of methamphetamine and six kilogrammes of cocaine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drugs, with a combined street value of HK$12 million, were being sent from the SAR to Australia inside stone statues, SAR officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police in Perth arrested a 17-year-old boy, while the Hong Kong arrest was made in Tsim Sha Tsui on June 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Earlier in June, the Australian enforcers have notified us that they intercepted an air cargo shipment from Hong Kong to Australia. The shipment was declared as a collection of stone statues. The statues were found to conceal around six kilogrammes of suspected cocaine. Customs subsequently took over the investigation,” said investigator Chris Kwan from the department's drug investigation bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We swiftly identified three more shipments that were about to be sent from Hong Kong to Australia. They were also declared as stone statues or Feng Shui decorations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said officers discovered a unit in a Tsim Sha Tsui commercial building where drugs were being concealed in statues and decorations before being smuggled to other locations.

    PolyU plans to apply for Chang'e-6 soil samples

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University on Wednesday said it is planning to apply for lunar samples from the Chang’e-6 space mission.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The spacecraft returned on June 25, bringing back the first samples ever collected from the lunar face that can’t be seen from Earth. PolyU developed a device to collect the samples.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university previously acquired lunar soil samples collected in the Chang’e-5 mission from the China National Space Administration, including a 400 mg surface sample and a 42.6 mg deep drill sample.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Yung Kai-leung, who heads the university’s Research Centre for Deep Space Explorations, said such samples are hard to come by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The lunar regolith is very very precious. Even if you are able to get 400 milligrammes, even for one crystal or one particle of the lunar regolith, we will be able to actually tell a lot of stories from there,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung said the team is eager to compare soil samples from both sides of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That actually has a lot of significance. Because we can see the front side, meaning that side is actually protected by Earth, especially from the magnetic field and the Earth’s gravity,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But on the far side, it’s open to the bombardment of all the different meteorites as well as solar winds, direct effect from the solar system.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team will also look into finding water in moon soil by analysing its content and formation process.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Liu Chun-san says officials will examine issues such as aviation safety and airspace management. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760073_1_20240703133950.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that it is proactively promoting the development of a low-altitude economy on various fronts and a senior official will be appointed to coordinate these efforts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The use of low-altitude airspace has become a prominent topic of discussion on the mainland, with the emergence of delivery drones, flying taxis and other aircraft for emergency services and agriculture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing sees the development of a low-altitude economy as one of the new engines of growth, and the SAR government has been repeatedly urged to catch up with the national development strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco meeting, Deputy Secretary for Transport and Logistics Liu Chun-san told lawmakers that his bureau will work with the Civil Aviation Department to examine issues such as aviation safety and airspace management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of air safety, the government will take a gradual approach to start from the near to the far and from the light to the heavy to gradually widen and enrich the application scenarios of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On management of low altitude airspace, with public interest in mind, the aerial routes of AAM should be far away from populated areas. There should be a safe distance with buildings and structures and the flights should not affect the civil aircraft taking off and landing at the airport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu said new large-scale development projects, such as the Northern Metropolis and the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands, can provide enough open space, community and commercial land to meet the infrastructure needs of a low-altitude economy.
