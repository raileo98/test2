<div class="itemFullText">
Chief Executive John Lee on Monday paid a visit to ice hockey players who were injured during a post-game fight between players from Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan at the Winter Asian Games in Harbin.
<br>
<br/>
SAR sports officials are demanding action from relevant authorities and have condemned the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmenistan athletes after Sunday's game.
<br/>
<br/>
Lee, who's in Harbin, went to the athletes' village to meet three Hong Kong players hurt in the brawl.
<br/>
<br/>
He said the trio were fine and should be able to play in Monday night's quarter-final clash against Kyrgyzstan.
<br/>
<br/>
The CE praised the players for staying calm and showing restraint during the incident, saying they showed professionalism and displayed sportsmanship.
<br/>
<br/>
"I encourage them to maintain the best mental condition and play with a professional attitude, not to be affected by any incident," Lee wrote on social media.
<br/>
<br/>
"I also expressed the support of Hong Kong people for the ice hockey team, and encourage the team members to keep it up and focus on the upcoming games."
<br/>
<br/>
The chief executive also called on the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to follow up on the matter, and ensure the safety of the SAR's athletes.
<br/>
<br/>
Lee was flanked by sports minister Rosanna Law and Chief Executive's Office director Carol Yip as he met the ice hockey team.

<div class="itemFullText">
Sunday's fight involving ice hockey players from Turkmenistan and Hong Kong, China may have escalated due to the physical nature of the sport.
<br>
<br/>
That's according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
<br/>
<br/>
"During the ice hockey game, it is quite violent. So in terms of our philosophy and sports development, there is a debate for games that have physical contact. If you play table tennis, you are separated [from your opponent] by the table. But for [contact] games like rugby, boxing, and ice hockey, how do we handle the emotions of athletes, that should be part of the game," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Louie added the incident would serve as a lesson for athletes to learn how to control their stress levels during and after competitions.
<br/>
<br/>
He made it clear that contact sports often have stricter rules to protect athletes.
<br/>
<br/>
"The athletes have to stand out for a couple of minutes, or may be they are suspended for a few games or are even [given] a more serious penalty," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Louie hoped the incident would not affect the performance of the Hong Kong, China team in later matches at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin, and urged more promotion of professional sports ethics among athletes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
The chef de mission of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Harbin Asian Winter Games, Kenneth Fok, on Monday said the international governing body for ice hockey has suspended four Turkmenistan players involved in an altercation with SAR players.
<br>
<br/>
Three Hong Kong players were injured in a post-match scuffle after defeating Turkmenistan 5-1 in a match on Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
Fok said the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&amp;OC) welcomed "the quick and fair response" from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
<br/>
<br/>
"We were notified on Monday afternoon that the IIHF has suspended with immediate effect the four Turkmen athletes, who had intentionally assaulted the Hong Kong team," he said in a statement.
<br/>
<br/>
Fok said the Turkmenistan players wouldn't be able to play in their final game of the tournament, a matchup for ninth place against Kuwait in Monday evening.
<br/>
<br/>
He also confirmed that the three SAR players only suffered light injuries and would be ready to play in the quarter-finals on Monday night.
<br/>
<br/>
"I want to emphasise that our Team Hong Kong China's players had always stayed respectful and friendly when competing, even when facing disrespectful and threatening actions," Fok said in a video released to the press before the suspension announcement.
<br/>
<br/>
"Our players definitely did not retaliate or do anything reckless. This is worthy of our praise and recognition."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Crystal Palace booked an FA Cup fifth round clash with south London rivals Millwall after a 2-0 win against fourth tier Doncaster.
<br>
<br/>
Oliver Glasner's side avoided a potential fourth round upset at the Eco-Power Stadium as Daniel Muñoz netted in the first half before Justin Devenny struck after the interval.
<br/>
<br/>
Palace will play second tier Millwall in the last 16 after the Lions won 2-0 at Championship leaders Leeds on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
It is the second time in three years that Palace have faced their hated neighbours in the FA Cup, with the Eagles winning 2-1 at The Den in the third round in 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
The local derby offers Palace forward Romain Esse a reunion with his former club after his US$14 million move from Millwall to Selhurst Park in January.
<br/>
<br/>
"I am told it will be a big derby. The game happened a few years ago? But it is good playing at home and it will be a great game for our fans," Glasner said of facing Millwall.
<br/>
<br/>
"They will be very aggressive but playing at home to a Championship side means we have to win. I want to go to Wembley," he added.
<br/>
<br/>
Palace, who finished as FA Cup runners-up in 2016 and 1990, are 12th in the Premier League and were beaten by Arsenal in the League Cup quarter-finals earlier this season.
<br/>
<br/>
The Eagles won 2-0 at Doncaster in the FA Cup fifth round six years ago and they repeated the scoreline on their latest visit.
<br/>
<br/>
"We could have decided it a bit earlier perhaps, but it was difficult circumstances with the pitch. The players did well most of the time and we scored nice goals," Glasner said.
<br/>
<br/>
Doncaster, currently third in League Two, kicked off as the lowest ranked team left in the FA Cup.
<br/>
<br/>
Grant McCann's team threatened an early opener when Billy Sharp picked out Ethan Ennis in the penalty area, but his shot lacked the power to beat Palace keeper Matt Turner.
<br/>
<br/>
Palace struggled to find any rhythm in the opening stages, but their superior quality finally shone through in the 31st minute.
<br/>
<br/>
Daichi Kamada's clever free-kick found Jean-Philippe Mateta beside the Doncaster wall and he fired against the post before Muñoz tapped in the deflected rebound.
<br/>
<br/>
Kamada tested Doncaster keeper Teddy Sharman-Lowe with a long-range blast as Palace hit their stride.
<br/>
<br/>
Luke Molyneux, with 13 goals for Doncaster this season, nearly added to his tally as he cut in from the right flank and drilled just wide.
<br/>
<br/>
England left-back Ben Chilwell came on for his Palace debut at half-time following his loan move from Chelsea last week.
<br/>
<br/>
Devenny squandered a golden opportunity to double Palace's lead when he blazed wide from Mateta's pass.
<br/>
<br/>
But the 21-year-old midfielder made amends to kill off Doncaster in the 55th minute.
<br/>
<br/>
Will Hughes's superb lofted pass sent Devenny scampering clear on goal and he guided a delicate chip over Sharman-Lowe from 12 yards. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Spain's former football federation chief Luis Rubiales gives his highly-anticipated version of events on Tuesday in the trial over his forced kiss on Jenni Hermoso that sparked global outrage.
<br>
<br/>
The case has riveted the country since opening on February 3 and has turned Hermoso into an icon of the fight against macho culture and sexism in sport.
<br/>
<br/>
Rubiales was forced to resign in disgrace in 2023 after kissing Hermoso on the lips following Spain's triumph at that year's Women's World Cup in Australia.
<br/>
<br/>
Prosecutors are seeking two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
<br/>
<br/>
Rubiales, 47, has called the kiss a "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
<br/>
<br/>
Up to now he has attended hearings without intervening as a slew of witnesses testified at the National Court near Madrid.
<br/>
<br/>
Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt "disrespected" after a non-consensual kiss that "should not happen in any social or work setting".
<br/>
<br/>
Her teammates have described how she cried and felt "overwhelmed" following the incident, while her brother Rafael Hermoso has said she came under pressure to downplay the incident to save Rubiales.
<br/>
<br/>
Former women's team manager Jorge Vilda and two ex-federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque, are also due to take the stand on Tuesday.
<br/>
<br/>
They are accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them.
<br/>
<br/>
Rubiales minimised the importance of the kiss on Hermoso at the time and defied calls for his resignation at an emergency federation meeting in August 2023, railing against "false feminism".
<br/>
<br/>
He resigned in September that year after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation into alleged sexual assault. (AFP)

Meanwhile, the SAR's men's curlers improved to 3-1 after beating Qatar 10-2 in group play.

<div class="itemFullText">
LIV golf is returning to Hong Kong in March, after the SAR hosted the tournament for the first time last year in Fanling.
<br>
<br/>
Hong Kong will be the third stop of the tournament, following Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Adelaide, Australia.
<br/>
<br/>
Patrick Reed, who won the Hong Kong Open last November, is among the players who are slated to take part.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Reed said he could not wait to return to the city.

<br/>
"I can't wait to come back. Coming back to the place where I got my 10th win, and also at the same time, to go out and shoot my first 59. It means a lot. I think the biggest thing is the spectators, the fans, the people at the golf course is just spectacular," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Also participating in the team matches, Reed said all his team members are motivated and are ready to give their best.
<br/>
<br/>
"Everyone out here I feel like is motivated to go out and play well. We're playing for huge prize purses, but at the same time we're playing for bragging rights over not only the other teams, but all the other players," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Another LIV player Max Lee, who won the tournament promotion game in Riyadh and previously won a BMW car at the 2023 Hong Kong Open, said the Fanling golf course suits his game.
<br/>
<br/>
"The Fanling golf course, it requires accuracy despite not being that far away, and there are different kinds of valleys. This is similar to where I usually practice. Also, the trees in Fanling are very tall, the wind directions varies. I am the kind of player that excels in hitting low golf shots, and my performance at the venue in the past few years have been satisfactory," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
The eventful journey of the Hong Kong, China men's ice hockey team at the Harbin Asian Winter Games came to an end on Tuesday, after they were dumped out of the quarter-finals 24-0 by top-seeded Kazakhstan.
<br>
<br/>
The Kazakhs are four-time gold medallists in the competition and are so far unbeaten in this year's tournament after six games.
<br/>
<br/>
The players from Hong Kong were outmatched early and often, trailing 8-0 after the first period.
<br/>
<br/>
The Kazakhs continued their strong play in the second by putting seven in the net, followed by another nine in the last period.
<br/>
<br/>
Four players scored a hat-trick against the SAR.
<br/>
<br/>
Hong Kong goalies Cheung Chi-ho and David Lam did manage 56 saves between them.
<br/>
<br/>
The SAR team made headlines after three of their players were injured in an altercation with Turkmenistan players following a group match on Sunday.

<div class="itemFullText">
South China on Tuesday won the local top division basketball championship in dramatic fashion.
<br>
<br/>
Guard So Pak-hin made a last-second shot as the Caroliners defeated Winling 81-79 in Game Four, for a three-one series win at the Southorn Stadium in Wan Chai.
<br/>
<br/>
South China entered the final period with a 20-point deficit, but they managed to erase it to take a one-point lead with a minute and a half to go.
<br/>
<br/>
Bench players led the rally, with Anson Lam scoring 13 points in the final period.
<br/>
<br/>
With the score tied in the final seconds, So, 23, hit a turnaround jumper with 0.3 seconds left to seal the classic victory.
<br/>
<br/>
The Most Valuable Player of the Finals belonged to guard Kelvin Tsang from South China, who became Hong Kong champions for the third time in the past four seasons.
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm so glad we listened to the coach and didn't quit," Tsang told RTHK in a post-game interview.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Jude Bellingham scored the winner in stoppage time as Real Madrid twice came from behind to inflict more misery on Manchester City with a 3-2 Champions League play-off, first leg win at the Etihad.
<br>
<br/>
Erling Haaland twice put City in front with his first goals in five games against Madrid.
<br/>
<br/>
But the holders hit back through Kylian Mbappé and Brahim Díaz before Bellingham stroked home in the 92nd minute on his return to England.
<br/>
<br/>
City now have a monumental task ahead to progress to the last 16 when the sides meet again in the Spanish capital on February 19.
<br/>
<br/>
The clubs were meeting for the fourth consecutive season in the Champions League, with the winners in each of the previous three years going on to lift the trophy.
<br/>
<br/>
If that familiarity did not breed enough contempt, Madrid's decision to boycott City midfielder Rodri's crowning as Ballon d'Or winner last year added extra animosity.
<br/>
<br/>
The midfielder was rewarded for his role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph and a fourth consecutive Premier League title.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the Spanish giants took umbrage at Vinicius Junior being overlooked for the prize and pulled out all of their representatives from the ceremony in October.
<br/>
<br/>
A huge banner before kick-off showed Rodri with the Ballon d'Or trophy alongside the lyric "Stop crying your heart out" from City-supporting band Oasis.
<br/>
<br/>
Rodri's absence since September with a season-ending knee injury has played a major role in City's decline this season as the English champions sit 15 points off the pace in the Premier League.
<br/>
<br/>
In recent years Madrid have been pegged back on the ropes at the Etihad, twice conceding four times in three visits.
<br/>
<br/>
This time the visitors had a series of early chances to sow more doubt in City minds.
<br/>
<br/>
Vinicius' every touch was booed and the home fans were delighted when he had a penalty ruled out for straying offside before he was wiped out by Ederson. The City goalkeeper then made a vital save from Mbappé and Nathan Ake deflected Ferland Mendy's shot wide with the goal gaping.
<br/>
<br/>
Pep Guardiola's men hit the visitors with a sucker punch on 19 minutes thanks to a brilliant team goal.
<br/>
<br/>
Jack Grealish's dinked cross was chested down by Josko Gvardiol into Haaland's path, who stayed millimetres onside before stroking home his 26th goal of the season.
<br/>
<br/>
Real came roaring back as Vinicius' effort came back off the bar.
<br/>
<br/>
City also hit the woodwork through Manuel Akanji and Thibaut Courtois was forced into a spectacular save from Phil Foden.
<br/>
<br/>
Haaland remained a constant threat to Madrid's injury-ravaged defence. Ancelotti was forced to name midfielders Federico Valverde and Aurelien Tchouameni in his backline alongside the inexperienced Raul Asencio.
<br/>
<br/>
Haaland's deflected effort that came back off the crossbar seconds into the second half proved a turning point as Madrid again took control. Bellingham headed wide and Ederson denied Mbappé as the pressure built before it finally told on the hour mark.
<br/>
<br/>
Mbappé's finish was far from his cleanest but his mishit from Dani Ceballos' cross deceived Ederson and looped into the net.
<br/>
<br/>
Madrid smelt blood and went for the kill. Valverde drilled inches wide before Bellingham should have scored when he shot low into the legs of Ederson.
<br/>
<br/>
But it was City who got the third goal when Foden was brought down by Ceballos as he weaved a way into the penalty area and French referee Clement Turpin pointed to the spot.
<br/>
<br/>
Haaland sent Courtois the wrong way for his 49th goal in 48 Champions League appearances.
<br/>
<br/>
Yet, by full-time the Norwegian was a disconsolate figure as City's poor campaign took another turn for the worse.
<br/>
<br/>
Díaz had only been on the pitch a matter of seconds when he fired in against his old club after Ederson parried Vinicius' effort into his path.
<br/>
<br/>
Moments later the Brazilian goalkeeper was caught in no man's land as Vinicius ran through and, even as his attempt was heading wide, Bellingham stole in for a simple finish. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Team Hong Kong, China secured a spot in the play-offs for the men's curling competition at the Harbin Asian Winter Games on Wednesday, achieving four wins out of five round-robin matches.
<br>
<br/>
In their final round-robin game, the SAR men's team dominated Saudi Arabia with a score of 15-1, ensuring their advancement to the play-offs.
<br/>
<br/>
Although they faced a setback in their opening match against the national team, they bounced back to defeat Thailand, Japan, Qatar and finally Saudi Arabia.
<br/>
<br/>
The SAR team will face Kazakhstan on Thursday for a spot in the semi-finals.
<br/>
<br/>
On the women's side, Hong Kong, China are gearing up for their final two round-robin matches against Qatar and Kazakhstan, having recorded two wins and four losses in their previous games.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, China swept the podium in both the mixed relay final of ski mountaineering and the women's freeski big air event.
<br/>
<br/>
In ski mountaineering, the pair of Cidan Yuzhen and Bu Luer clinched victory with a time of 27 minutes and 48.67 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
They were closely followed by compatriots Yu Jingxuan and Bi Yuxin, who finished 32.29 seconds behind, while Suolang Quzhen and Liu Jianbin secured third place, finishing a minute and 39 seconds later.
<br/>
<br/>
In the freeski big air event, Liu Menting delivered an impressive performance, winning with a score of 175.50 points, followed by fellow Chinese athletes Han Linshan and Yang Ruyi.
<br/>
<br/>
The national team also came out on top in cross-country skiing, securing victories in both the women's 4 x 5 kilometres relay and the men's 4 x 7.5 kilometres relay.
<br/>
<br/>
In the women's event, the team of Li Lei, Chi Chunxue, Chen Lingshuang and Dinigeer Yilamujiang finished in 53 minutes and 59.3 seconds. Kazakhstan took second place, while Japan completed the podium in third.
<br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association on Wednesday said the men's team put in a great performance at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
<br>
<br/>
The team wrapped up their journey on Tuesday after losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan 24-0 in the quarter-finals.
<br/>
<br/>
The association's chairman, Sherman Chan, said at least half of the Kazakhstan team are professional players, while many SAR players are either students or have full-time jobs.
<br/>
<br/>
He said Hong Kong's performance wasn't affected by a post-match altercation with Turkmenistan opponents on Sunday that left three of the SAR players injured.
<br/>
<br/>
"This game [against Kazakhstan] definitely showcased the team has been very disciplined as well as in terms of their quality, mental-wise, they are well prepared for any kind of challenge," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think obviously after the incident, a few of the players were upset. But... they mentally recovered very well and we all have this common goal to focus on the Games."
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said he has high expectations for Hong Kong when it comes to the World Championships in Mexico in April.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Arsenal's bid to win the Premier League could suffer a major setback following reports Kai Havertz is set to be ruled out for the remainder of the season.
<br>
<br/>
The German forward sustained an injury during the club's warm-weather training camp in Dubai and was due to face further tests on the club's arrival back in England.
<br/>
<br/>
The Athletic reported on Wednesday the 25-year-old Havertz had suffered a torn hamstring and could now miss the rest of the current campaign.
<br/>
<br/>
Arsenal, however, have yet to comment on the extent of Havertz's injury.
<br/>
<br/>
His potential long-term absence would though compound the problems confronting Gunners boss Mikel Arteta after Arsenal were unable to bolster their attack during the recent January transfer window.
<br/>
<br/>
The London club failed in an attempt to sign Ollie Watkins from Premier League rivals Aston Villa.
<br/>
<br/>
Havertz was set to lead Arsenal's line for the rest of the season, with Arteta even saying it was possible the Germany international would have to play every game.
<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel Jesus is already out for the season after he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last month, whle Bukayo Saka has been absent since December, although there are hopes the England international could return next month.
<br/>
<br/>
Gabriel Martinelli, meanwhile, is also sidelined after he was forced off injured during Arsenal's League Cup semi-final second-leg semi-final defeat at Newcastle last week.
<br/>
<br/>
All these absences leave the Gunners with only three recognised forward players in Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri.
<br/>
<br/>
Arteta may well speak about Havertz – who has scored 15 goals in 34 appearances this season – on Friday when he holds a pre-match press conference to preview the Gunners' league game away to Leicester.
<br/>
<br/>
Arsenal are presently second in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Liverpool but having played a game more, as they attempt to become champions of England for the first time in 21 years. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
James Tarkowski struck in the 98th minute to salvage a 2-2 draw for Everton against Liverpool in a dramatic final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.
<br>
<br/>
Liverpool edge seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, but were denied a vital win by Tarkowski's blistering strike after Mohamed Salah put Arne Slot's men in front.
<br/>
<br/>
Abdoulaye Doucoure, Curtis Jones and Slot were then sent off as tempers flared at the final whistle on a night Liverpool will come to regret if they do not go on to lift a record-equalling 20th English top flight title.
<br/>
<br/>
"Very tough," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We saw the celebrations they had in the end so we know how much it meant for them but the fact is it was disappointing for us."
<br/>
<br/>
Everton are set to move to a new 53,000 capacity stadium in Liverpool's Bramley Moore Dock next season and gave their home since 1892 a night to remember against their local rivals.
<br/>
<br/>
"Mental probably sums it up," said Everton boss David Moyes. "A brilliant finish for us, to finish the last Goodison Merseyside derby and score in the last minute is in a way fitting."
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool's quest for a quadruple came unstuck with a shock FA Cup exit to second-tier strugglers Plymouth on Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot made 10 changes as he resorted to his strongest available side with Salah and Virgil van Dijk among those who had been afforded the weekend off.
<br/>
<br/>
Everton's own FA Cup exit to Bournemouth on Saturday had punctured some of their momentum since David Moyes' return for a second spell in charge.
<br/>
<br/>
The Toffees had won their previous three Premier League games to pull nine points clear of the relegation zone and got off to a flying start.
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool were caught napping on 11 minutes by a quick free-kick by Jarrad Branthwaite to free Beto, who beat Alisson Becker for his third goal in two league games.
<br/>
<br/>
The visitors could have been swept away in the feverish atmosphere early on but the Reds immediate response was the making of champions.
<br/>
<br/>
Alexis Mac Allister started and finished the move as the diminutive Argentine midfielder ghosted into the penalty area to head in Salah's teasing cross.
<br/>
<br/>
Everton then suffered a huge blow as their creative hub Iliman Ndiaye limped off in tears after a long stoppage.
<br/>
<br/>
The first half never recovered its flow amid a flurry of fouls and yellow cards as the Premier League fixture with the most red cards in history threatened to boil over once more.
<br/>
<br/>
Everton started the better once more in the second period. Doucoure wasted a great chance to retake the lead when he headed wide when unmarked inside the area.
<br/>
<br/>
The home crowd briefly erupted once more when Branthwaite fired home only for the celebrations to be cut short by the offside flag.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot was growing visibly frustrated with his side's lack of penetration going forward and turned to his bench for an impact with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jones and Darwin Núñez sent on to find a winner.
<br/>
<br/>
The changes worked as Salah delivered what looked like a potential title-clinching moment.
<br/>
<br/>
Jones and Núñez exchanged a one-two and when the midfielder's shot was blocked by Branthwaite, it fell kindly for Salah to prod in his 27th goal of the season.
<br/>
<br/>
Only a brilliant save by Jordan Pickford crucially denied Salah a second late on. And Everton rallied when Liverpool failed to deal with a hopeful ball into the box and it fell to centre-back Tarkowski to fire into the top corner.
<br/>
<br/>
A lengthy VAR check followed for offside and Everton fans had to be cleared off the pitch before the game could restart.
<br/>
<br/>
When it did there was more fireworks as Doucoure and Jones were both shown a second yellow card for clashing after the Everton midfielder celebrated in front of the travelling Liverpool support.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot was also shown red for his protests towards referee Michael Oliver. (AFP)

Harry Kane was on target as Bayern Munich beat Celtic 2-1 in Glasgow in the first leg of their Champions League play-off, while there were also wins for Benfica, Feyenoord and Club Brugge.
<br>
<br/>
Bayern are hoping to go all the way to this season's final, which will be played at their own Allianz Arena in Munich on May 31.
<br/>
<br/>
They threatened to run riot against the Scottish champions at Celtic Park as they dominated the first half and took the lead just before the interval thanks to a superb Michael Olise strike.
<br/>
<br/>
Bayern's second goal came just four minutes after half-time, with the unmarked Kane scoring with a cushioned finish at the back post following a corner.
<br/>
<br/>
It was Kane's seventh goal in this season's Champions League, and his 29th in 29 games in all competitions.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the Bundesliga leaders took their foot off the pedal after that, allowing Celtic – who had a first-minute Nicolas Kuehn goal disallowed for offside – to come back into the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Brendan Rodgers' team pulled one back as Daizen Maeda scored following a corner with 11 minutes left, but they could not find an equaliser.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's cliche to say, but it's the first half of the game. Overall, it's a really great result," said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany, according to the BBC.
<br/>
<br/>
Celtic's first home defeat since December 2023 leaves them facing a huge task to try to turn the tie around in Germany next Tuesday, with the winners going through to face either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility," insisted Rodgers.
<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Vangelis Pavlidis scored the only goal as Benfica won 1-0 away to Monaco, as the home side were forced to play much of the second half with 10 men.
<br/>
<br/>
Benfica had won 3-2 in Monaco in the league phase in November and they came out on top again at the Stade Louis II thanks to a Pavlidis strike just after half-time.
<br/>
<br/>
It was the Greek international's sixth goal in his team's last five Champions League outings, a run which includes a hat-trick in the dramatic 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association has filed a complaint to the International Ice Hockey Federation regarding the altercation involving the Turkmenistan team at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
<br>
<br/>
Chairman Sherman Chan made the remarks upon returning to Hong Kong with the men's team on Thursday.
<br/>
<br/>
A brawl broke out after the SAR defeated Turkmenistan in a match on Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
Three SAR players were injured.
<br/>
<br/>
Team captain Tony Leung hopes the altercation will not affect people's impression of the sport.
<br/>
<br/>
He told reporters at the airport that he appreciated the team's restraint in the altercation.
<br/>
<br/>
"Clashes are inevitable in ice hockey. This incident is very rare, especially as it happened during a post-match handshake," he said,
<br/>
<br/>
"At the same time, there are rarely fights in international competitions, or even during the match. Therefore, this is an exceptional case."
<br/>
<br/>
He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.
<br/>
<br/>
Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.
<br/>
<br/>
He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, "a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.
<br/>
<br/>
"There were a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"We are going to get there. I promise Hong Kong that we will get there one day. It’s just a process that we take and we take this very seriously in representing Hong Kong."
<br/>
<br/>
The team wrapped up their journey at the Games by losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan in the quarter-finals.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Shenzhen Bay Port will be closed from 2am to 11am on February 23rd for a cross-border marathon event.
<br>
<br/>
At most 100 runners, six from Hong Kong, will take part in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon, which doubles as a test event for the 15th National Games.
<br/>
<br/>
The event later this month features a men's race and a women's race.
<br/>
<br/>
The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.
<br/>
<br/>
The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
<br/>
<br/>
They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
<br/>
<br/>
The Hong Kong section is about 21 kilometres in total.
<br/>
<br/>
Ken Wong, the Transport Department's principal transport officer, urged passengers to use the MTR East Rail Line to travel to Shenzhen via Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the day.
<br/>
<br/>
He also urged motorists to steer clear of border points while the race is on.
<br/>
<br/>
“According to operating records on a typical Sunday, there will be about 26,000 passengers, two-bound, using Shenzhen Bay Port... and according to our records, there will be about 2,000 cross-boundary private cars using Shenzhen Bay Port on a typical Sunday,” he said.
<br/>
<br/>
There will be no spectators for this event.
<br/>
<br/>
“Because the Hong Kong session for this race will be mostly either on the highway or in the restricted area near the cross boundary control points, so for this time there will not be any public viewing area for the general spectators,” Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office said.
<br/>
<br/>
The race will be broadcast live on RTHK’s website.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeung added that customs clearance arrangements for the athletes will be similar to the cross-border cycling test event in November last year.
<br/>
<br/>
“The athletes have to submit their information to the organising party. Once verified, there will be a facial recognition and the ID and passports will have to be vetted beforehand,” he said
<br/>
<br/>
He added that runners have to go through another round of inspection on the race day.

<div class="itemFullText">
Hope remains for the Hong Kong, China men's curling team, which is aiming to win the city's first ever medal at the Asian Winter Games, even after losing to South Korea in the semifinals on Thursday.
<br>
<br/>
The SAR squad of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap were outmatched early in Harbin.
<br/>
<br/>
Unable to catch up, they lost 2-13 against the South Koreans.
<br/>
<br/>
The result sent them into a bronze medal match on Friday morning against the national team, which lost 6-7 to the Philippines in the other semifinal.
<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, the SAR men's team beat Kazakhstan in the playoffs to win their spot in the final four.
<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time that Hong Kong has sent a curling team to the Games, and the men's team has now become the sole hope for the SAR to secure a spot on the podium.

<div class="itemFullText">
Pep Guardiola has taunted Premier League leaders Liverpool over their failure to match Manchester City's record 100-point tally.
<br>
<br/>
Guardiola's troubled side are trailing 16 points behind Liverpool after their bid for a fifth successive English crown collapsed.
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool are seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal as they chase a 20th title, which would equal Manchester United's record.
<br/>
<br/>
But even if Arne Slot's men go on to secure the trophy, they now cannot match the record points total set when City won the first of Guardiola's six titles in 2017-18.
<br/>
<br/>
Responding to criticism of City's faltering performance after Tuesday's 3-2 home defeat against Real Madrid in the Champions League play-off round first leg, Guardiola took a swipe at Liverpool.
<br/>
<br/>
"We took all the records in England. Who would do 100 points now in modern football? I'm waiting," Guardiola told reporters on Friday.
<br/>
<br/>
"Or four in a row? I'm waiting - with clubs like Bournemouth, Fulham and Wolves that you have to play.
<br/>
<br/>
"The standards, we dictated. Have you seen Liverpool this season? They cannot do 100 points already - 99 but not 100."
<br/>
<br/>
While Liverpool may not surpass fifth-placed City's record mark, Guardiola accepts his team have fallen behind their rivals this season.
<br/>
<br/>
"I asked 'Gundo' (Ilkay Gundogan) yesterday, 'two years ago you were here, you were one year in Barcelona and you come back here, did you see changes in the Premier League?'," said Guardiola, whose team host top four rivals Newcastle on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
"He said massively, the difference was unbelievable. It's the truth. The teams are much, much, much better in all departments. People prepare so well.
<br/>
<br/>
"We cannot do it for the (injury) problems we've had. There are a lot of players, with the amount of minutes they have had, who are so tired, emotionally as well.
<br/>
<br/>
"But guys, we deserve to have a bad season. We deserve not to be like we were. They are human beings, it can happen. We weren't consistent and we haven't had the players at their best.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's the first time that me and many of the players have lived this position but we have to accept it (and recognise) what happened in the past was not normal."
<br/>
<br/>
Guardiola believes the difference from previous successful seasons is that City are no longer making the most of their dominance of possession.
<br/>
<br/>
"I accept when the opponents have the ball, I'm going to suffer," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"But now we are suffering when we have the ball. It never happened before and, (right) now, I cannot change it. We are suffering because we are human beings." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month ban from tennis after the world number one admitted team mistakes led to him twice testing positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March last year.
<br>
<br/>
The February 9 to May 4 suspension means Sinner will be free to play in the French Open, the second grand slam of the season, which begins on May 25 at Roland Garros.
<br/>
<br/>
In a statement, Sinner said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) accepted that he "had no intent and did not derive any competitive advantage from the two positive tests."
<br/>
<br/>
Australian Open champion Sinner has always said that clostebol entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.
<br/>
<br/>
"This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year," Sinner said.
<br/>
<br/>
"I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise Wada's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis, I have accepted Wada's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction."
<br/>
<br/>
Wada said separately that "Sinner did not intend to cheat" but that he would serve his suspension as he is responsible for the actions of his entourage.
<br/>
<br/>
The agreement between Sinner and Wada means that Sinner will be able to play in front of his home fans at the Rome Open which kicks off just after the end of his suspension and is the last big clay court tournament before Roland Garros. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Arsenal brushed off their shortage of specialist strikers on Saturday as midfielder Mikel Merino scored both goals in a 2-0 win at Leicester City that kept the north London club's Premier League title challenge on track.
<br>
<br/>
Merino's brace allowed second-placed Arsenal to cut Liverpool's advantage to four points although the leaders will be confident of replying against Wolverhampton Wanderers ,later on Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
Champions Manchester City's title hopes may have long since vanished but they looked much more recognisable as recent signing Omar Marmoush bagged a hat-trick in 13 first-half minutes in a 4-0 rout of Newcastle United.
<br/>
<br/>
The win allowed City to climb into fourth place with 44 points, three points behind Nottingham Forest whose top-four ambitions suffered a dent in a 2-1 defeat at Fulham.
<br/>
<br/>
Bournemouth's challenge for the top four shows no sign of petering out as they won 3-1 at bottom club Southampton to move above Chelsea and Newcastle into fifth place.
<br/>
<br/>
When German forward Kai Havertz was ruled out for the season this week, joining Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Sako on the injured list, Arsenal fans must have feared the worst.
<br/>
<br/>
Mikel Arteta gave Raheem Sterling a place in his starting line-up at Leicester but the former Chelsea man had a torrid afternoon and was replaced by Merino after 69 minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
The Spaniard's impact was decisive as he broke the deadlock in the 81st minute from an assist by impressive teenager Ethan Nwaneri and he wrapped up the points in the 87th minute after good work by Leandro Trossard.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think the game started to suit (Merino) more because they started to defend much deeper, and we had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period," Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. "We believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it."
<br/>
<br/>
While Arsenal stayed on Liverpool's heels, Leicester's plight is precarious. They are 19th with 17 points after losing nine of their last 10 league matches.
<br/>
<br/>
Egyptian Marmoush had not scored for City since his move from Eintracht Frankfurt last month but he opened his account in explosive fashion against Newcastle.
<br/>
<br/>
The 26-year-old Marmoush gave City the lead in the 19th minute with a lob after Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier misjudged goalkeeper Ederson's long delivery.
<br/>
<br/>
Five minutes later he latched on to a pass from Ilkay Gundogan to fire home and then completed his hat-trick with a thumping shot after good work by Savinho.
<br/>
<br/>
"We knew sooner or later he would score goals, he is a good finisher. Of course he has to improve, but now we see how he handles the compliments," manager Pep Guardiola said.
<br/>
<br/>
The only blemish for City was Erling Haaland being forced off with an injury.
<br/>
<br/>
"I have not spoken to the doctor, but I was scared when he went down. Maybe it's not as bad as it could be," Guardiola said.
<br/>
<br/>
Chris Wood scored his 18th league goal of the season for Forest but it could not prevent his side slipping to defeat at Fulham for whom Emile Smith Rowe opened the scoring and Calvin Bassey headed the winner.
<br/>
<br/>
Bournemouth moved to fifth with 43 points, just one behind Manchester City, as goals by Dango Ouattara, Ryan Christie and Marcus Tavernier sealed the points in the south coast derby.
<br/>
<br/>
Relegation battlers Ipswich Town secured a well-earned point in a 1-1 draw at Aston Villa despite playing the entire second half with 10 men after Axel Tuanzebe was dismissed.
<br/>
<br/>
Ipswich still went ahead after the break when Liam Delap steered in Omari Hutchinson's low cross but Ollie Watkins equalised for Villa who dropped to ninth.
<br/>
<br/>
Ipswich are in 18th place with 17 points, two behind 17th placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.
<br/>
<br/>
Eleventh-placed Brentford beat West Ham United 1-0 away thanks to an early goal by Kevin Schade. They have now won three successive away games in the top flight for the first time ever. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.
<br>
<br/>
An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded line-ups of the North American rivals – which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries – erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre.
<br/>
<br/>
The US squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.
<br/>
<br/>
With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed "The Star-Spangled Banner" before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing into US borders.
<br/>
<br/>
Then came three fights in nine seconds.
<br/>
<br/>
"I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players," USA coach Mike Sullivan said. "There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries.
<br/>
<br/>
"For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred – I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game."
<br/>
<br/>
Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not pre-arranged.
<br/>
<br/>
"It wasn't planned," Cooper said. "That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' - none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets."
<br/>
<br/>
At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.
<br/>
<br/>
Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box.
<br/>
<br/>
The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight in the mayhem.
<br/>
<br/>
Asked about US players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move.
<br/>
<br/>
"These guys care very much about winning," he said. "Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play."
<br/>
<br/>
Top NHL players from the USA and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
<br/>
<br/>
"It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half," Cooper said.
<br/>
<br/>
The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period.
<br/>
<br/>
But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the USA went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Liverpool moved seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as Luis Díaz ended his goal drought to spark a tense 2-1 win against struggling Wolves.
<br>
<br/>
Arne Slot's side got back on track after an unexpectedly poor week thanks to Díaz's first goal in 2025 and yet another Mohamed Salah strike.
<br/>
<br/>
Díaz opened the scoring early in the first half at Anfield as the Colombian forward finally scored for the 13th time this term after 10 games without a goal.
<br/>
<br/>
While Díaz has struggled to find the net, Salah is in red-hot form and his penalty before the interval took the Egypt star to 28 goals in all competitions this season.
<br/>
<br/>
Matheus Cunha netted in the second half for fourth-bottom Wolves, but although Liverpool looked tired in a disjointed, nervous, climax, they held on for a valuable victory.
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool had gone two games without a win – an embarrassing FA Cup fourth round loss at second tier Plymouth last weekend and the stormy 2-2 draw at Everton on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
Arsenal's 2-0 win at Leicester on Saturday had applied a little more pressure on Liverpool.
<br/>
<br/>
The Reds responded to Arsenal's challenge as they moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English title.
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool, who last won the Premier League in 2020, will be within touching distance of the crown if they take maximum points from trips to Aston Villa and Manchester City before hosting Newcastle over the course of the next 10 days.
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool boss Slot was in the dug-out despite being charged with abusive behaviour after angrily approaching referee Michael Oliver on the pitch following the Merseyside derby.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot was furious that James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equaliser was not disallowed because of a possible push by Toffees striker Beto on Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot had urged Liverpool to use their "anger" from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.
<br/>
<br/>
They didn't have to wait long to light the fuse as Díaz bagged his first league goal at Anfield since September.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Tottenham won the battle of the Premier League's underachievers 1-0 to inflict another dismal result on Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.
<br/>
<br/>
James Maddison scored the only goal on 13 minutes as Spurs moved above United in the table into 12th thanks to a third win over the Red Devils this season.
<br/>
<br/>
Victory eased the pressure on under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou after exiting both domestic cup competitions this month to go with their lowly league position.
<br/>
<br/>
United now find themselves down in 15th, but do enjoy a 12-point cushion over the bottom three.
<br/>
<br/>
"The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me," said Amorim, who has won just four of 14 Premier League games since taking charge in November.
<br/>
<br/>
"I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about," he added. "I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games."
<br/>
<br/>
Tottenham's first home league win since November came amid a spirit of revolt among their support.
<br/>
<br/>
Before kick-off and after the match Spurs fans again vented their frustration towards owners ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy.
<br/>
<br/>
A huge banner read "24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy – time for change" as a sizeable contingent of the home crowd joined a protest calling for Levy to go.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the mood for Postecoglou was lifted even before kick-off as he was able to welcome back a host of first-team regulars who have been sidelined by injury. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca became the 10th youngest champion in ATP Tour history when he swept past home hope Francisco Cerundolo in the final of the Argentina Open.
<br>
<br/>
The 18-year-old, ranked 99 in the world and playing in his first tour-level final, came through 6-4, 7-6 (7/1) against his 28th-ranked opponent.
<br/>
<br/>
Fonseca twice unsuccessfully served for the match but regrouped to claim victory in the tie-break in a frenzied atmosphere in Buenos Aires.
<br/>
<br/>
The 2024 ATP NextGen champion is the youngest male player from South America to win a tour title while his victory will also see him rise to 68 when the new rankings are released on Monday.
<br/>
<br/>
"Unbelievable week, even in Argentina there are some Brazilians cheering for me," Fonseca said on court.
<br/>
<br/>
"That's just amazing. Every Brazilian, everyone from their country wants this support from your own country. For me, this moment that I'm living is just unbelievable," he added. "Of course I want to be number one, of course I want to win Slams, titles, but my dream is just to play tennis, and I'm living it."
<br/>
<br/>
Cerundolo, seeking his fourth career title, was broken in the seventh game of the first set and fought off Fonseca when the teenager served for the trophy at 5-4 and 6-5 in the second.
<br/>
<br/>
However, the Brazilian impressively held his nerve in the tie-break and celebrated his triumph by collapsing in joy on the dusty, clay surface.
<br/>
<br/>
Fonseca made his maiden final the hard way – in Friday's quarter-finals he saved two match points to defeat Mariano Navone in a match six minutes shy of three hours.
<br/>
<br/>
In all, he defeated four Argentinian players on the road to the trophy.
<br/>
<br/>
He had already announced himself on the scene in January when he came through qualifying at the Australian Open and defeated top 10 player Andrey Rublev in the first round. (AFP)

Shaq's OGs won the first All-Star mini-tournament in NBA history, getting 15 points from Tatum and 12 from Stephen Curry to beat Chuck's Global Stars 41-25 in the final.
<br>
<br/>
It was over early, as the Global Stars started the title game 0 for 10 from the field, 0 for 6 from 3-point range and fell into a quick 11-0 hole.
<br/>
<br/>
Victor Wembanyama – the first-time All-Star who vowed that he would play hard, and did – led the Global Stars with 11 points in the final.
<br/>
<br/>
It was the debut of the All-Star mini-tournament format – four teams, three games, with only 40 points needed to end each contest.
<br/>
<br/>
The league went to the tournament format of untimed, short games with hopes that asking All-Stars to play fewer minutes would lead to better competition.
<br/>
<br/>
Last year’s game in Indianapolis had a 211-186 final score, setting a slew of records but prompting the league to take action after years of urging players to take the exhibition a bit more seriously.
<br/>
<br/>
The first two-shot foul of the night came early in the title game, with Nikola Jokic missing both shots.
<br/>
<br/>
Team Shaq's win came on the heels of Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James' annoucement of his withdrawal from the game prior to tip-off, citing a nagging ankle and foot injury.
<br/>
<br/>
"You will not see anything from me tonight," James, 40, said. "Unfortunately I will not be in uniform tonight."
<br/>
<br/>
"Still dealing with ankle and foot discomfort, so I will not be playing tonight, unfortunately," he added. "You know I hate that. But I'm looking forward to seeing the format." (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Novak Djokovic has urged tennis authorities to overhaul the sport's anti-doping system, pointing to "inconsistencies" in cases involving top stars Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek and those of lower-ranked players.
<br>
<br/>
World number one Sinner agreed to a three-month ban on Saturday, admitting "partial responsibility" for mistakes by his team which led to him twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
<br/>
<br/>
Sinner was facing a potential ban of two years after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against his initial exoneration by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), announced in August.
<br/>
<br/>
In a surprising move, WADA withdrew its appeal and came to an agreement with Sinner to accept a three-month ban.
<br/>
<br/>
In another high-profile case last year, five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek accepted a one-month ban after testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine.
<br/>
<br/>
"There's a majority of the players that I've talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled," said Djokovic.
<br/>
<br/>
"A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It seems like, it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers."
<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, the recently retired Simona Halep, a former world number one, was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after testing positive for the blood-boosting drug roxadustat.
<br/>
<br/>
She argued it was the result of a tainted supplement and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which reduced her suspension to nine months.
<br/>
<br/>
"Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have gotten the ban for years," said Djokovic. "There is so much inconsistencies between the cases."
<br/>
<br/>
Djokovic, who is returning to action this week at the Qatar Open for the first time since retiring injured from last month's Australian Open semi-finals, believes a change is needed.
<br/>
<br/>
"Right now it's a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn't work for anti-doping, it's obvious," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"I hope that in the next period of the near future that the governing bodies are going to come together, of our tours and the tennis ecosystem, and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes," he added. "It's inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair."
<br/>
<br/>
"If you are going to treat every case individually or independently, which is what's happening, then there's no consistency, then there is no transparency, and some cases are transparent, some are not," he continued.
<br/>
<br/>
"The problem is that right now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and ITIA, and the whole process." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Snooker legends Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan said they are very excited to play in their first tournament in Hong Kong since becoming SAR residents.
<br>
<br/>
The World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 will be held in the Kai Tak Arena on March 8 and 9.
<br/>
<br/>
World number one Trump is set to face Gary Wilson of England, while O'Sullivan will take on Si Jiahui from China.
<br/>
<br/>
Both Trump and O'Sullivan obtained their Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme last year.
<br/>
<br/>
"For me, it is more motivating to come back here because I feel like now that I'm here, and I feel like the people in Hong Kong can really get behind me and have someone to really support," Trump said.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think when you have somebody that is trying to represent Hong Kong, which I am now. I think the people can kind of see that. I hope that comes off in the way that I'm able to carry myself and give everybody full respect. I hope to make Hong Kong proud and be the first winner of this tournament."
<br/>
<br/>
O'Sullivan, a seven-time World champion, said he is ready and looks forward to play in Hong Kong.
<br/>
<br/>
Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said efforts are underway to make sure the event is being held successfully at the brand new venue.
<br/>
<br/>
"We also hope the spectators will understand if something don't go right on the first day, we guarantee that we will try to our best to fix problems to make sure the tournament will run smoothly."
<br/>
<br/>
Exhibition matches will also take place during the two-day event.
<br/>
<br/>
Hong Kong's top player, Marco Fu, will face off the legendary "Whirlwind" Jimmy White on March 8.
<br/>
<br/>
The SAR's Ng On-yee, meanwhile, takes on world number 1 Mink Nutcharut from Thailand the following day.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Novak Djokovic's comeback came to a crashing halt as he lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 to Matteo Berrettini in the second round of the Qatar Open.
<br>
<br/>
Djokovic, who was seeded third and received a first-round bye, was playing his first match since limping out of his Australian Open semi-final in January.
<br/>
<br/>
But the Serb said that while he was not 100 per cent, fitness was not the issue.
<br/>
<br/>
"I was outplayed by just a better player today," he said. "Yes, I wasn't at my desired level, and it could be that I'm still not moving the way I want to move, but I played without pain, so there is no excuse in that."
<br/>
<br/>
"I think he played a masterclass match to be honest, tactically, and served very well, so just a very deserved win from his side," he added.
<br/>
<br/>
It was only Berrettini's second win this year, and his first over a player in the top 10 since 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
It was also the Italian's first ever win over Djokovic. Their previous encounters included victories for the Serb in the Wimbledon final and Roland Garros quarterfinals, both in 2021.
<br/>
<br/>
"Something I've been looking to do for a long time. I've played against him in the most important tournaments on tour," the 28-year-old Italian said on court after the victory. "I wish I could have won one of those matches."
<br/>
<br/>
Berrettini has struggled with injuries over the last 18 months but won three tournaments after returning to court last year.
<br/>
<br/>
"Really happy with my performance," he said. "Really happy because I enjoyed my time out there, which is the most important thing."
<br/>
<br/>
The first set went with serve but Berrettini took two points off Djokovic's serve to win the tiebreak. The Italian then broke to love in the second game of the second set.
<br/>
<br/>
Djokovic had broken Berrettini 27 times in their four previous encounters but the Italian was comfortable on serve until the final game before finally winning on his second match point.
<br/>
<br/>
"A champion like Novak is always ready to come back," Berrettini said. "You don't have to think about match point. You have to think about the next point."
<br/>
<br/>
Djokovic said that Andy Murray had agreed to continue as his coach "indefinitely" but said that he did not plan to overhaul his style.
<br/>
<br/>
"I am trying to improve my game, like everybody else. But my game is not going to change now drastically," Djokovic said. "My game is what it is, the core is going to be the same."
<br/>
<br/>
"There are more injuries. Things are not the same as 10 years ago, 15 years ago. I still try to take care of my body on a daily basis, and it's more challenging now, no doubt. I still try to do my very best, given the circumstances."
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Alex de Minaur celebrated his birthday by beating Russian Roman Safiullin 6-1, 7-5, even though the Australian did not enjoy the weather.
<br/>
<br/>
"They're tough days, these ones," said De Minaur. "It's cold, it's windy, you probably don't want to get out of bed. But once you step on court, you have to do everything you can to win."
<br/>
<br/>
"Whether it's ugly or pretty tennis, you just put the ball in the court, and that's what I did today," he continued.
<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, world number six Daniil Medvedev eliminated compatriot and defending champion Karen Khachanov 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
<br/>
<br/>
Medvedev has not won a tournament since the Rome Masters in spring 2023. He was knocked out in the second round of this year's Australian Open by teenage American Learner Tien.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Bayern Munich secured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 94th minute strike by Alphonso Davies to secure a 1-1 draw on the night and a 3-2 aggregate win.
<br>
<br/>
Bayern will face either their fellow German rivals Bayer Leverkusen or Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
<br/>
<br/>
Celtic had led 1-0 since the 63rd minute and the Scottish side had been on the verge of taking the German giants to extra time and pulling off their first ever win in Germany.
<br/>
<br/>
But with Harry Kane off injured and time running out, Davies stepped up as Bayern's saviour, tapping in after Celtic keeper Kasper Schmeichel had kept out Leon Goretzka's header.
<br/>
<br/>
Bayern went into this game 2-1 up from last week's first leg at Celtic Park and seeking to stretch their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions.
<br/>
<br/>
Bayern dominated possession in the first half but Celtic were more dangerous with at least three clear cut chances to score before the break.
<br/>
<br/>
Former Bayern Munich second-team player, Nicolas Kuehn beat Manuel Neuer but Raphael Guerreiro cleared off the line.
<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, Alistair Johnston flashed a dangerous ball across the Bayern goal. With Neuer stranded the ball flew just beyond Daizen Maeda.
<br/>
<br/>
Then Maeda missed a golden opportunity to put Celtic ahead. When Dayot Upamecano was forced into a stray pass, Kuehn led the surge forward and fed Maeda, who blazed over with Kuehn and Jota in support.
<br/>
<br/>
Bayern dominated the ball on a freezing night but suffered with a lack of quality in attack.
<br/>
<br/>
Serge Gnabry was wasteful while Kane sometimes cut an isolated figure, starved of service. The England captain's best chance saw him rattling the bar with a snapshot after Josip Stanisic picked him out from the right.
<br/>
<br/>
That would be Kane's final action. The striker was withdrawn at half time, feeling the effects of an injury picked up against Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
Bayern upped the pressure after the break and fashioned a clear chance when Goretzka went clean through. Schmeichel, however, made a crucial stop to keep Celtic in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, Celtic were in front. Maeda seized on a loose pass by Josip Stanisic and helped it on toward Kuehn. Min-Jae Kim reached the ball first but could not clear and Kuehn was able to take a touch and find the bottom corner.
<br/>
<br/>
It was a goal that shocked the Allianz Arena and threatened Bayern's record of 20 European home games unbeaten. Celtic were delivering on coach Brendan Rodgers' pre-match battle cry to show bravery.
<br/>
<br/>
Bayern sought an equaliser but Vincent Kompany's side were reduced to long-range shots, with Schmeichel pulling off saves from Joshua Kimmich, Michael Olise and substitute Leroy Sane.
<br/>
<br/>
Celtic were moments away from inflicting Bayern's first defeat by a Scottish team and taking the tie into extra-time but the game had a sting in the tail. Olise delivered a pinpoint cross that was met by Goretzka.
<br/>
<br/>
Schmeichel saved but Davies scrambled the rebound home off his shin to send Bayern through to the last 16. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Emma Raducanu was targeted by "a man who exhibited fixated behaviour" during the WTA 1000 tournament in Dubai, tennis officials said on Wednesday, after the former US Open champion was reduced to tears on court.
<br>
<br/>
The 22-year-old Briton was down 2-0 in the first set against Karolina Muchova on Tuesday when she approached the umpire, then briefly took refuge behind the umpire's chair.
<br/>
<br/>
Muchova went over to see what was wrong before the 2021 New York champion Raducanu reappeared, wiping away tears with her towel.
<br/>
<br/>
The Women's Tennis Association said it would ban the man after what it called "the security incident in Dubai."
<br/>
<br/>
"On Monday, February 17, Emma Raducanu was approached in a public area by a man who exhibited fixated behaviour," a statement said.
<br/>
<br/>
"This same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma's match on Tuesday at the Dubai Duty-Free Tennis Championships and subsequently ejected.
<br/>
<br/>
"He will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment."
<br/>
<br/>
In 2022, a London court issued a five-year restraining order against a man who stalked the British tennis star, including making several visits to her home.
<br/>
<br/>
The WTA said in its statement that it "is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support."
<br/>
<br/>
It added: "We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players."
<br/>
<br/>
The Czech Republic's Muchova won the second-round match 7-6 (8/6), 6-4. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Manchester United paid a total of £14.5 million (US$18.3 million) to sack manager Erik ten Hag, sporting director Dan Ashworth and other members of their football staff, according to the fallen English giants' latest accounts published on Wednesday.
<br>
<br/>
United, the 20-time champions of England, are currently a lowly 15th in the Premier League table following Sunday's 1-0 loss at Tottenham, with only West Ham and Wolves between them and the relegation zone.
<br/>
<br/>
The hope for a 'bounce' in results under new manager Ruben Amorim has failed to materialise since the Portuguese boss replaced Ten Hag, who was sacked in October just 116 days after United triggered a clause to extend the Dutchman's contract until 2026.
<br/>
<br/>
A costly decision taken by minority owner Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS group was compounded by the rapid exit from Old Trafford of Ashworth, who arrived from Newcastle on July 1 following lengthy talks only to leave on December 8.
<br/>
<br/>
The financial expense of those decisions was laid bare in United's results for the quarter ending December 31 under 'exceptional items'.
<br/>
<br/>
"Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £14.5 million," said a United press release.
<br/>
<br/>
"This relates to costs associated with the departure of former men's first team manager Erik ten Hag and various members of football staff."
<br/>
<br/>
United confirmed in their first quarter results that the pay-off to Ten Hag and his staff was worth £10.4 million, indicating Ashworth's departure cost some £4.1 million. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Liverpool's Premier League title charge was slowed by Aston Villa after a pulsating 2-2 draw left neither side satisfied.
<br>
<br/>
Arne Slot's men open up an eight-point lead at the top of the table over second-placed Arsenal, but the Gunners now have a game in hand over the Reds.
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool led through Mohamed Salah but were also forced to come from behind after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins swung momentum in Villa's favour.
<br/>
<br/>
Trent Alexander-Arnold's deflected shot secured a point for the visitors, but it should have been more as substitute Darwin Núñez missed a glorious chance to snatch victory.
<br/>
<br/>
"You can understand there is one person in the dressing room who feels quite down," said Slot on Núñez's late miss.
<br/>
<br/>
"If you watch the game back we created far more chances than them, we did everything we needed to do. The only thing that wasn't perfect was conceding from a set-piece."
<br/>
<br/>
Villa, though, could also have won it in stoppage time as Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen went close.
<br/>
<br/>
A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth.
<br/>
<br/>
"A draw I think is fair for both teams because they had also chances to score," said Villa boss Unai Emery.
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool are now 22 Premier League games unbeaten, but a second 2-2 draw in eight days offers Arsenal hope in the title race, especially as Slot's side visit Manchester City on Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
"We're happy where we are," added Slot. "A bit too much now we played games where we deserve more than we got. "We want to achieve something together this season and we have all the ingredients for it but still 12 games to go."
<br/>
<br/>
Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were handed their first Villa starts by Unai Emery as he reacted to a disappointing 1-1 draw against 10-man Ipswich on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
Rashford nearly had a hand in the opening goal but had strayed offside before his cross was turned into his own net by Virgil van Dijk.
<br/>
<br/>
Villa were masters of their own downfall when the opener did arrive on 29 minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
Andres Garcia's backpass went straight to Diogo Jota, who unselfishly squared for Salah to fire in his 29th goal of the season.
<br/>
<br/>
Villa were level within nine minutes as Liverpool failed to properly clear a free-kick into the box and the ball fell kindly to Tielemans, who produced a classy finish on the volley.
<br/>
<br/>
Jota should have restored the visitors' advantage immediately when be blazed high and wide with just Emi Martínez to beat.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead it was Villa who led at half-time as poor Liverpool defending allowed Watkins a free run to meet Lucas Digne's cross with a header into the far corner.
<br/>
<br/>
Rashford's one big chance to make his mark for his new club arrived just seconds into the second half when he skipped past the onrushing Alisson Becker, but could not beat Ibrahima Konate's towering presence as the French defender headed wide.
<br/>
<br/>
The Liverpool onslaught duly followed to extend Slot's run of never having lost an away Premier League game.
<br/>
<br/>
Jota curled a fine effort from the edge of the box off the bar. Alexander-Arnold was a growing influence on the game when he levelled on the hour mark with the aid of a deflection off Tyrone Mings.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot threw on Luis Díaz and Núñez off the bench in search of a winner and one of his substitutes should have delivered a vital three points.
<br/>
<br/>
Núñez had an open goal to aim at after being picked out by Dominik Szoboszlai but fired over to the disbelief of his manager. Martínez then had to rush off his line to deny Nunez another clear run on goal.
<br/>
<br/>
Villa, though, had the majority of the chances in a frantic finale. Jacob Ramsey's strike was ruled out for offside before Rogers and Malen's powerful drives flew just off target. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Kylian Mbappé struck a brilliant hat-trick for Champions League holders Real Madrid in a 3-1 win over Manchester City, helping Los Blancos reach the last 16 with a 6-3 aggregate victory.
<br>
<br/>
Pep Guardiola's side, shorn of key striker Erling Haaland, suffered a painful early exit without laying a glove on the completely dominant 15-time record winners in the Spanish capital, until Nico González tapped home in stoppage time.
<br/>
<br/>
French superstar Mbappé broke the deadlock with a lob in the fourth minute and netted a fine second after combining with his attacking partners as the English side were sliced open.
<br/>
<br/>
The striker, in sensational form after a slow start to life at Madrid, completed his treble in the second half with a low strike from the edge of the box to reach seven goals in the competition this season in 10 appearances.
<br/>
<br/>
"We wanted to win and go through because for us it was logical that Real Madrid would be in the last 16 of the Champions League," Mbappé said.
<br/>
<br/>
He has scored 28 goals this season, with 18 in his last 18 games across all competitions.
<br/>
<br/>
"I said it before, I didn't come to Real Madrid to play badly," continued Mbappé. "Making my dream come true is one thing, but I want to play well here – mark an era and make history at Real Madrid."
<br/>
<br/>
City, who won the competition in 2023, were a far cry from their best as has been the case for much of their campaign.
<br/>
<br/>
"The best team won, they deserve to be there and we don't," admitted Guardiola. "We had a bad year in the competition – when you finish 22nd in the group, it's because we haven't been good.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's been our worst year," he added. "We've been an incredible team and this year, for many reasons, we have lost that consistency."
<br/>
<br/>
City were dealt bad news before the game with Haaland, who netted twice in the first leg, named on the bench after a suffering a knock at the weekend against Newcastle.
<br/>
<br/>
Carlo Ancelotti's side performed almost flawlessly from the off and took the lead in the opening stages.
<br/>
<br/>
Mbappé shrugged off Ruben Dias and lofted the ball over City goalkeeper Ederson after young centre-back Raul Asencio played him in with a long pass.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's not easy when you concede such an early goal," said Guardiola.
<br/>
<br/>
John Stones limped off for the visitors a few minutes later in another blow for the Premier League champions.
<br/>
<br/>
Mbappé netted his second in the 33rd minute after Madrid's "fantastic four" star players combined. Jude Bellingham fed Vinicius who rolled the ball across for Rodrygo, who nudged it to Mbappé.
<br/>
<br/>
The former Paris Saint-Germain forward slipped inside to leave the flailing Josko Gvardiol sliding in the wrong direction and drilled home at the near post.
<br/>
<br/>
Guardiola had claimed City only had "one percent chance" of beating Madrid and his team played like they believed him.
<br/>
<br/>
Madrid's only blot on their copybook was a booking for Bellingham for fouling England team-mate Phil Foden, leaving him suspended for the last 16 first leg.
<br/>
<br/>
Bellingham, who caused a stir after being sent off for dissent last weekend in La Liga, was assured in midfield but the night belonged to Mbappé.
<br/>
<br/>
The 26-year-old completed his hat-trick just after the hour mark, opening up some space on the edge of the box and firing beyond Ederson as City's defence stood off.
<br/>
<br/>
Mbappé departed to a standing ovation and Madrid fans marvelled at the ease of their team's victory, against an opponent with whom they have shared many close battles in the past decade.
<br/>
<br/>
The visitors pulled a goal back in stoppage time when Omar Marmoush crashed a free-kick against the crossbar and González rolled home the rebound, but it offered scant consolation.
<br/>
<br/>
City have now lost 13 games in their last 26 across all competitions, and face Premier League leaders Liverpool next on Sunday, with a battle to finish in the top four on their hands.
<br/>
<br/>
Next up for Madrid the last 16 is a clash with either city rivals Atletico or German champions Bayer Leverkusen.
<br/>
<br/>
"We played a complete game in attack, defence, possession and transition," said a satisfied Ancelotti. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
The Hong Kong official who heads an office coordinating the upcoming National Games, Yeung Tak-keung, said he expects around 1,000 spectators to attend a handball tournament serving as a test event for the Games this weekend.
<br>
<br/>
The two-day event will take place at the Kai Tak Arena, and comes before the SAR hosts the nationwide sporting tournament with Guangdong and Macau for the first time this autumn.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeung, who's the former sports commissioner, said on Thursday that workers at the Sports Park are ready after a series of trials in recent months.
<br/>
<br/>
He said officials were making final adjustments for the tournament this weekend, such as making sure the changing rooms are fine as well as the lighting for the court.
<br/>
<br/>
"Because for handball, sometimes players need to lob the ball high when they go on a fast break. That means they will look up, so we have to adjust the angle of the lights, and how bright they are," Yeung told RTHK in an interview.
<br/>
<br/>
He noted the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in late March would also be a test event for the National Games.
<br/>
<br/>
But while it is the first time the mega event would take place at Kai Tak, Yeung doesn't expect much of a problem because the SAR has a wealth of experience in hosting it.
<br/>
<br/>
He added the test event for beach volleyball would be held around Easter on the football pitches at Victoria Park, and stalls would be set up nearby to promote Hong Kong culture to spectators.
<br/>
<br/>
But before that, Yeung said officials want to bring something different for the two-day triathlon trial races starting from March 1.
<br/>
<br/>
"In the past, such events would take place along the harbourfront. But this time, besides having the cycling and running there, a segment of the track will be inside the space for events at the Central Harbourfront," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"There will also be stands for the spectators, and other areas for them, so they can be more comfortable, and get a close-up view of the athletes."
<br/>
<br/>
Yeung said officials would also put up a giant screen in Central for a better viewing experience.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Spain's High Court has found former soccer federation boss Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent and fined him over 10,000 euros (US$10,434), the court said on Thursday.
<br>
<br/>
It acquitted him of charges of coercion.
<br/>
<br/>
Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence for Rubiales, 47, in a case that caused heated debate in Spain about sexism in women's football and wider Spanish society.
<br/>
<br/>
The court said in a statement it had also acquitted Rubiales' three co-defendants who were accused of attempting to coerce Hermoso into saying the kiss, at the 2023 World Cup awards ceremony in Sydney, was consensual.
<br/>
<br/>
The ensuing furore overshadowed Spain's victory in the tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
Rubiales has maintained through this month's trial that Hermoso had consented to be kissed amid the celebrations.
<br/>
<br/>
The ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200-metre radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year.
<br/>
<br/>
The fine was set at 20 euros a day over an 18-month period. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama is expected to miss the rest of the NBA season after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, the team announced.
<br>
<br/>
The Spurs said in a statement that the 21-year-old French player was diagnosed with the blood clot after he returned to San Antonio following last Sunday's All-Star game in San Francisco.
<br/>
<br/>
"Wembanyama is expected to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 regular season," the Spurs said. "The team will provide updates as appropriate."
<br/>
<br/>
The announcement brings a premature end to another outstanding campaign by Wembanyama, who earned Rookie of the Year honours last season after being taken first overall in the NBA draft.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's tough," San Antonio's veteran point guard Chris Paul said of losing Wembanyama, who was averaging 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists and a league-best 3.8 blocks in 46 games for the Spurs this season.
<br/>
<br/>
"Tough more than anything, I think for all of us, knowing how much he means to our team, but more so knowing how much he means to the game and how much he loves to play," he added.
<br/>
<br/>
Other NBA players have dealt with similar health concerns. Chris Bosh, a two-time NBA champion with the Miami heat, was ultimately forced to retire at the age of 32 after repeatedly dealing with blood clots.
<br/>
<br/>
But the Detroit Pistons' Ausar Thompson has returned to play 33 games this season afer he was diagnosed with a blood clot in March of last year. Brandon Ingram, now with the Toronto Raptors, recovered after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his right arm in 2019.
<br/>
<br/>
But it's a big blow for a player who made an immediate impact on arriving in the league and whose influence is only growing in his second season.
<br/>
<br/>
Wembanyama became an All-Star for the first time when he was chosen as a reserve.
<br/>
<br/>
Young Minnesota star Anthony Edwards noted Wembanyama's rise during All-Star weekend when he was asked if he considered himself a candidate for "next face of the league".
<br/>
<br/>
"Not really," Edwards said, "That's what they've got Wemby for."
<br/>
<br/>
The Spurs have reportedly indicated they expect Wembanyama to make a full recovery.
<br/>
<br/>
While the team's announcement didn't rule out the possibility that Wembanyama could be fit for the playoffs, the chances of San Antonio reaching the post-season without him look slim.
<br/>
<br/>
The Spurs are in 12th place in the Western Conference, two spots away from the final play-in berth now held by the Golden State Warriors.
<br/>
<br/>
Even with the arrival of high-scoring guard De'Aaron Fox from Sacramento at the trade deadline, the Spurs will likely suffer without their centrepiece. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
World number three Carlos Alcaraz was sent crashing out of the Qatar Open in the quarter-finals after losing to Jiri Lehecka, as the Spaniard headed for the exit along with second seed Alex de Minaur.
<br>
<br/>
Top seed Alcaraz dropped the first set before recovering to level, and then led by a break in the decider, but world number 25 Lehecka won the final four games for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory.
<br/>
<br/>
Alcaraz entered the clash on a seven-match winning streak following his triumph in Rotterdam earlier this month but ran into trouble against a confident Lehecka, who won his second career title in Brisbane to start the year.
<br/>
<br/>
"Honestly, I don't know what I could have done better," said Alcaraz. "I have to give credit to him as well, because when he was down, especially in the third set, he didn't give up.
<br/>
<br/>
"He was returning pretty well, really aggressively, no mistakes, or almost no mistakes," he continued.
<br/>
<br/>
The 23-year-old Lehecka will play British eighth seed Jack Draper on Friday for a place in the final. The Czech is through to the last four in Doha for the second time.
<br/>
<br/>
"I feel great," said Lehecka. "To win a match like that against a player like this is a super big achievement. I believed in myself and knew I had the level to produce this kind of tennis. I think the most important part was I believed in my game and did not back down."
<br/>
<br/>
Draper battled back to beat Matteo Berrettini 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the last of the quarter-finals.
<br/>
<br/>
Berrettini, a former world number six and Wimbledon runner-up, had knocked out Novak Djokovic in the second round.
<br/>
<br/>
Andrey Rublev converted his eighth match point against De Minaur to take his place in the semi-finals.
<br/>
<br/>
The Russian, a Qatar winner in 2020, had to dig deep to down the Australian 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (10/8).
<br/>
<br/>
Fifth-seeded Rublev let slip a 5-2 lead in the final set as De Minaur scrambled back into contention to force a tiebreak.
<br/>
<br/>
Rublev finally got over the line, the 27-year-old saving a match point himself in a memorable quarter-final clash.
<br/>
<br/>
"When I had my first match point, I played really well," said Rublev. "I did everything amazing and he just played an unreal rally. He made the backhand down the line and I played a good volley.
<br/>
<br/>
"Then he makes a forehand pass down the line. In most of the matches, normally after these points, they win – it's a turning point," he added.
<br/>
<br/>
"I then started to get a bit more tight and more emotional, I was a bit unlucky," he went on to say. Then when I lost my serve, I said 'Okay, whatever, if I'm gonna lose, at least just try to do your best until the end'."
<br/>
<br/>
This was his first win against a top-10 player since August last year.
<br/>
<br/>
Rublev's reward for his fourth semi-final appearance in Qatar is a meeting with Felix Auger-Aliassime.
<br/>
<br/>
The Canadian was leading his quarter-final against Daniil Medvedev 6-3 when the Russian had to retire. (AFP)

Paulo Dybala scored twice as Roma beat Porto to clinch a place in the last 16 of the Europa League, as Ajax clawed through in extra time despite playing a man down for 95 minutes.
<br>
<br/>
Spanish forward Samu Aghehowa gave Porto the lead against Roma after a 1-1 draw in Portugal last week, but two quick-fire goals from Dybala turned the tie in favour of the 2023 runners-up.
<br/>
<br/>
Porto were reduced to 10 men when Canada midfielder Stephen Eustáquio was sent off early in the second half, and Niccolo Pisilli struck what proved to be the crucial third goal for Claudio Ranieri's men.
<br/>
<br/>
Devyne Rensch turned into his own net deep into added time as Roma progressed 4-3 on aggregate.
<br/>
<br/>
"Having a champion like Dybala means a lot. He's extraordinary; he says very little, but he is a leader and always says the right things," Ranieri said.
<br/>
<br/>
Roma will find out whether they play Athletic Bilbao or city rivals Lazio in the next round when the draw for the last 16 is conducted on Friday.
<br/>
<br/>
"We have a huge opportunity in Europe. This competition can give us a lot this year," said Dybala.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, four-time European champions Ajax survived a huge scare against close neighbours Union Saint-Gilloise of Belgium, nearly squandering a 2-0 advantage from a week ago.
<br/>
<br/>
Kevin Mac Allister's header halved the deficit and Promise David tucked away a penalty after Ajax captain Davy Klaassen was dismissed in the 25th minute for a deliberate handball.
<br/>
<br/>
But Kenneth Taylor's spot-kick in extra time was enough to put Ajax through 3-2 on aggregate.
<br/>
<br/>
José Mourinho, a former winner of the competition with Porto and Manchester United, saw his Fenerbahce side go through 5-2 overall after a 2-2 draw away to Anderlecht in a match that was delayed in the first half by crowd trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt overturned a first leg deficit against Dutch side Twente with a dramatic 5-2 win after extra time in the Arctic Circle to progress 6-4 on aggregate.
<br/>
<br/>
The hosts were heading out before striking twice in second-half stoppage time but Twente then levelled the tie and forced extra time with a last-gasp equaliser.
<br/>
<br/>
Sondre Brunstad Fet put Bodo/Glimt back ahead in the 111th minute, with a second own goal of the night from Twente sealing qualification for their opponents.
<br/>
<br/>
Real Sociedad, meanwhile, thrashed Midtjylland 7-3 on aggregate after a 5-2 win in San Sebastian. The Spaniards will take on United or Tottenham in the last 16. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
In an ice hockey grudge match of border rivals fuelled by political tensions, "51st state" Canada defeated the United States 3-2 in overtime on Thursday to win the Four Nations Face-Off final.
<br>
<br/>
Canada's Connor McDavid scored the title-winning goal off a pass from Mitch Marner to deliver Canada the victory after enduring political barbs from US President Donald Trump about being the "51st state."
<br/>
<br/>
"You can't take our country -- and you can't take our game," outgoing Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- dubbed "Governor Trudeau" by Trump -- posted on X moments after the triumph.
<br/>
<br/>
The victory came in the hard-hitting rematch of a bruising round-robin clash Saturday between NHL stars that produced three fights in nine seconds in a 3-1 US triumph -- but Canada won when it mattered most.
<br/>
<br/>
"Just to see the reaction, knowing what it means to us," McDavid, named the player of the game, said when asked the best part about the win.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's not an Olympic gold medal but it means the world to our group. Everybody battled so hard. It was special."
<br/>
<br/>
In the fight for bragging rights ahead of next year's Winter Olympics in Italy, Canada goaltender Jordan Binnington made several great saves early in overtime and 33 in all.
<br/>
<br/>
The tone for a gripping contest was set when microphone-wearing referee Gord Dwyer said, "Let's get ready for an epic battle," just before dropping the puck to start the game, which went off without any brawling.
<br/>
<br/>
A sellout crowd at Boston's TD Garden produced an electric atmosphere for one of the most hotly anticipated hockey games for years, an emotionally charged spectacle intensified by recent political sparring between the two North American neighbours.
<br/>
<br/>
"Intense," US winger Matthew Tkacuk said of the buzz.
<br/>
<br/>
"This feeling is unbelievable. As big a game as I've ever played in in my life."
<br/>
<br/>
US leader Trump ratcheted up the anticipation in a pre-game call to the American squad and social media remarks repeating his desire for Canada to become the USA's "51st state." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Liverpool will take on Paris Saint-Germain in one of the standout ties in the last 16 of this season's Champions League after the teams were paired together in Friday's draw.
<br>
<br/>
Liverpool finished first in the 36-team league phase of the competition to qualify directly for this stage, while PSG had to come through a two-legged play-off tie in which they crushed fellow French side Brest 10-0 on aggregate.
<br/>
<br/>
The first leg will take place at the Parc des Princes in Paris on March 4 or 5, with the return at Anfield a week later.
<br/>
<br/>
The clubs last met in the Champions League in the group stage in 2018/19, when PSG won 2-1 at home after Liverpool triumphed 3-2 in England.
<br/>
<br/>
In another eye-catching tie, reigning champions Real Madrid will play city rivals Atletico Madrid in a repeat of the finals of 2014 and 2016, both of which were won by Los Blancos.
<br/>
<br/>
Bayern Munich will take on German rivals Bayer Leverkusen, while Arsenal face PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan take on Feyenoord, who are fresh from knocking out AC Milan in the play-offs.
<br/>
<br/>
Barcelona will face Benfica, who they defeated 5-4 away in Lisbon in the league phase last month.
<br/>
<br/>
Aston Villa will face Club Brugge, having already lost away to the Belgians in the league phase.
<br/>
<br/>
Last season's beaten finalists Borussia Dortmund will take on French side Lille. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
The Cleveland Cavaliers boosted their NBA-best record with a 142-105 romp past the New York Knicks on Friday, tightening their grip on the Eastern Conference lead with an all-around dominant display.
<br>
<br/>
Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points to lead six Cavs players to score in double figures, connecting on five of seven three-pointers as Cleveland drilled 19 from beyond the arc.
<br/>
<br/>
Cleveland out-scored the Knicks 66-38 in the paint and held a 23-6 edge in fast-break points, pushing their lead to as many as 42 on the way to a sixth straight victory.
<br/>
<br/>
Evan Mobley added 21 points and Jarrett Allen scored 10 before departing in the third quarter with a right hand injury.
<br/>
<br/>
Cleveland guard Darius Garland took a hard fall in the first half, striking his head on the court, but stayed in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Jalen Brunson scored 16 of his 26 points in the first quarter for the Knicks but was held scoreless in the second period as the Cavs roared to a 77-50 halftime lead.
<br/>
<br/>
Karl-Anthony Towns scored 23 points for New York, who are in third place in the East but fell to 0-6 this season against the three teams with the league's best records: Cleveland, Boston and Oklahoma City.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think the biggest thing was just try to set the tone early," Mitchell said, adding that the determination to dominate had nothing to do with the Knicks' first-round playoff win over the Cavs two seasons ago and everything to do with the fact that they could yet meet in this post-season.
<br/>
<br/>
"For us, it's about how do we continue to build and get better," Mitchell said. "So we're trying to measure ourselves, continue to do what we've been doing."
<br/>
<br/>
Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City, stunned by a loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves heading into the All-Star break last week, rebounded with a 130-107 victory over the Utah Jazz.
<br/>
<br/>
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points to lead six Thunder players in double figures. He added eight assists, two rebounds, three blocked shots and a steal in the wire-to-wire win.
<br/>
<br/>
It came down to the wire in Orlando, where Memphis star Ja Morant drove for a layup that tied it at 104-104 with 1:50 remaining and Desmond Bane delivered the decisive free-throw in the Grizzlies' 105-104 victory over the Magic.
<br/>
<br/>
Morant scored 23 points while Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr added 16 apiece for the Grizzlies, with Jackson blocking a potential game-winner by Orlando's Paolo Banchero at the buzzer.
<br/>
<br/>
In Houston, Jalen Green scored 35 points and Alperen Sengun added 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Rockets in a 121-115 victory over Minnesota.
<br/>
<br/>
Anthony Edwards scored 37 points for the Timberwolves, but was held to just three in the fourth quarter as the Rockets, who led by as many as 14 in the first quarter, clamped down defensively to win a game that featured 20 lead changes.
<br/>
<br/>
Kyle Kuzma, acquired by Milwaukee from the Wizards earlier this month, scored 19 points to lead the Bucks to a 104-101 victory over his former team in Washington.
<br/>
<br/>
Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, limited by foul trouble, scored 18 points before fouling out with 3:37 left to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Khris Middleton, who arrived in Washington in the four-team deal that sent Kuzma to Milwaukee, scored 12 points against his former team in his Wizards debut.
<br/>
<br/>
Middleton's three-pointer with 1:01 remaining pulled the Wizards within 102-101.
<br/>
<br/>
But Brook Lopez made a pair of free-throws and blocked a Middleton layup, and Middleton came up empty on a last-gasp three-point attempt.
<br/>
<br/>
The Dallas Mavericks, fuelled by 35 points from Kyrie Irving, beat the New Orleans Pelicans 111-103 for a third straight victory.
<br/>
<br/>
Detroit's Cade Cunningham scored 25 points and handed out 12 assists as the Pistons notched a fifth straight win, 125-110 over the San Antonio Spurs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Athletes participating in a handball test event for the National Games on Saturday said they were happy with the atmosphere and facilities at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
<br>
<br/>
The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena over Saturday and Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
The competing teams are Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau and Hong Kong, China.
<br/>
<br/>
Wang Quan, a handballer from the Jiangsu team, said the arena is comparable to those in Europe.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think this venue is very professional. Since I have played in Europe before, I find that the lighting and flooring here are very similar to those in Europe - basically the same level," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Hong Kong men's handball team captain Freddie Tse said the venue arrangements were first-class, rating them 9 out of 10.
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm very excited and amazed. It's my first time at Hong Kong's home court, and it's rare to hear our own language. You can see that the spectators are our family and friends. Even the people around us – it feels so familiar," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Huang Peijie from the Guangdong handball team, meanwhile, said the atmosphere was excellent and players were eager to compete.
<br/>
<br/>
Some spectators told RTHK they were there to support the SAR team and looked forward to watching the actual Games in person.
<br/>
<br/>
"I play handball myself, that's why I follow this sport closely. I hope more people will get to know this sport. I want to see the Hong Kong team's techniques and learn a move or two," said a spectator.
<br/>
<br/>
In the match between Jiangsu and Guangdong, Jiangsu led by four points at half-time and managed to secure a spot in the final with a 29-23 victory.
<br/>
<br/>
The Hong Kong team, meanwhile, also made the final after beating Macau 33-19.
<br/>
<br/>
The final between Jiangsu and Hong Kong will be staged at the Kai Tak Arena on Sunday afternoon.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Luka Doncic delivered a dominant 32-point performance as the Los Angeles Lakers snapped the Denver Nuggets' nine-game winning streak on Saturday with an impressive 123-100 victory on the road in Colorado.
<br>
<br/>
Doncic, playing only his fourth game for the Lakers since his blockbuster trade from Dallas, was in scintillating form as the Lakers conjured a statement wire-to-wire win over their Western Conference rivals.
<br/>
<br/>
The Slovenian superstar was the standout performer on a night when the Lakers saw four players finish with 20 points or more for the first time this season.
<br/>
<br/>
Doncic finished with 32 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists while LeBron James backed him with 25 points. Austin Reaves added 23 points and Rui Hachimura 21.
<br/>
<br/>
"I'm starting to feel a little bit more like myself, that's why I was smiling the whole game," Doncic said afterward.
<br/>
<br/>
"There's still a lot of room for improvement and this is only my fourth game. Chemistry takes time. But you saw today that things are getting better."
<br/>
<br/>
Doncic had signalled he was in the mood for a stellar performance early in the first quarter, arrowing a couple of superb passes to James and Jaxson Hayes to help the Lakers take an 8-3 lead.
<br/>
<br/>
A sublime three-pointer from Doncic put the Lakers into a 31-18 lead as the visitors remained firmly on top.
<br/>
<br/>
Doncic finished the first quarter with 16 points, four rebounds and three assists and was soon back into the groove in the second quarter.
<br/>
<br/>
A delicate lobbed assist to James for an alley-oop dunk made it 60-52 before Doncic unfurled a 24-foot three-pointer to put the Lakers 11 points up.
<br/>
<br/>
The Nuggets closed the deficit to 63-54 at the half, but the Lakers remained in control for much of the third quarter, taking a nine-point advantage into the final frame.
<br/>
<br/>
The Lakers continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over in the fourth, and Doncic put Los Angeles into a 20-point lead at 117-97 with just over four minutes remaining after another Denver turnover to effectively ice the game.
<br/>
<br/>
The Lakers improved to 34-21 with the win and remain fifth in the West. The Nuggets fell to 37-20 with the defeat. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior has come up just short in the world's most lucrative race, galloping to second in an epic finish against Japan's Forever Young in the US$20 million Saudi Cup in Riyadh.
<br>
<br/>
Romantic Warrior – the highest-earning racehorse of all time – turned up at the Saudi capital for the race in the early hours of Sunday, Hong Kong time, hoping to add to the US$23 million already in the bank.
<br/>
<br/>
The seven-year-old horse led the pack until the final 50 metres of the race, when the Japanese dirt star rallied to surge ahead in a nail-biting finish.
<br/>
<br/>
This marked the first loss for Romantic Warrior since the Turnbull Stakes at Flemington in 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, the Hong Kong-trained horse collected US$3.5 million for finishing second.
<br/>
<br/>
"He was gallant in defeat. We had a great pitch in behind and he got a little bit of kickback, so I thought I'll get him into clear air and he made ground just beautifully. He went through his paces really nicely all the way to the line and I can safely say I wasn't stopping. I did not alter my stride pace at all," said superstar jockey James McDonald.
<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, I'm gutted he got beaten ... but he went down on his sword that's for sure and made one hell of a race out of it."
<br/>
<br/>
Trainer Danny Shum, for his part, called the performance "a good run", noting Romantic Warrior was only beaten by a head.
<br/>
<br/>
"We all did our best. I hope to win every time, but racing is racing. As long as he tries his best and it's a really good race – I think most of the people enjoyed the race," said Shum.
<br/>
<br/>
The champion galloper is set to next tackle the 1,800-metre Group One Dubai Turf in April.

<div class="itemFullText">
Team Hong Kong, China put up a strong fight but fell short against Jiangsu, as they missed out on gold at a men's handball tournament at Kai Tak Arena.
<br>
<br/>
The two-day tournament, featuring Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau, and Hong Kong, wrapped up on Sunday. It also served as a test event for the National Games in November, when the city will host handball and seven other competition events.
<br/>
<br/>
Despite raucous support from the home crowd, the SAR found themselves on the back foot against the onslaught of Jiangsu players.
<br/>
<br/>
Both sides traded goals early on, but the visitors took a 15-9 lead at the half.
<br/>
<br/>
After the break, Team Hong Kong, China ramped up their offensive play, closing the gap to just three at one point. However, their rally fizzled out as Jiangsu came away 28-20 winners.
<br/>
<br/>
In the earlier bronze medal match, Guangdong dominated Macau, China wire to wire. Guangdong jumped to a 20-10 lead at halftime, and pulled away for a final score of 42-20.
<br/>
<br/>
Yeung Tak-keung, the head of Hong Kong's National Games Coordination Office, said more than 2,800 spectators attended the matches.
<br/>
<br/>
He revealed another test event has been scheduled next weekend -- the triathlon at the Central waterfront.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Liverpool took a giant stride towards the Premier League title as a 2-0 win over Manchester City opened up an 11-point lead over Arsenal at the top of the table.
<br>
<br/>
Mohamed Salah was again Liverpool's star performer as he opened the scoring with his 30th goal of the season in all competitions before setting up Dominik Szoboszlai to double the lead before half-time.
<br/>
<br/>
"It is special. Especially when you are in the title race, it is incredible," said Salah after Liverpool's first league win at the Etihad for a decade. "Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title."
<br/>
<br/>
Just days after exiting the Champions League to Real Madrid, this was another sobering defeat for the dethroned English champions, who are now 20 points adrift of the leaders.
<br/>
<br/>
So often during Pep Guardiola's glorious reign, Liverpool have come up just short in English football's great rivalry of recent years.
<br/>
<br/>
However, their time to match Manchester United's record of 20 English top-flight titles now appears just months away in Arne Slot's first season in charge.
<br/>
<br/>
"We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work to maintain this," said Slot. "It is important to understand why we are where we are."
<br/>
<br/>
Arsenal's shock 1-0 home defeat to West Ham on Saturday had eased the pressure on Liverpool, that had built after dropping points in two of their last three games at Everton and Aston Villa.
<br/>
<br/>
A trip to the Etihad has for so long been the stiffest test of all, but City's defensive frailties were easily exposed and they also badly missed the presence of the injured Erling Haaland in attack.
<br/>
<br/>
Liverpool, by contrast, had their talisman fit and firing as Salah took his staggering tally this season to 25 goals and 16 assists in 27 Premier League appearances.
<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian fired the visitors in front on 14 minutes thanks to a brilliantly executed set-piece routine.
<br/>
<br/>
Alexis Mac Allister's corner was flicked by Szoboszlai into Salah's path and his shot deflected off Nathan Ake past the despairing dive of Ederson.
<br/>
<br/>
At the other end, City's own Egyptian international showed his ability to finish, but Omar Marmoush had strayed offside before being played in by Phil Foden.
<br/>
<br/>
City winger Jeremy Doku was skipping past Trent Alexander-Arnold at will, yet the Belgian consistently failed to deliver a telling cross or shot. Salah was not so forgiving as he raced onto a long ball over the top and teed up Szoboszlai to wrong-foot Ederson.
<br/>
<br/>
The final outcome could have been much more humiliating for City had Liverpool had been as accurate on the counter-attack after the break.
<br/>
<br/>
Curtis Jones had a third goal ruled out by a VAR review for offside after Szoboszlai just failed to time his run through the heart of the City defence.
<br/>
<br/>
Ederson was forced into a stunning save from Luis Diaz and only a brilliant last-ditch tackle from Abdukodir Khusanov denied Szoboszlai a second.
<br/>
<br/>
Marmoush scored a hat-trick in last weekend's 4-0 win over Newcastle and remained a lively threat as he flashed another effort across the front of Alisson Becker's goal.
<br/>
<br/>
But City lacked the end product to make nearly 70 percent possession count.
<br/>
<br/>
Despite an eighth league defeat of the season, Guardiola's men remain in fourth and will be confident of securing their place in the Champions League next season with a top-five finish likely to be enough.
<br/>
<br/>
However, after an unprecedented run of four consecutive titles, City look like yesterday's team with Liverpool now champions in waiting. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Drivers are urged to steer clear of certain roads in Central and Wan Chai because of an upcoming triathlon test event.
<br>
<br/>
A total of around 110 athletes from Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland will compete in the men's individual, women's individual and mixed relay events at the Central Harbourfront and Victoria Harbour this weekend, as a part of a test event for the National Games in November.
<br/>
<br/>
The women's and men's individual races are set for 8am and 10:30am on Saturday respectively, while the mixed relay is scheduled for 2pm on Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
Officials said from 10am on Wednesday to 6pm on Sunday, the section of Expo Drive between Legislative Council Road and Expo Drive Central will be temporarily closed.
<br/>
<br/>
Intermittent road closures will be implemented in the Central Harbourfront and Wan Chai North areas from 5am to 8am on Friday, affecting roads such as Lung Wo Road, Yiu Sing Street and Expo Drive.
<br/>
<br/>
Further road closures will take place from 2am to 2pm on Saturday and from 8am to 6pm on Sunday in the same areas.
<br/>
<br/>
Athletes will begin with a swim, followed by cycling before finishing with a run.
<br/>
<br/>
All races will start at the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade. The cycling route will pass Golden Bauhinia Square, while the running course will loop around the Central Harbourfront Promenade, finishing at the Central Harbourfront Event Space.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Rachin Ravindra struck a superb 112 to lead New Zealand into the Champions Trophy semi-finals with a five-wicket win over Bangladesh, as hosts Pakistan were sent crashing out of the tournament.
<br>
<br/>
The result in Rawalpindi also ensured India's semi-final berth in the 50-over tournament as Bangladesh became the other team from Group A to be knocked out.
<br/>
<br/>
Both New Zealand and India have two wins from two matches and will now meet in Dubai on Sunday to decide team one and two from the group.
<br/>
<br/>
"Feels nice to qualify," New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner said after the win. "Knew Bangladesh would be a challenge."
<br/>
<br/>
Pakistan, who won the previous edition of the Champions Trophy in 2017, lost to New Zealand and then India in the first International Cricket Council (ICC) event they are hosting since the 1996 ODI World Cup.
<br/>
<br/>
India refused to tour Pakistan due to political reasons and instead are playing all their matches in Dubai, which will host the final if the Asian giants go the distance.
<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand have been the team to beat in this group after they humbled Pakistan by 60 runs in the tournament opener.
<br/>
<br/>
Coming in as firm favourites in their second match, New Zealand elected to field first and spinner Michael Bracewell returned career-best ODI figures of 4-36 to restrict Bangladesh to 236-9.
<br/>
<br/>
Chasing 237 for victory, New Zealand slipped to 15-2 and 72-3 before Ravindra and fellow left-hander Tom Latham, who made 55, added 129 for the fourth wicket.
<br/>
<br/>
Both were dismissed before the end but New Zealand still achieved the target with 23 balls to spare.
<br/>
<br/>
The Black Caps had a disastrous start when pace bowler Tasking Ahmed bowled first-match centurion Will Young for a duck.
<br/>
<br/>
Bangladesh's new pace sensation Nahid Rana took down Kane Williamson caught behind for five with a delivery bowled at 148.8 kph.
<br/>
<br/>
Ravindra, who returned to the team after recovering from a nasty blow to his forehead in a recent tri-series match against Pakistan, joined Devon Conway to rebuild the innings.
<br/>
<br/>
Conway hit back with a flurry of boundaries and made 30 before Bangladesh checked the surge and Mustafizur Rahman hurried one on to the left-hander who chopped on to his stumps.
<br/>
<br/>
Ravindra stood firm and with fellow left-hander Latham, another centurion in the opener against Pakistan, waded his way through the chase and after reaching his fifty bossed the bowlers.
<br/>
<br/>
He raised his fourth ODI ton with a single off Rana and raised his bat to soak up the applause.
<br/>
<br/>
"He's doing Rachin things I guess," Santner said of his batter who hit a hundred in his ODI World Cup debut in 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
"He loves ICC events – looks like he never left the game," he added. "He wasn't as fluid as he'd have liked but when he gets going he's tough to stop. His partnerships were good too."
<br/>
<br/>
Ravindra's knock was interrupted by an intruder who barged on to the field to hug the batter before being escorted out of the ground by security.
<br/>
<br/>
The young boy, wearing a white shalwar kameez, was carrying a photo of a leader of one of Pakistan's radical religious parties.
<br/>
<br/>
Ravindra finally fell, caught at long-on off leg-spinner Rishad Hossain, and wicketkeeper-batsman Latham's run out added some late drama. But Glenn Phillips, 21 not out, and Bracewell, who hit the winning boundary, sealed the chase.
<br/>
<br/>
Player of the match Bracewell set up victory with key strikes that started with his second delivery to dismiss Tanzid Hasan out for 24 and end a strong start by Bangladesh.
<br/>
<br/>
Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto made 77 and Jaker Ali 45 in an attempt to put up a competitive total but Bracewell kept getting wickets.
<br/>
<br/>
He was ably supported by the New Zealand quicks with rookie Will O'Rourke returning with two wickets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
World MotoGP champion Jorge Martin will miss the first race of the season this weekend in Thailand after sustaining several fractures in a fall, his Aprilia team announced.
<br>
<br/>
The Spaniard, who previously suffered several fractures when he crashed his Aprilia during pre-season testing in Malaysia, has a number of breaks in his left hand and also in his heel.
<br/>
<br/>
He is due to undergo surgery in Barcelona on Tuesday and "will miss the Thailand Grand Prix", the Italian manufacturer said in a statement. "Recovery times will be determined after the surgery."
<br/>
<br/>
The latest injury is unrelated to the Malaysia crash at the start of February when he broke his right hand and foot after being thrown off his Aprilia at turn two of the Sepang circuit, having emerged unscathed from a crash earlier in the day.
<br/>
<br/>
The 27-year-old, who has already undergone successful surgery on his right hand, made the move to Aprilia after winning the 2024 championship for Pramac Ducati.
<br/>
<br/>
Lorenzo Savadori will substitute for the reigning world champion in Thailand. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Galatasaray have accused Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho of making "racist statements" following a 0-0 draw between the bitter Istanbul rivals.
<br>
<br/>
It was not immediately clear what comments Galatasaray were referring to, and the former Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea and Spurs coach Mourinho has not responded publicly to the allegation.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking following their league draw at Galatasaray, the Portuguese coach reportedly said the home bench had been "jumping like monkeys".
<br/>
<br/>
He also reportedly repeated his criticism of Turkish referees.
<br/>
<br/>
The game was refereed by Slovenia's Slavko Vincic, said to have been appointed after a request from both clubs that a foreign official take charge of the high-profile encounter.
<br/>
<br/>
In its statement, Galatasaray said it would launch criminal proceedings against the 62-year-old Mourinho.
<br/>
<br/>
"Since the commencement of his managerial duties in Turkey, Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho has persistently issued derogatory statements directed towards the Turkish people," the club said.
<br/>
<br/>
"Today his discourse has escalated beyond merely immoral comments into unequivocally inhumane rhetoric," it continued.
<br/>
<br/>
"We hereby formally declare our intention to initiate criminal proceedings concerning the racist statements made by Jose Mourinho, and shall accordingly submit official complaints to Uefa and Fifa.
<br/>
<br/>
"Furthermore, we shall diligently observe the stance adopted by Fenerbahce – an institution professing to uphold 'exemplary moral values' – in response to the reprehensible conduct exhibited by their manager."
<br/>
<br/>
There was no immediate comment from Fenerbahce, who are second in the Super Lig six points behind Galatasaray. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Rain washed out the Champions Trophy game between South Africa and two-time winner Australia on Tuesday without a ball being bowled.
<br>
<br/>
The pitch remained under covers at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium throughout the day because of a persistent light drizzle before umpires called off the game shortly after 5 pm local time.
<br/>
<br/>
Both unbeaten teams go into their last Group B game with a chance to qualify for the semi-finals with three points already secured. Australia play against Afghanistan at Lahore on Friday while South Africa meet England at Karachi on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
South Africa and Australia began their campaigns by posting 300-plus scores against Afghanistan and England, respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
Australia, coming into the Champions Trophy without three frontline fast bowlers, made the tournament’s highest-ever chase of 352 on the back of Josh Inglis’ century against England at Lahore.
<br/>
<br/>
South Africa registered an emphatic 107-run win over Afghanistan at Karachi after Ryan Rickelton made his maiden ODI hundred in a strong total of 315-6.
<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand and India have already qualified for the semi-finals after winning both their Group A games against Pakistan and Afghanistan.
<br/>
<br/>
England will take on Afghanistan in a must-win game for both teams to stay in semi-final contention in Lahore on Wednesday. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Chelsea moved into the Premier League's top four with a 4-0 demolition of hapless Southampton, but Aston Villa's hopes of Champions League football next season diminished after a 4-1 defeat at Crystal Palace.
<br>
<br/>
After a run of three consecutive defeats, Chelsea badly needed a response against bottom-of-the-table Saints, who are set for an immediate return to the Championship.
<br/>
<br/>
The Blues duly delivered with three first-half goals through Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto and Levi Colwill for just a third league win 11 games.
<br/>
<br/>
Before kick-off at Stamford Bridge, a small band of Chelsea fans gathered to protest against the club's owners over the club's form and discontent over ticket prices.
<br/>
<br/>
Once the action got underway, it was a much-needed comfortable evening for Enzo Maresca's men which the Italian will hope can restore confidence among his squad.
<br/>
<br/>
Nkunku took his tally for the season to 14 but only three of those have come in the Premier League as he has often had to play reserve to the injured Nicolas Jackson.
<br/>
<br/>
The Frenchman stooped to head in a corner at the back post before teeing up Neto to blast home a second.
<br/>
<br/>
Colwill headed in Neto's free-kick to make the points safe before the break. Marc Cucurella rounded off the scoring with a calm finish from teenager Tyrique George's cross.
<br/>
<br/>
Victory takes Chelsea two points above Manchester City into fourth.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to English clubs' strong performance in European competition this season, a top-five finish is likely to be enough for a place in next season's Champions League.
<br/>
<br/>
Villa had rejuvenated their hopes of a second consecutive season in Europe's elite competition after beating Chelsea on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
But Unai Emery's men have won just one of their last seven league games after a capitulation at Selhurst Park.
<br/>
<br/>
Ismaila Sarr's first-half opener was cancelled out early in the second period by Morgan Rogers.
<br/>
<br/>
Jean-Philippe Mateta quickly restored Palace's advantage before Sarr and Eddie Nketiah maintained the Eagles fine form.

<br/>
<br/>
Wolves remain five points above the bottom three.

<div class="itemFullText">
Atlético Madrid conceded a two-goal lead then fought back from two down in a wild 4-4 draw with Barcelona in a Copa del Rey semi-final first leg thriller.
<br>
<br/>
After Diego Simeone's side scored twice in the opening six minutes through Julián Alvarez and Antoine Griezmann, Barca raced through the gears in a high-octane performance.
<br/>
<br/>
The superb Pedri Gonzalez pulled one back with Pau Cubarsi, Inigo Martinez and Robert Lewandowski going on to score for the Catalan giants.
<br/>
<br/>
Marcos Llorente netted for Atletico before Alexander Sorloth struck in the 93rd minute to leave the tie perfectly poised ahead of the second leg at the Metropolitano stadium on April 2.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's a terrible result when you go 4-2 up," Pedri said. "You have to be more careful, these are things we have to learn."
<br/>
<br/>
"Today we started badly but I'll focus on how the team reacted," he added. "When we got in front we have to be calmer. The second leg will be difficult, but we will go there to try and win."
<br/>
<br/>
Hansi Flick left Barca's top goalscorer Lewandowski out of the starting line-up, with Ferran Torres taking his place in a false nine role.
<br/>
<br/>
Simeone picked a strong side despite his side's extremely tricky fixture list, with this the first of three matches against Barca and a Champions League last 16 tie against Real Madrid on the horizon.
<br/>
<br/>
Atlético took the lead inside the first minute, with Alvarez pouncing at the back post after Griezmann's cross was flicked on.
<br/>
<br/>
Atlético doubled their lead in the sixth minute when Jules Kounde gave the ball away and Alvarez produced a stunning pass to release Griezmann.
<br/>
<br/>
The French forward was being pressured by Alejandro Balde but cleverly worked room for a shot, which Wojciech Szczesny got a hand to but could not keep out.
<br/>
<br/>
After Atletico's opening salvo, Barcelona dominated the rest of the first half.
<br/>
<br/>
Ferran Torres should have levelled for Barcelona after Raphinha sent him through on goal but his shot was week and Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso saved easily.
<br/>
<br/>
The La Liga leaders hit two goals in two minutes to pull back level, with Kounde setting up Pedri for the first before Cubarsi nodded home from a corner.
<br/>
<br/>
Torres spurned another golden chance for Barca's third, rounding Musso but misfiring under pressure from Clement Lenglet, on loan from the Catalans at Atlético. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Liverpool manager Arne Slot will not be on the touchline for Wednesday's home match against Newcastle after he was handed a two-match ban and given a hefty fine for his behaviour in the Merseyside derby.
<br>
<br/>
James Tarkowski's equaliser for Everton deep into stoppage time in the 2-2 draw at Goodison Park on February 12 provoked chaotic scenes.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot and his assistant Sipke Hulshoff were sent off by referee Michael Oliver, along with Liverpool's Curtis Jones and Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure.
<br/>
<br/>
The FA issued a statement on Wednesday saying an independent regulatory commission had sanctioned Everton, Liverpool, Slot and Hulshoff.
<br/>
<br/>
"It was alleged that the Liverpool head coach acted in an improper manner and/or used insulting and/or abusive words and/or behaviour towards both the match referee and an assistant referee after the match had finished," it said.
<br/>
<br/>
"Arne Slot admitted the charge, and the Regulatory Commission imposed a two-match touchline suspension and £70,000 (US$89,000) fine."
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Everton have been fined £65,000 and Liverpool £50,000.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot and Hulshoff were both dismissed after approaching Oliver following the final whistle. Speaking about the incident at a press conference two days later, Slot admitted his emotions had got the better of him and he had "made the wrong decision."
<br/>
<br/>
"I should have acted differently after the game, but it's an emotional sport and sometimes individuals make wrong decisions and that's definitely what I did," the Dutchman said.
<br/>
<br/>
Jones and Doucoure clashed after the Everton player celebrated in front of the Liverpool fans, leading Jones to confront him before players and staff from both sides raced over.
<br/>
<br/>
Slot will be in the stands for Wednesday's game against Newcastle and the ban also covers Liverpool's home fixture against Southampton on March 8.
<br/>
<br/>
The ban is for domestic games only, meaning he will be allowed in the technical area when Liverpool visit Paris Saint-Germain for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on March 5.
<br/>
<br/>
He will also be on the touchline for Liverpool's League Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley on March 16.
<br/>
<br/>
Premier League leaders Liverpool are 11 points clear of second-placed Arsenal at the top of the table and are hot favourites to lift a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title. (AFP)
