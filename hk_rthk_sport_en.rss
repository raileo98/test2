<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers silenced the young guns of Orlando, beating the Magic 106-94 in game seven of their NBA playoffs first-round series Sunday to book a meeting with Eastern Conference top seeds Boston.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was another magisterial performance from Mitchell, who scored 39 points two days after pouring in 50 in the Cavs' game six defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time he had plenty of scoring support from teammates as the Cavs erased an 18-point second-quarter deficit to clinch a series in which the home team won every game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caris LeVert scored 15 points off the bench and Max Strus scored 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter, when the Cavs out-scored the Magic 33-15 to take charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evan Mobley scored 11 points with 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to help Cleveland withstand a 38-point performance from Paolo Banchero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs, with starting center Jarrett Allen sidelined a third straight game with bruised ribs, moved on to the second round a year after a stinging first-round loss to the New York Knicks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Magic pushed their lead to as many as 18 points in the second quarter before the Cavs clawed back to cut the lead to single digits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banchero's layup in the closing seconds of the first half saw Orlando take a 10-point lead into the break, but momentum was on Cleveland's side and they overwhelmed the Magic in the third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mitchell, relentless in the paint, tied it at 64-64 with a floater and LeVert drained a pair of free throws to give the Cavs their first lead since the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs pushed their advantage to 14 points in the final frame, fans chanting "We want the Celtics" as the final minutes ticked off. (AFP)

    Norris wins Miami Grand Prix for maiden F1 win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by over seven seconds with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took over the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing a yellow flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "About time huh?" said Norris, "I knew on Friday that we had the pace...today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off," he added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ireland's Gavin Mullin (left) scores a try during the men's Cup final between Ireland and New Zealand at the HSBC Rugby Sevens Singapore tournament. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751911_1_20240506004950.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand secured double glory at the Singapore Sevens on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's tournaments to signal their Olympic intent with the Paris Games fast approaching.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New Zealand's men held off a determined challenge from Ireland to win 17-14 while their women's team surged to a 31-21 victory over Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand raced into an early 10-0 lead in the men's final with tries by Leroy Carter and Fehi Fineanganofo but Gavin Mullin narrowed the deficit for the Irish just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dylan Collier restored New Zealand's 10-point cushion in the second half but Harry McNulty's response set up a tense finale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks held on for their second series win in a row after their success at Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand forward Tone Ng Shiu said his team were building momentum for the sevens series grand final in Madrid and the Paris Olympics in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We started off slow in the world series this year but now we're just building up to the Olympics, taking it one tournament at a time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two wins in a row -- you've got to be happy with that," added Ng Shiu, who was in the New Zealand side that took the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know there's a bit of pressure to get that gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried two times and we weren't quite there. So hopefully we can embrace the pressure at the next tournament and build for the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina were crowned men's series winners after they recovered from a 10-point deficit to beat South Africa 14-10 in the fifth-place playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Americans won tournaments earlier this season in Cape Town, Perth and Vancouver to top the table with 106 points, two points ahead of the second-placed Irish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain bounced back from a heart-breaking 15-12 extra-time loss to Ireland in the semi-finals to trounce Australia 29-7 in the third-place match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result saw GB leapfrog the United States for eighth place in the league standings and secured their status as a core team in next season's world series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be in that top eight in Madrid secures our programme's funding for another year," said GB captain Robbie Fergusson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means the boys have jobs next year, it means we can have contracts. It means everything," said the Scot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody gave us a hope-in-hell chance this weekend of pushing the USA out of the top eight and taking that spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we had total belief in our group and we did something special this weekend and hopefully we can kickstart a special few months now heading into the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina, Ireland and Great Britain will be joined in the grand final by New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, France and South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, Spain, Samoa and Canada finished outside the top eight and will face four teams from the challenger series in a promotion-relegation event in Madrid to determine next season's core teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's tournament, New Zealand clinched top spot in the standings after a hat-trick of tries by Michaela Blyde helped them to a convincing victory over Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a clash between the top two teams, the Black Ferns trailed 14-5 late in the first half but scored four tries to win their fourth straight tournament after victories in Vancouver, Los Angeles and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France finished third in Singapore and in the standings after a 29-7 victory over Fiji. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans hold a Chinese flag after the men’s finals of the Thomas and Uber Cup badminton tournament in Chengdu. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751910_1_20240506002250.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China completed a Thomas and Uber Cup double on Sunday as both men's and women's teams beat Indonesia to win their respective world team championship finals in Chengdu.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men, who won 3-1, lifted China's first Thomas Cup since they beat Japan in 2018 – and their 11th in all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it meant agony again for 14-time winners Indonesia, who lost their second successive final after falling to India two years ago in Bangkok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's event, Indonesia had earlier been powerless to prevent a flawless China lifting the Uber Cup for a record-extending 16th time with a 3-0 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next most successful women's nation are Japan, who have won the Uber Cup six times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He Bingjiao's 10-21, 21-15, 21-17 victory against Ester Nurumi Tri Wardoyo completed a perfect 24-0 tournament match record for China's women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They regained the title they lost to South Korea two years ago in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the night session, world number two Shi Yuqi got China's men off to a fast start by destroying seventh-ranked Anthony Ginting 21-17, 21-6 in 43 hugely impressive minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pivotal moments came in the first doubles as Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang edged an epic to beat Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto 21-18, 17-21, 21-17 in a 64-minute thriller.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair fought back time and again after trailing 10-4 in the opening game, 6-3 in the second and 8-4 in the third in a gutsy display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number three Jonatan Christie gave Indonesia some hope when he beat sixth-ranked Li Shifeng 21-16, 15-21, 21-17 in 1hr 17min of see-saw action to extend the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Indonesia's chances were snuffed out when He Jiting and Ren Xiangyu ran away with the second doubles 21-11, 21-15 in just 37 minutes to beat Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana and seal the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier the outranked Indonesian women's slim chances had hinged on Gregoria Mariska Tunjung breaking through in the opening singles against Chen Yufei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chen never allowed her opponent into the contest in a comprehensive 21-7, 21-16 win in just 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I didn't feel that comfortable although I have played such matches before," said Chen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still feel stressed, and maybe my opponent was. I always feel pressured in finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have lost to her before. What I did was watch a lot of matches that I'd lost to her. It's not going to help if I only watch matches that I won."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan did not give Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti and Ribka Sugiarto a sniff in a 39-minute doubles demolition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scariest thing is when people think you should win," said Chen Qingchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Things become different when you assume you can win. The only thing we need to do is prepare and be humble."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their 21-11, 21-8 canter set up He for the Cup-winning victory in the second singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the last three years we experienced failures, and I'm happy that we could regain the title," said He. (AFP)

    Liverpool crush Spurs, adding to Villa's misery

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool shattered Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the Premier League's top four with a 4-2 win that left Aston Villa on the brink of Champions League qualification despite their 1-0 defeat at Brighton on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Needing a win at Anfield to close the gap on fourth-placed Villa, Tottenham slumped to a fourth successive loss to leave their Champions League hopes in tatters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa are seven points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have a game in hand but will miss out on the top four if Unai Emery's men win one of their remaining two matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Salah was back in the Liverpool team after being dropped for last weekend's draw at West Ham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp, in the final weeks of his nine-year reign, was celebrating in the 16th minute when Salah notched his 25th goal in all competitions this term with a clinical header from Cody Gakpo's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrew Robertson scored Liverpool's second on the stroke of half-time as the Scotland left-back finished from close-range after Salah's shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was worse to come for woeful Tottenham as Gakpo headed in a 50th-minute cross from Harvey Elliott, who netted the fourth in the 59th minute with a superb curler from 20 yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was little consolation for Tottenham that Richarlison reduced the deficit in the 72nd minute before setting up Son Heung-min's goal five minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Villa win combined with a Tottenham loss would have sealed a Champions League place for Emery's side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Villa were unable to fulfil their part of that equation as Joao Pedro's 87th-minute goal condemned them to a second painful defeat in four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ending Brighton's six-match winless run, Pedro headed in the rebound after Robin Olsen saved his penalty, which had been awarded for Ezri Konsa's foul on Simon Adingra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Stamford Bridge, seventh-placed Chelsea thrashed West Ham 5-0 to keep alive their hopes of European qualification. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Adrian Otaegui shot a superb seven-under-par 65 on Sunday to come from five shots back to win the Volvo China Open and a place in the US PGA Championship in two weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard finished on a 54-hole total of 198, 18-under par, to win the weather-shortened event at Hidden Grace Golf Club in Shenzhen after Saturday's play was cancelled because of dangerous storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave him victory by one stroke from Italy's Guido Migliozzi, who carded a final-round 67.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-round leader Sebastian Soderberg of Sweden, who started five clear of Otaegui, saw the title slip from his grasp with a sorry double-bogey at the 18th when a par would have taken him into a playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished at 16-under par after a 72 alongside England's Paul Waring (69) and Switzerland's Joel Girrbach (67).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was starting five shots back so I just didn't look at the leaderboard, not think about the result. Just play my game," said Otaegui who won his fifth DP World (European) Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Otaegui's victory in the final event of the DP World Tour's Asian Swing secured a berth at the season's second major, the US PGA Championship at Valhalla, beginning on May 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, that's very good news," said Otaegui when informed that he had finished third on the Asian Swing standings -- enough to get him into the next major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing some majors this year was a big goal for me," said the world number 143.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will just be enough time to rest a little bit at home next week and then head to America."

 Saul "Canelo" Alvarez retained his undisputed super-middleweight world title with a convincing unanimous decision over fellow Mexican Jaime Munguia on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez handed Munguia the first defeat in 44 professional bouts, dropping the 27-year-old challenger in the fourth round and inexorably taking control to improve to 61-2-2 in his storied career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges scored it 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112 for Alvarez, who retained his IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO belts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, whose 34 knockouts included victories inside the distance in four of his previous five fights, came out on the attack against the vastly experienced Alvarez, pushing him back with his jab and rattling the champion in the third round with a right to the jaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Alvarez responded in the fourth. After Munguia connected with a pair of solid rights Alvarez followed a left hook with a massive uppercut that sent Munguia to the canvas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth round opened to chants of "Canelo!" ringing in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, where support was evenly divided between the Mexican combatants in a fight coinciding with Mexico's Cinco de Mayo festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Alvarez jab popped Munguia's head back and, in the sixth, an Alvarez left hook had Munguia's knees buckling briefly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a fight billed as a possible changing of the guard, Munguia -- who has honed his aggressive style under the tutelage of longtime Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach -- continued to press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his vaunted power rarely bothered Alvarez, who repeatedly found away past Munguia's guard to land the more damaging blows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know, I take my time," Alvarez said of his measured start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a lot of experience. Jaime Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong. He's smart, but I take my time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have 12 rounds to win the fight, and I did. I did really good and I feel proud about it," added Alvarez, who hasn't posted a knockout since he stopped Caleb Plant in the 11th round in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez said that after a few rounds he could see everything that was coming from Munguia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's strong, but he's a little slow," Alvarez said. "I can see every punch." (AFP)

 Real Madrid won Spain's La Liga title on Saturday with four games to spare after beating Cadiz 3-0 while arch rivals Barcelona lost 4-2 at Girona.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It was a three-way thriller to the wire in the 150th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mystik Dan, ridden by Brian Hernandez, held on late to win a three-way photo finish by just a nose over Sierra Leone and Forever Young to capture the first leg of the Triple Crown on Saturday night in front of 156,710 fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's like a dream come true," Hernandez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sent off at odds of 18-1, Mystik Dan made the turn for home in front and stayed on the rail with Forever Young just to his outside and Sierra Leone on the far outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a gasp from the crowd as the three colts hit the finish line. It took several minutes for the racing stewards to look at the finish line photo and declare Mystik Dan the winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- which is the closest margin you can have in horse racing -- and it was the first nose decision since Grindstone edged out Cavonnier in the 1996 Derby. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland remained in the hunt to win the world rugby sevens series title after they came from behind to beat series leaders Argentina 21-5 in the quarterfinals in Singapore on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South Americans could have been crowned regular season champions with a win at the National Stadium and they took the lead when Tobias Wade opened the scoring late in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Ireland hit back through Jordan Conroy just before half-time and tries after the interval by Terry Kennedy and Billy Davis secured their victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland have not finished higher than third in this season's series and would need to win the Singapore event while hoping Argentina lose to South Africa in the fifth-place play-off in order to clinch the series title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Conroy was delighted with his side's performance in the must-win game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was a very important game. It was the decider for who could possibly win the whole series, so we were really focused and worked hard and we got the result," said the 30-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we had lost, we would have been out of the title race. But now we've put ourselves in a really good position for tomorrow and we will get our teeth sunk in then."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland's semi-final opponents on Sunday will be Great Britain who trounced France 35-7 in their quarterfinal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British were beaten 19-5 by Ireland in their opening pool game in Singapore but battled back to beat Fiji and the United States to secure their place in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other semi-final will feature Australia and New Zealand who came through a pair of hard-fought quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia squandered a 19-point lead against South Africa but came back to win 29-24 in extra time while New Zealand prevailed 19-14 against the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regular season winners of the sevens series will be decided in Singapore with the top eight teams going through to the grand final in Madrid later this month while the bottom four sides will compete in a promotion-relegation event to determine the core teams for next season's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's tournament, series co-leaders New Zealand and Australia remained on course for a showdown in Sunday's final after they maintained their perfect records in Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand topped their pool with emphatic wins against Ireland, Canada and Spain before seeing off Great Britain 24-5 in the quarter-finals while Australia beat Fiji, Great Britain and Brazil in pool play and sealed their place in the last four with a 24-14 win over Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fiji will face New Zealand in the semi-finals after edging Japan 12-10 while France will take on the Australians following a 24-0 trouncing of Canada. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland scored four times as Manchester City thrashed Wolves 5-1 to move within one point of Arsenal after the Premier League leaders beat Bournemouth 3-0 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  City responded to Arsenal's victory just hours earlier with a goal blitz at the Etihad Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's side took the lead in the 12th minute when Rayan Ait-Nouri clattered into Josko Gvardiol, conceding a penalty that Haaland stroked past Jose Sa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland bagged City's second in the 35th minute as he rose highest at the far post to meet Rodri's cross with a majestic header that looped over Sa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deep into first half stoppage-time, Nelson Semedo tripped Haaland to give City another penalty that was drilled home by the Norway striker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hwang Hee-chan got one back for Wolves in the 53rd minute after a mistake by City keeper Ederson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Haaland curled a fine finish into the far corner in the 54th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez's 85th minute finish capped City's sixth consecutive league win, extending their unbeaten run in the competition to 20 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reigning champions, who have a game in hand on Arsenal, will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last three matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They head to Fulham next Saturday before visiting Tottenham on May 14 and hosting West Ham five days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal cruised to a fourth successive victory, with Bukayo Saka's penalty putting them ahead on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard slotted past Bournemouth keeper Mark Travers in the 70th minute before Declan Rice capped a dominant display by blasting home in stoppage-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chasing their first title since 2004, Arsenal's 26th Premier League victory this season equalled the club's top-flight record for a single campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was probably the best first half we've played all season," Gunners boss Mikel Arteta said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were unbelievable. Everything flowing, super composed on the ball. We generated so many chances, we could have gone three, four, five up easily."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal travel to Manchester United in their penultimate game next weekend before hosting Everton on May 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered a huge blow as Newcastle ran riot in a 4-1 win at Turf Moor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vincent Kompany's second bottom side are five points from safety, with only two games left to avoid an immediate return to the Championship after last season's promotion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Callum Wilson put Newcastle ahead with a 19th minute tap-in and Sean Longstaff doubled their advantage in the 35th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Guimaraes made it three in the 40th minute with a powerful strike before Arijanet Muric saved Alexander Isak's 50th minute penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isak made amends five minutes later when he grabbed his 20th league goal this season, making Dara O'Shea's 86th minute header no consolation for bedraggled Burnley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Bramall Lane, fourth bottom Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards survival with a 3-1 win against already-relegated Sheffield United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalo Montiel brought down Ben Brereton Diaz and the Blades forward picked himself up to lash in the 17th minute penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Callum Hudson-Odoi grabbed Forest's equaliser in the 27th minute with a superb strike that curled into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Yates slammed in Forest's second from close-range after 51 minutes and Hudson-Odoi curled home in the 65th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gave the Blades an unwanted record as the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, awaiting the result of their appeal against a four-point deduction for financial breaches, are three points ahead of third bottom Luton, who drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West London rivals Brentford and Fulham shared a dour 0-0 draw. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ipswich returned to the Premier League for the first time in more than two decades after beating Huddersfield 2-0 to secure promotion from the Championship on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Wes Burns and Omari Hutchinson ensured the Tractor Boys became just the fourth side in the Premier League era to go from the third to the top tier via consecutive promotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds needed an Ipswich defeat coupled with victory over Southampton to leap into the top two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Daniel Farke's men lost 2-1 to Saints at Elland Road, meaning he will come up against old club Norwich in the playoff semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich's most famous fan Ed Sheeran, who sponsors the club's shirts, was not in attendance for wild scenes of celebration at Portman Road as fans poured on to the pitch and lit blue flares at full-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Suffolk club, which was sold to American investors for just 40 million pounds (HK$391.96 million), will now pocket at least 200 million pounds in television revenue in the coming years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich's rise was masterminded by boss Kieran McKenna, who has earned rave reviews in his first managerial role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenna failed to make the grade as a Tottenham player due to a hip injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 37-year-old thrived as a youth academy coach with Tottenham and then Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was promoted to help coach United's first-team by Jose Mourinho and retained that role under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford before joining Ipswich in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot, mostly seeing how much it means to everyone, the players, the supporters. To be one of the leaders of that is absolutely massive," McKenna said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a wonderful day, I'm very proud of everyone involved. It's what we've done all year. It's an incredible amount of effort." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The commemorative boxing belt for the fight between Saul ''Canelo'' Alvarez and Jaime Munguia in Mexico City. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751812_1_20240504184541.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undisputed super-middleweight world champion Saul "Canelo" Alvarez and unbeaten Jaime Munguia both made weight Friday for their world boxing title showdown in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez, who will put his four super-middleweight belts on the line on Saturday, weighed in at 166.8 pounds (75.6kg) while fellow Mexican Munguia tipped the sales at 167.4 pounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighters greeted each other with respect on the stage in front of the T-Mobile Arena, where thousands of fans turned out to record the spectacle with their cell phones to the sound of mariachi music.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel really good," Alvarez said. "I feel in my prime. I feel in my best, because I've got no injuries anymore, so I feel my best right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll show you guys on Saturday night. I'm in my best shape -- ever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old champion had surgery on his left hand in 2022 after suffering the second loss of his career, against Dmitry Bivol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then,Alvarez has won three straight decisions but he hasn't added to his tally of knockouts and brings a record of 60-2-2 with 39 knockouts to the bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fight marks Alvarez's first since 2017 against a Mexican opponent, who has drawn plenty of fans himself for the bout coinciding with the Cinco de Mayo holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, who boasts a record of 43-0 with 34 knockouts, vowed to make the most of his opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I'm going to be world champion," said the 27-year-old from Tijuana, who has honed an explosive style under the guidance of trainer Freddie Roach, long-time trainer of Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promoters have hyped the encounter as a potential changing of the boxing guard, with Munguia poised to dethrone an opponent who made his professional debut way back in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unsurprisingly, Alvarez -- and oddsmakers -- see it differently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't care about experiences versus youth, I'm Canelo," Alvarez said this week, predicting a "decisive" victory in defence of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO world titles. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Los Angeles Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham on Friday after two seasons and a 90-74 regular-season record.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We greatly appreciate Darvin's efforts on behalf of the Lakers and recognize the many accomplishments achieved over the past two seasons including last year's remarkable run to the Western Conference finals," general manager Rob Pelinka said in a team-released statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all want to thank Darvin for his dedication and positivity. While this was a difficult decision to make, it is the best course of action following a full review of the season. This organisation will remain unwavering in its commitment to deliver championship-calibre basketball to Lakers fans around the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers finished the regular season with a 47-35 mark, good enough for only an eighth-place finish in the Western Conference. They defeated the New Orleans Pelicans in the play-in round to earn the No 7 seed in the playoffs but were bounced by the Denver Nuggets in the opening round, 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets also defeated the Lakers last season in the conference finals on the way to their first NBA title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All had seemed optimistic in Lakers land when the team roared to the title in the NBA in-season tournament with a 123-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers at Las Vegas on December 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a 3-9 stretch followed, and reports emerged of growing unrest between the players and Ham, 50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers hired Ham on June 3, 2022, to replace Frank Vogel following a 33-49 record in 2021-22, two years removed from winning the NBA championship. It was Ham's first NBA head coaching job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lakers fans chanted "Fire Darvin Ham" in Game 3 of the series with the Nuggets. After the game, All-Star Anthony Davis said the Lakers "don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor" for stretches of games. (Reuters)

 Uefa have agreed to increase squad sizes from 23 to 26 players for the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, European football's governing body said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  International managers had voiced concerns when a return to the pre-Covid-19 23-player limit had been confirmed by Uefa, after it was increased to 26 for Euro 2020 and World Cup 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Uefa Executive Committee has today decided to increase the maximum squad size of the teams participating in the upcoming Uefa Euro 2024 from the original quota of 23 to 26 players," a Uefa statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The increase does not represent an obligation for the participating national associations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participating countries have until June 7 to provide Uefa with a squad list containing a minimum of 23 players and a maximum of 26. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Indiana Pacers powered into the second round of the NBA playoffs on Thursday, thrashing the depleted Milwaukee Bucks 120-98 to win their Eastern Conference series 4-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Unable to close out the Bucks on Tuesday, the Pacers got their uptempo offence flowing again, relentlessly pulling away after trailing by seven points in the opening minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton delivered a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists, but it was reserve guard Obi Toppin leading the Pacers scoring with a career playoff high 21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TJ McConnell added 20 points off the bench along with nine assists and four steals as the Pacers reserves contributed a whopping 50 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud of the perseverance," Haliburton said of Toppin and McConnell. "Obviously neither of them had a really good game last game -- none of us did. We just responded the right way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana led by 12 at halftime, and after the Bucks cut the deficit to seven on a Brook Lopez layup with 1:05 left in the third the Pacers authored an 11-0 scoring run and romped away in the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight-time All-Star Damian Lillard returned from a two-game injury absence and led the Bucks with 28 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lopez and Bobby Portis scored 20 points apiece, but with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by the calf injury suffered late in the regular season the Bucks couldn't find an answer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bucks, who won the title in 2021, lost in the first round for the second straight season after falling to Miami last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers hadn't won a playoff series since 2014, when they reached the Eastern Conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Eastern Conference semi-finals Indiana will take on either the second-seeded New York Knicks or the Philadelphia 76ers, who clashed later Thursday in Philadelphia with the Sixers trying to stave off elimination. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spur's Cristian Romero in action with Chelsea goalscorer Nicolas Jackson. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751602_1_20240503092814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pinpoint headed goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Nicolas Jackson earned Chelsea a 2-0 victory over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Thursday, dealing a blow to Spurs' hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former academy defender Chalobah diverted the ball expertly into the top corner from a Conor Gallagher free kick 35 metres out in the 24th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Chelsea a deserved lead after sustained pressure from the home side with chances for Mykhailo Mudryk, Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke. Spurs defender Micky van de Ven kept his side in the match, with last-ditch tackles in the area and a clearance off the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham's Australian coach Ange Postecoglou looked furious in the dugout throughout the first 45 minutes and his side came out of the second half with greater verve and determination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But efforts by Son Heung-min and Pedro Porro were blocked and saved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senegal's Jackson calmed home nerves against the run of play in the 72nd minute when he was on hand to head home after a free kick from Chelsea top scorer Cole Palmer hit the bar and bounced down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three points, taking them to eighth, were vital for the push by Chelsea, under former Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino, towards a Europa League place after a disappointing season but left Tottenham seven points adrift of the top four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are in a good place," Pochettino said. "We have amazing professionals working on set-pieces. The team really showed in the way we wanted to build this way to play."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described the first half as fantastic. "Then you have to contain and suffer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou took responsibility for the defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like we've lost a bit of belief and conviction in our football and that is on me to change that," he said. "We were nowhere near good enough. That is on me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham have a poor record against their southwest London rivals. They lost the home fixture last November 4-1 and have won only one of their last 10 meetings. (Reuters)

    Sabalenka sets up Swiatek rematch in Madrid Open final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sabalenka had lost three of her last four clashes against Rybakina. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751599_1_20240503092119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Madrid Open champion Aryna Sabalenka produced a brilliant comeback from a set and a break down to beat Elena Rybakina and reach the final on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Belarusian second seed triumphed 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 [7/5] and will face world number one Iga Swiatek on Saturday in a rematch of last year's final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinical Swiatek earlier eased past American Madison Keys with a comfortable 6-1, 6-3 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw third seed Daniil Medvedev retired injured from his quarter-final clash with Jiri Lehecka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka, 25, sealed her victory with a typically powerful serve that Rybakina could not control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big-hitter had lost three of her last four clashes against the 24-year-old but emerged triumphant as they met on clay for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek has a 6-3 record against Sabalenka but in their only match in the Spanish capital, the latter triumphed in three sets a year ago to claim the title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dominant on clay, Swiatek barely put a foot wrong against Keys, making just eight unforced errors in the match to leave the 29-year-old American with virtually no chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Medvedev struggled through to the end of the first set against Lehecka with an apparent upper thigh problem, losing it 6-4 before retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech progressed to his first Masters 1000 semi-final, where he will face Felix Auger Aliassime, who received a walkover after top seed Jannik Sinner withdrew Wednesday with a hip problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taylor Fritz will face Andrey Rublev in the other semi-final on Friday, after the Russian ousted home favourite Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics crushed the Miami Heat 118-84 to complete an emphatic 4-1 series victory Wednesday and book their place in the second round of the NBA playoffs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The postseason top seeds – upset by Miami in last year's Eastern Conference finals – avenged that loss in spectacular fashion with a one-sided wire-to-wire rout at the TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored 25 points apiece to lead Boston, who barely noticed the absence of the injured Kristaps Porzingis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics threw down the gauntlet in the first quarter, racking up a whopping 41 points to open up a commanding 18-point advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They extended that lead to 22 points by half-time, and kept up the pressure in the third quarter to lead 98-66 heading into the final frame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla could afford to rest his frontline players for the fourth with the game effectively won against an injury-hit Miami team missing Jimmy Butler and Jaime Jaquez Jr.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston will now face either the fourth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers or fifth seeds Orlando in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. Cleveland lead that series 3-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics advance into the next series brimming with confidence after ruthlessly taking care of eighth-seeded Miami in five games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White's 25-point haul included five three-pointers while Jayson Tatum added 16 points including 12 rebounds with three assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam Hauser added 17 points off the bench while Jrue Holiday also cracked double figures with 10 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bam Adebayo led Miami's scoring with 23 points, with Tyler Herro finishing with 15 and Caleb Martin 10. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten cricket pitches have completed their journey up the East Coast of the United States from Florida to New York state and are being installed in a new stadium built for next month's T20 World Cup.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "drop in pitches" have been prepared in Florida since December and were recently transported by 20 trailer trucks to the venue in Long Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surfaces, which will soon be used for games including the highly-anticipated clash between cricket giants India and Pakistan, were developed by Australian Damian Hough, curator of the Adelaide Oval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winter conditions in New York meant that the grass needed to be grown in the warmer climate of Florida before being transported and installed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hough said the journey from the base in Boynton Beach, Florida, to Nassau County in New York state, took over 24 hours, with regular stops for checks and hydration of the grass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The temporary 34,000 capacity stadium at Eisenhower Park has already been built with stands and hospitality areas already in place and the outfield has been put in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hough said the surface is likely to be typical of the kind used for T20 matches, where fans expect to see big shots from the batsmen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our ambition is to produce pitches along the lines where they're good quality pitches, minimal spin, minimal seam and ball coming onto the bat and let the players play the shot," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first World Cup game at the venue will feature Sri Lanka v South Africa on June 3 but organisers are planning some test events before then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the material for the stands has been taken from Formula One motor racing and will be dismantled after the end of the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the international standard playing surface will remain in place with the possibility of it being used for local cricket. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Milwaukee pitchers Abner Uribe and Freddy Peralta and Brewers manager Pat Murphy were suspended along with Tampa Bay outfielder Jose Siri by Major League Baseball Wednesday for their roles in a brawl.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uribe was suspended for six games and Peralta for five, with both players launching an appeal to shorten the punishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Rays said Siri would appeal his three-game suspension while Murphy served the first game of his two-game ban on Wednesday, when the Brewers beat the Rays 7-1 in Milwaukee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were ejected from the Brewers' 8-2 victory over the Rays on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With one out in the sixth inning, an errant fastball from Peralta hit Siri – who had homered earlier – in the left thigh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That led to Peralta, and an incensed Murphy being ejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Siri came to the plate in the eighth he hit a ground ball that was tossed to pitcher Abner Uribe covering first base – where the two traded swings that brought players racing from both dugouts. Siri and Uribe were ejected after order was restored.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could tell that something was being said," plate umpire Chris Guccione said. "We tried to get in there to break them up, but it happened so fast that it blew up." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ronnie O'Sullivan's bid to capture a record eighth world snooker title came crashing down on Wednesday when he was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Stuart Bingham.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bingham, the 2015 champion, came through 13-10 and will face Welsh qualifier Jak Jones for a place in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jones stunned former champion Judd Trump 13-9 in his quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a little cry in my dressing room, I was fearing the worst," said Bingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know how I've held myself together."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bingham, who has lost his place in the world's top 16, pulled away from an increasingly agitated O'Sullivan, reeling off the final three frames to seal a nerve-jangling win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm actually really happy to be honest, it's just the way it goes sometimes," O'Sullivan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like I'm actually getting through the ball, which is more important to me at this stage. It's been a worrying couple of years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not the win I'd have liked to have had, but that's snooker. That's the way it goes. Good luck to Stuart." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Niclas Fuellkrug gave Borussia Dortmund a 1-0 home win over Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League semi-final first leg on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seeking a return to the final for the first time since 2013, the 1997 winners were dogged and determined, outmuscling their heavily favoured opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuellkrug, playing in his first Champions League season at the age of 31, collected a lofted pass from centre-back Nico Schlotterbeck in the 36th minute and blasted a low shot into the left corner of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG, led by Kylian Mbappe, hit the post twice in quick succession early in the second-half but could not break through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dortmund, who had already lost and drawn against PSG this season in the group stage, can continue to dream of a return to Wembley 11 years after their last Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the setback, however, PSG will remain confident of overturning the deficit at home next week against a side they thoroughly outclassed at their home venue in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dortmund manager Edin Terzic said pre-match PSG were "built to win the Champions League" since the Qatari takeover a decade ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nowhere was the contrast between the two clubs greater than PSG's global superstar Mbappe, playing in his last season for his hometown club, and journeyman Dortmund striker Fuellkrug, who was playing second-division football this time two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory, along with Tuesday's 2-2 draw between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the other semi-final, guarantees Germany rather than England or France an extra Champions League place for next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That has already secured Dortmund's place in the competition next season (AFP)

    Alcaraz crashes, Sinner hobbles out of Madrid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz exits the Madrid Open at the hands of Andrey Rublev. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751439_1_20240502080854.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz saw his title defence and 14-match winning streak in Madrid come to an end at the hands of Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals on Wednesday while top-seeded Jannik Sinner withdrew from the tournament citing a right hip injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rublev upset home favourite Alcaraz 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 to reach the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz missed the clay-court tournaments in Monte Carlo and Barcelona last month due to a forearm injury and needed a third-set tiebreak to squeeze past last year's finalist Jan-Lennard Struff in the fourth round on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He couldn't hold off an inspired Rublev though, his quest to become the first man to win three consecutive titles in Madrid coming to a crashing halt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner was due to face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-finals on Thursday but revealed he has been battling through a hip issue this week in the Spanish capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My hip has been bothering me this week and has slowly been getting more painful. Taking the advice from the doctors we decided it's best to not play further and make it worse," wrote Sinner in a statement on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner is due to play on home ground at the Italian Open in Rome next week before heading for an assault on the French Open, the season's second major, which starts in Paris on May 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elena Rybakina battled back from 2-5 down in the deciding set and saved two match points to overcome Yulia Putintseva 4-6, 7-6 [7/4], 7-5 and reach the semi-finals of the WTA event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A late-match collapse from Putintseva, who smashed her racquet and left it on court after the match, helped Rybakina advance to her sixth semi-final of the season, where she will face defending champion Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Sabalenka picked up a 10th consecutive victory in Madrid with a 6-1, 6-4 win against 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka is 5-3 lifetime against Rybakina but lost three of their last four meetings, most recently in the Brisbane final in January. Their Madrid semi-final will be their first encounter on clay. (AFP)

    Vinicius on the spot to keep Real-Bayern tie level

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vinicius Jr celebrates after slotting home his winning penalty. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751327_1_20240501085033.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr scored twice, including a late penalty, to snatch a 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich in an entertaining Champions League semi-final, first leg on Tuesday, leaving the tie wide open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Brazilian, who put Real in front after 24 minutes, has now scored in the semi-finals for a third successive season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bayern, with only the Champions League title left to fight for, had scored twice in four minutes early in the second half through a Leroy Sane strike and Harry Kane penalty to turn the game around before Vinicius' spot kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always want to win but we know that this competition is like that, you can't give away balls because teams score the chances they have," Vinicius Jr said. "We have to keep our heads calm, rest until next week and we know that we and the fans are going to leave everything at the Santiago Bernabeu to qualify."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now it's time for a magical night at home to win and secure our place in the final," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Facing each other for a record eighth time at this stage of the competition, it was Bayern who got off to a strong start, racking up half a dozen attempts on goal by the 15th minute with Sane and Kane coming close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real needed only one chance to score though, stunning the home crowd against the run of play when Kroos sliced open the Bayern defence with a through ball and Vinicius Jr chased it down to beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kroos almost added another himself in the 51st but his curled shot was palmed wide by Neuer. Instead, it was Bayern who scored two minutes later with a solo effort and shot from Sane that eluded goalkeeper Andriy Lunin for a deserved equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their comeback was complete in the 57th when Jamal Musiala was brought down in the area by Lucas Vazquez and Kane sent Lunin the wrong way from the spot to put the home side ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real, chasing a 15th European Cup, levelled in the 83rd with Vinicius' penalty, after Rodrygo was felled by a clumsy challenge from Kim Min-jae, to set up a mouth-watering return leg in Madrid next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything we're fighting for is in this competition," said Kane. "We've just got to find a way to get it done. Real Madrid away is going to be tough but we've got to go there with full belief and go for the win."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners will face either Borussia Dortmund or Paris St Germain, who meet in the second semi-final on Wednesday. (Reuters)

    Alcaraz holds off Struff to reach Madrid quarter-final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz of Spain is in action during the 2024 ATP Tour Madrid Open tennis tournament at Caja Magica in Madrid, Spain. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751305_1_20240501024942.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Second seed Carlos Alcaraz extended his Madrid Open winning streak to a record-equalling 14 with a hard-fought victory over familiar foe Jan-Lennard Struff to move into the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of last year's final at the Caja Magica, Alcaraz snapped Struff's six-match winning streak with a 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/4) result to squeeze through to a last-eight clash with seventh seed Andrey Rublev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Jannik Sinner has been dealing with a hip problem but managed to overcome Karen Khachanov 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 to reach his fourth Masters 1000 quarter-final in as many events this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, who missed Monte Carlo and Barcelona with a forearm injury, saved eight out of 10 break points and saw four match points come and go before he completed the two-hour 52-minute win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How much I've missed this! Quarters next," wrote the former world number one on the camera lens after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, who is now 24-0 on Spanish clay since the start of the 2022 season, is bidding to become the first player to win three consecutive Madrid titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After blowing a 2-0 lead in the second set, Alcaraz opened up a 3-1 advantage in the tiebreak, only to lose the next five points and go on to surrender the set to Struff, who came into the tournament on the back of a maiden ATP title run in Munich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A break of serve in the fourth game of the decider gave Alcaraz the score cushion he needed but the two-time Grand Slam champion was broken while serving for the victory from 40-0 up at 5-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Struff saved four match points and the contest fittingly went to a deciding tiebreak. Alcaraz let a 3-0 lead slip, but he got his hands on more match points by landing an inch-perfect lob and he closed on his fifth opportunity of the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This match reminds me of last year's. It was a great fight," said Alcaraz after matching Rafael Nadal's record winning streak in Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was difficult for me to deal with my emotions, to handle difficult moments. Serving for the match, it was really difficult for me to get broken after being 40-0 up, but I'm really happy that at the end it didn't affect me and my mentality and I kept fighting." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Oklahoma City Thunder sealed a 4-0 series sweep of the New Orleans Pelicans to book their place in the NBA playoffs second round on Monday as Boston dominated Miami to move to the brink of the conference semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Western Conference top seeds Oklahoma City finally got the better of New Orleans with a late scoring burst in the fourth quarter to complete a 97-89 road victory in Louisiana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pelicans led by five points with just over eight minutes remaining before Oklahoma City responded with an 18-2 run to close out victory in a hard-fought contest that saw the lead change hands 19 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalen Williams and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 24 points apiece while Chet Holmgren and Josh Giddey each scored 14 and Luguentz Dort 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the Thunder's first playoff series win since 2016 and leaves them facing a Western Conference semi-final against either the Los Angeles Clippers or Dallas Mavericks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Monday, Derrick White scored 38 points as the top-seeded Boston Celtics scored a dominant 102-88 road victory over the Miami Heat to take a commanding 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an enthusiastic 20-point win over Miami in game three on Saturday, Boston picked up where they left off with another emphatic performance over last season's Eastern Conference champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White set the tone for Boston with an electric first quarter display, rattling in 16 points in the opening frame – including four three-pointers – to help the Celtics take a 10-point lead heading into the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston then kept up the pressure with the scoreboard ticking over to open up a 53-36 half-time lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics stretched the lead to 28 points at one stage in the third quarter, and even though Miami rallied in the fourth, narrowing the deficit to 13 points with just over five minutes remaining, Boston's grip on the lead never looked in serious jeopardy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win means the Celtics can clinch their place in the second round, where they will face either Orlando or Cleveland, with a win in game five on Wednesday back in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday's evidence, few would bet against Boston bringing the series to a swift conclusion. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kelce and the Chiefs won their second Super Bowl in a row in February. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751128_1_20240430081139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time Super Bowl champion tight end Travis Kelce, better known to many as singer Taylor Swift's sweetheart, said on Monday he has signed a two-year contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old signed a deal to stay with the Chiefs through 2027 for US$34.25 million and become the NFL's highest-paid tight end, according to multiple reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Back at it again baby," Kelce said in a video posted by the Chiefs on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Feels good to be in KC. I remember coming here 12 years ago, man. It's an honour and a pleasure and I can't wait to get after it these next two years but no better than right now getting fired up for this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just got out on the field with the boys. We're back at it baby. Chiefs forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelce just missed an eighth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season in 2023, catching 93 passes for 984 yards and five touchdowns this past campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I told yall I'll never let him leave!! Congrats my guy! @tkelce," Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 159 career games over 11 NFL seasons, all with the Chiefs, Kelce has caught 907 passes for 11,328 yards and 74 touchdowns
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We signed the greatest tight end ever to a new contract," the Chiefs posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelce has caught an NFL record 165 passes in the playoffs for 1,903 yards and 19 touchdowns for a Chiefs squad that has reached the AFC Championship six consecutive years and the Super Bowl in four of the past five seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chiefs won their second Super Bowl in a row in February and also won the 2020 Super Bowl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift attended many of Kelce's games, often watching alongside his mother, bringing the NFL and Chiefs in particular extra attention from Swift's devoted fan following. (AFP)

    Premier League clubs agree new spending cap - reports
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Defending champions Manchester City reportedly rejected the proposal. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751109_1_20240430043736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs have reportedly agreed in principle to introduce a spending cap to limit the gap in financial muscle between sides at the top and bottom of the English top flight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clubs will be limited to spending a multiple of the amount of money accrued in television rights by the lowest-earning club in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Athletic reported "the anchoring" plan will be capped at five times the amount the lowest earning side receives via the Premier League's broadcast deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures for last season show the bottom club, Southampton, were paid £104 million (US$130 million) in TV money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said that clubs are expected to be assured that any cap would not cause any of them to reduce spending from their present level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan received at least the 14 votes necessary from the 20 clubs to be approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But defending champions Manchester City, Manchester United and Aston Villa are among those to have reportedly rejected the proposal, with Chelsea said to have abstained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved at an annual general meeting in June, the new model will replace the controversial Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR) from the 2025-26 season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton and Nottingham Forest have been docked points this season due to breaches of PSR, which allows clubs to lose only £105 million over a three-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of other clubs are close to crossing that limit, which led to a massive downturn in spending during the January transfer window.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics of a cap on spending believe it could hinder the Premier League's position as the richest and most watched league in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Players' union the Professional Footballers' Association have also opposed "any measure that would place a 'hard' cap on player wages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, those in favour of the plans cite increasing Champions League revenue for the top teams and the spending power of state-backed clubs such as City and Newcastle as justification for limiting spending to maintain a competitive balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier League clubs have already agreed to follow Uefa's new financial fair play regulations from 2025/26 by limiting spending to 85 percent of their total revenue on wages, transfer payments and agents' fees. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Disgraced former Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales denied any financial "irregularities" on Monday after testifying in court in a corruption probe into his time in charge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "What I maintain, and will always maintain, and I am convinced that justice will (demonstrate), is there has never been any money received in an irregular way," Rubiales told reporters after leaving the Madrid court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales, 46, who resigned following global outrage after he forcibly kissed Women's World Cup star Jenni Hermoso on the lips last summer after the final, testified at length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have answered all the questions I was asked, if I have to come here again I will be here, collaborating – I am the one most interested in clearing everything up," said Rubiales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales must appear in court every month and ask permission from the judge before making any trips outside of Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was briefly detained on his return to Spain from the Dominican Republic at the start of April as part of a probe into federation (RFEF) contracts signed since 2018, including one signed by Rubiales to take the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has never been any irregular tender, we have been paid with the utmost excellence and in the pursuit of legality," added Rubiales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On March 20 investigators searched Rubiales' house in the southern city of Granada among 11 locations in the alleged graft scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raids were part of "an investigation linked to presumed crimes linked with corruption in business, fraudulent administration and money laundering," according to judicial sources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Super Cup contracts are worth 40 million euros a year (US$43.3 million) with the deal brokered by Kosmos, a company owned by former Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish Super Cup took place for the first time in Saudi Arabia in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It returned to Spain for a year during the Covid-19 pandemic but the subsequent three editions have returned to the oil-rich Gulf state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Spanish football president Pedro Rocha is also under investigation in the alleged graft case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rocha served as federation vice-president under Rubiales, then replaced him on an interim basis before being elected as chief this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales is also set to go on trial over the non-consensual kiss on Hermoso's lips, which under Spanish law can be classed as sexual assault. (AFP)

    McIlroy and Lowry triumph in PGA New Orleans playoff

    <![CDATA[<img alt="McIlroy and Lowry pose with the Zurich Classic of New Orleans trophy. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750976_1_20240429082014.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry won the PGA Tour's Zurich Classic of New Orleans team event on Sunday after a playoff win over Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The USA-French pairing of Ramey and Martin had started the day of foursomes [alternate shot] seven strokes off the lead but a brilliant nine-under par round of 63 saw them fly to the top of the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left the final groups under some pressure to reach the target of 25-under and only McIlroy and Lowry, who played together on the Irish Olympic team and for Europe in the Ryder Cup, were able to get there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Lowry, the 2019 British Open champion, missed a par putt on the 17th, the Irish pair knew they needed to make birdie on the 18th to get into a playoff by tying the clubhouse leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number two McIlroy blasted his drive down the fairway and after Lowry's approach shot left him some work to do, the Northern Irishman produced a wonderful chip that left Lowry with a straightforward five footer for birdie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramey and Trainer had been off the course for three hours and it perhaps showed on the first playoff hole, the 18th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French-born Trainer drove to just behind a fairway bunker but teammate Ramey's 3-wood was hooked far left and after Trainer's chip was short, Ramey missed his putt from off the green, meaning par was the best they could get.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry's approach shot had ended up in a greenside bunker but McIlroy got it safely on to the green and left Lowry with a chance at birdie and victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry has conceded that he has been struggling on the greens of late and he missed the seven-foot putt, leaving Trainer with a putt to extend the playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trainer missed to hand victory to the Irish pairing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was McIlroy's 25th on the PGA Tour while for Lowry it was his third and his first at a PGA Tour sanctioned event since his British Open triumph at Portrush. (AFP)

    Alcaraz passes 'test of fire', Sabalenka survives

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz in action during his round of 32 match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750975_1_20240429081318.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz passed a "test of fire" to breeze into the Madrid Open last 16 with a straight sets victory over Thiago Seyboth Wild on Sunday, while Aryna Sabalenka staved off teenager Robin Montgomery to progress in three sets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Double defending champion Alcaraz came through 6-3, 6-3 and will face last year's runner-up Jan-Lennard Struff in the next round after another impressive showing before adoring fans on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number three Alcaraz, 20, missed a month prior to Madrid with a forearm issue but returned to crush Alexander Shevchenko in the second round and looks in fine shape ahead of the French Open, the second Grand Slam event of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still wearing a protective sleeve on his right arm, he had far too much for Seyboth Wild, who had ousted 28th seed Lorenzo Musetti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German fourth seed Alexander Zverev, the 2018 and 2021 Madrid champion, made the last 16 with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Canada's Denis Shapovalov.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrey Rublev came back from 5-0 down in a first set tie-break to beat Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 [12/10], 6-4 in a tense affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's world number two Sabalenka scraped past plucky 19-year-old Montgomery 6-1, 6-7 [5/7], 6-4 in a two-and-a-half hour tussle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka broke twice for a 5-1 lead against Montgomery, who steeled herself and battled well in the final game, saving three set points before Sabalenka sealed it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number four Elena Rybakina eased to a 6-1, 6-4 win over Egypt's Mayar Sherif to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mirra Andreeva defeated Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 7-5, 6-1 to return to the last 16 for the second year running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian, who turns 17 on Monday, won 25 points to nine in the second set against the world number seven from the Czech Republic. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 James Harden and Paul George combined for 66 points as the Los Angeles Clippers survived a 31-point Dallas comeback bid on Sunday, leveling their NBA playoff series as New York took a 3-1 lead over Philadelphia behind Jalen Brunson's 47 points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Clippers squared their best-of-seven Western Conference first-round series at 2-2 with a 116-111 triumph in Dallas, but not before the Mavs erased a 31-point deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George scored 26 of his 33 points in the first half to help the Clippers build their big lead despite the injury absence of Kawhi Leonard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harden scored 15 of his 33 in the fourth quarter, when Dallas – led by the star duo of Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic – threatened to match the biggest comeback win in NBA playoff history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irving scored 40 points for Dallas, including a driving layup through traffic with 2:14 to play that gave the Mavs their first lead since the first quarter at 104-103.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic delivered a triple-double of 29 points plus 10 rebounds and 10 assists, but in the waning minutes it was George, Harden and the Clippers who came through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Philadelphia, Brunson broke the New York franchise record for points in a playoff game and added 10 assists as the Knicks pushed reigning NBA Most valuable Player Joel Embiid and the Sixers to the brink of elimination in their Eastern Conference series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OG Anunoby had 16 points and 14 rebounds while putting in an impressive defensive effort against Embiid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart grabbed 17 rebounds but scored only four points as, apart from Brunson, the Knicks struggled offensively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indianapolis, the Indiana Pacers drilled 22 three-pointers in a 126-113 victory over the short-handed Milwaukee Bucks to take a 3-1 series lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner hit a playoff career high of seven three-pointers on the way to 29 points and Tyrese Haliburton added 24 points for the Pacers, who had six players in double figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bucks, with superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by a calf injury, were also without injured Damian Lillard and saw Bobby Portis ejected in the first quarter after a scuffle with Andrew Nembhard after the two tangled under the basket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brook Lopez scored 27 points and Khris Middleton, who tweaked an ankle in the third quarter but stayed in the game, had 25 for the Bucks, who will try to stay alive when they host game five on Tuesday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City overcame relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest 2-0 on Sunday to close to within one point of Premier League leaders Arsenal and keep the destiny of the title race in their own hands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mikel Arteta's team had thrown down the gauntlet earlier in the day, fending off a Tottenham fightback to win 3-2, briefly moving four points clear of City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the champions – chasing an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title – saw off a spirited Forest, with goals from Josko Gvardiol and Erling Haaland in either half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest – fighting for their lives – will rue missed chances, including two clear-cut opportunities for Chris Wood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City remain firm favourites to land yet another league title with four games remaining – one more than Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-placed Liverpool are four points behind City having played a game more and are realistically out of the title picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, last month docked four points for breaches of Premier League financial rules, remain just one point outside the relegation zone with three games to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's City, who came into the match on the back of a 30-match unbeaten run in all competitions, did not have it all their own way at the City ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home team had a chance to take a shock lead in the opening seconds but Neco Williams failed to make clean contact from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest looked dangerous when they came forward, with Nathan Ake forced to stretch to keep the ball off the toes of Callum Hudson-Odoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But City took the lead in the 32nd minute when Gvardiol powered home a Kevin De Bruyne corner at the near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, undaunted, continued to test City but Wood missed a glorious chance to level from close range when found by substitute Gonzalo Montiel, getting his feet in a tangle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guardiola made two changes at half-time, bringing on goalkeeper Stefan Ortega for Ederson, who had a shoulder issue, and introducing Mateo Kovacic for Jeremy Doku.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest were quickly out of the traps but Wood again had a moment to forget after Antony Elanga skipped past Kyle Walker into the penalty box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elanga found the New Zealand international but he scuffed his shot and it was blocked easily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City began to take more control as the second period wore on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland, who has been short of his razor-sharp best in recent weeks, came on for Jack Grealish shortly after the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He eased City's nerves minutes later, latching onto a De Bruyne through ball, evading Murillo before finding the net for his 21st Premier League goal of the season. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal held on for a pulsating 3-2 win over arch rivals Tottenham in the north London derby to keep their grip on top spot in the Premier League on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bidding to stay one step ahead of Manchester City in the title race, Mikel Arteta's side silenced the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with a three-goal blast before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's own goal put Arsenal ahead before Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz netted to leave Arsenal in complete control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristian Romero and Son Heung-min struck for Tottenham after the interval to set up a nervous finish, but Arsenal clung on by their finger tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal sit four points clear of second placed City, who face struggling Nottingham Forest later on Sunday in the first of two games in hand over the Gunners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last five matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Arsenal are doing all they can to make Pep Guardiola's team sweat as they try to make amends for blowing an eight-point lead in last season's title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the despair of a damaging home defeat against Aston Villa and a Champions League quarter-final exit to Bayern Munich, the Gunners have bounced back impressively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aware they have little margin for error with City chasing them, Arteta had called on his players to show their hunger for success and they responded to his challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thrashing old foes Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday was merely the appetiser ahead of the main course Arsenal served up for 3,000 of their jubilant fans packed into one corner of the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal famously won the league twice at Tottenham's old White Hart Lane stadium, in 1971 and 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gunners could not clinch silverware on enemy territory this time, but their fifth win in the last seven north London derbies kept them in the hunt to win the title for the first time in 20 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat was a bitter blow for fifth-placed Tottenham, who are seven points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa with two games in hand to keep alive their fading hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Playing for the first time since a 4-0 defeat at Newcastle 15 days ago, Tottenham should have been fresher than an Arsenal team in action four times over that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sunday's other early kick-off, Bournemouth beat Brighton 3-0 through goals from Marcos Senesi, Enes Unai and Justin Kluivert. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong epee fencer Cedric Ho booked his maiden ticket to the Olympics in dramatic fashion, winning the final qualifying tournament for the Paris Games with victories by a single point in both the semi-final and final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ho, the SAR's top-rated fencer and ranked 52 in the world, defeated Iranian Mohammed Esmaeili 15-14 in the semi-final of the Asia-Oceania zonal qualifiers held in the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old then won the final bout 9-8 against Uzbekistan's Javokhirbek Nurmatov to book his trip to Paris this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR has now qualified for 30 events in the upcoming Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Things didn't go as well for Ho's teammate, sabre fencer Low Ho-tin, whose hope for Paris was dashed after he suffered a 15-6 semi-final defeat at the hands of China's Shen Chenpeng, who went on to win the qualifier.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's fading Premier League title hopes were dealt a near-fatal blow on Saturday as West Ham rescued a draw against Jurgen Klopp's men while Sheffield United dropped through the relegation trap door.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a dramatic day in the top-flight, Aston Villa's top four challenge was dented by a 2-2 draw against Chelsea, whose furious manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed VAR has "damaged the Premier League" after his side had a late goal controversially disallowed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester United's push for Europe was held up by Burnley in a 1-1 stalemate and Everton secured their top-flight status with a 1-0 win at home to Brentford.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp's glittering reign at Anfield appears to be ending on a flat note after they dropped points for the fourth time in five league games at the London Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool would have moved level on points with leaders Arsenal with a victory at West Ham, at least temporarily, but they failed to make the most of their chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gunners are on 77 points, two clear of Liverpool with a game in hand, while defending champions Manchester City have 76 points with two games in hand on the Reds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarrod Bowen put West Ham ahead shortly before half time but Liverpool looked a different side in the second period, equalising through Andy Robertson before an own goal from West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the home side levelled in the 77th minute when Bowen wriggled free down the right and lifted a cross towards Michail Antonio, who headed home to make it 2-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp attempted to play down a touchline spat with Mohamed Salah, who was left out of the starting line-up, but the Egypt forward fanned the flames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's going to be a fire today if I speak," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's City, who play relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest on Sunday, are hot favourites to secure an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title while Arsenal face a tough away day at Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's 5-1 win against basement club Sheffield United strengthened their push for European football next season but sent Chris Wilder's team down to the Championship after just 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anel Ahmedhodzic gave the visitors an early lead at St James' Park but Alexander Isak scored twice as the home side roared back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have not been good enough," Wilder told the BBC. "The league has been too powerful for us right the way through the season."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle remain in seventh place but are just one point behind Manchester United, who conceded a late penalty in a 1-1 draw against Burnley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazilian winger Antony scored his first Premier League goal of the season but Zeki Amdouni levelled from the spot in the 87th minute, giving Burnley hope they can stay up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag said his team, who have a nasty habit of throwing away leads, "gave it away".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourth placed Villa blew a two-goal lead against Chelsea after Marc Cucurella's fourth minute own goal and Morgan Rogers' 42nd minute strike had put the hosts in control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noni Madueke got one back in the 62nd minute and Conor Gallagher curled in the 81st minute equaliser for Chelsea, who felt aggrieved that a stoppage-time Axel Disasi header was disallowed for a foul by Benoit Badiashile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me it has damaged a little bit the Premier League and English football. If we want to be the best league in the world it should be protecting the spectacle and the decision," Pochettino said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The referee is unbelievable and it's ridiculous. It is difficult to accept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa are seven points clear of Tottenham in the race to qualify for the Champions League, but the north Londoners have three games in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Idrissa Gueye scored in the 60th minute at Goodison Park to make it four wins out of five for Sean Dyche's Everton, who are safe despite being docked eight points this season for breaches of Premier League financial rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves deepened Luton's woes with a 2-1 win and Fulham drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The 32-year-old Owen Farrell will join French Top 14 side Racing 92 at the end of the season.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former England captain Owen Farrell will line up for a World XV when it takes on France in Bilbao on June 22, the match organisers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old fly-half has been in international exile since leading England to third place at last year's World Cup in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When this season finishes he will end his time at Saracens which stretches back to 2008 to join French Top 14 side Racing 92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The World XV continues to recruit world-class stars and the latest to confirm his presence in the team is England fly-half Owen Farrell," the organisers wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World XV, which will have former All Blacks coach Ian Foster at the helm, already boasts two of Farrell's former teammates for club and country, Mako Vunipola and his brother Billy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fijian flier Semi Radradra and former France half-backs Maxime Machenaud and Camille Lopez, as well as prop Tevita Tatafu, have also agreed to play for the World XV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The prospect of playing for the World XV is incredibly exciting," said Farrell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will be the first time I will have played for an invitation team such as the World XV and joining up with guys you normally line up against for club or country, such as Semi Radradra, Camille Lopez, Maxime Machenaud, in a less pressurised environment is something I am really looking forward to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am sure the players will want to get out there and play in an entertaining manner and put on an amazing spectacle for the Basque and French people to experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No doubt the French team will also bring their notorious French flair come match day too. It should be an awesome week and match in Bilbao."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The match will act as a warm-up for France, who will be missing players involved in the final four of the Top 14, ahead of their summer tour of South America, where they will play two Tests against Argentina and one against Uruguay. (AFP)

File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750757_1_20240427013512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greece on Friday handed over the Olympic flame of the 2024 Games to Paris organisers in a ceremony at the Athens marble stadium where the competition was revived nearly 130 years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hellenic Olympic Committee chairman Spyros Capralos handed the torch to Paris Olympics chief organiser Tony Estanguet at the Panathenaic Stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Estanguet said the goal for Paris was to organise "spectacular but also more responsible Games, which will contribute towards a more inclusive society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers want to ensure "that the biggest event in the world plays an accelerating role in addressing the crucial questions of our time," said Estanguet, a member of France's Athens 2004 Olympics team who won gold in the slalom canoe event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A duo of French champions, Beijing 2022 ice dance gold medallist Gabriella Papadakis and former swimmer Beatrice Hess, one of the most successful Paralympians in history, carried the flame during the final relay leg into the Panathenaic Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nana Mouskouri, the 89-year-old Greek singer with a worldwide following, performed the anthems of France and Greece at the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending the night at the French embassy in Athens, the flame on Saturday will begin its journey to France on board the 19th-century three-masted barque Belem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the ship will pass from the Corinth Canal -- a feat of 19th century engineering constructed with the contribution of French banks and engineers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belem is set to reach Marseille -- a city founded by ancient Greek colonists around 600 BCE -- on May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 1,000 vessels will accompany its approach to the harbour, local officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French swimmer Florent Manaudou will be the first torch bearer in Marseille. His sister Laure was the second torch bearer in ancient Olympia, where the flame was lit on April 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joel Embiid shoots past New York Knicks forward Precious Achiuwa. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750641_1_20240426110554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid scored 50 points to power the 76ers to a vital 125-114 victory over the New York Knicks on Thursday, the Sixers clawing back a game in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 76ers had dropped the first two games of their best-of-seven first-round series at Madison Square Garden, Embiid defiantly insisting they were the "better team" and would right the ship at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made sure they did, and the Orlando Magic also bounced back in a big way after going 0-2 down against the Cavaliers in Cleveland, routing the Cavs 121-83 to trim their series deficit to one game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid posted a career playoff high, connecting on 13 of 19 shots including five of seven from three-point range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made seven of eight attempts on the way to 18 points in the third quarter, when the Sixers erased a three-point halftime deficit and pushed their lead to 13 going into the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid added eight rebounds, four assists and a blocked shot and was assessed a flagrant foul for pulling Mitchell Robinson to the court by the ankle in the first quarter – moments after Embiid had been sent crashing by Knicks forward OG Anunoby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 39 points and 13 assists. Josh Hart scored 20 points but game two hero Donte DiVincenzo had just five and the 76ers will have a chance to level the series on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Orlando, Paolo Banchero scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds as the Magic clawed back to 2-1 after dropping the first two games of the Eastern Conference series in Cleveland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-point win marked the third-largest margin of victory in a playoff game in Magic history – and their first home playoff win since a 2011 first-round win over Atlanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just wanted to come out and be aggressive," Banchero said. "Going down 3-0 is a lot different than being down 2-1. So [I] knew we had to get this game – and we've got to do it again on Saturday." (AFP)

    Bears draft USC quarterback Williams with No. 1 pick

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Caleb Williams, poses with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750631_1_20240426100142.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chicago Bears drafted quarterback Caleb Williams out of the University of Southern California with the number one overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Five quarterbacks went in the first 10 picks of the draft with no defensive players selected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three of the top draft picks were used to select quarterbacks, with The Washington Commanders choosing Jayden Daniels from Louisiana State University and the New England Patriots opting for North Carolina signal-caller Drake Maye.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bears' choice of Williams was widely expected, with the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner seen as the answer to the franchise's long-running problem at the position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, the Bears traded their quarterback Justin Fields, a first round pick in 2021, to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams began his college career at Oklahoma before switching to USC and in 37 games, with 33 starts, he threw for 9,782 yards and 93 touchdown passes with an additional 27 rushing touchdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bears provided Williams with a wide-receiver with the ninth pick opting for Washington's Rome Odunze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels played a total of 55 games in college football, beginning with Arizona State before joining LSU and in 55 games he threw for 12,750 yards and 89 touchdowns and added 3,307 rushing yards and 34 rushing touchdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Patriots were taking part in the draft without Bill Belichick as their head coach for the first time since 1999 and they will hope Maye can end their search for a quarterback to finally replace Tom Brady.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a quarterback heavy top of the draft, the Atlanta Falcons surprisingly opted for Michael Penix Jr out of Washington with the eighth pick despite recently signing a quarterback in Kirk Cousins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Penix is a highly-rated quarterback but was expected to have fallen down the draft due to concerns over a series of injuries he has suffered including two anterior cruciate ligament knee injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To replace Cousins, the Minnesota Vikings moved up a place in the draft to take Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy with the 10th pick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been speculation that the New York Giants might make a move for a quarterback with their sixth pick but they opted for a wide receiver in Malik Nabers from LSU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Los Angeles Chargers took an offensive tackle in Joe Alt out of Notre Dame and the Tennessee Titans also took a player in that role, drafting Alabama's JC Latham. (AFP)

    Nadal begins Madrid farewell with teen Blanch victory

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nadal celebrates after his round of 128 victory. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750607_1_20240426072136.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal breezed to a straight sets victory over 16-year-old Darwin Blanch to reach the Madrid Open second round on Thursday as he began his farewell appearance in the Spanish capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old said this week he was not fully fit but demolished his American opponent 6-1, 6-0 in one hour and three minutes as he continues his comeback from injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, is expecting 2024 to be his final season in tennis and this his last appearance at the Madrid Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his first competitive appearance since January at the Barcelona Open last week, where he was defeated in the second round by Alex de Minaur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian will be Nadal's second round opponent in Madrid too as the Spaniard tries to find form and fitness ahead of Rome and then the French Open, where he is the record 14-time winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am hoping to do as well as possible and I hope to be competitive against De Minaur," said Nadal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me it has always been a pleasure to play in front of you all... the support I've received here since the first time I played is hard to compare to anywhere else, so I can only say thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal broke in the second game against the overpowered and initially overawed American, ranked 1,028th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanch got on the board in the fourth game but Nadal broke again in the sixth after the youngster drove a forehand into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanch saved two break points at the start of the second set but Nadal converted the third to take further control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The merciless tennis great broke again after an entertaining rally for a 3-0 lead and once more when Blanch went long to make it 5-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal served it out, triumphing on his second match point with a powerful serve that Blanch could not control. (AFP)

 Feyenoord's Arne Slot wants to succeed Juergen Klopp as Liverpool manager, the Dutchman said on Thursday, and he expects his club and the Premier League side to reach an agreement soon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dutch media reported on Wednesday that Liverpool had opened negotiations with the Eredivisie champions for the services of the 45-year-old Slot who is under contract with the Rotterdam club until 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing I can say about it is that the clubs are in negotiations. Then you sit in the waiting room and wait for what will come out," Slot said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It seems clear to me that I would like to go to Liverpool. Now I'm waiting to see whether the clubs reach an agreement. I'm very confident in that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The clubs have to do their job. It will undoubtedly become clear in the coming days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot was heavily linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur last year, but opted to stay at Feyenoord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been widely praised for his innovative, attacking football with Feyenoord, guiding them to the league title in 2022-23 and the KNVB Cup crown on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first season at Feyenoord, Slot led the Rotterdam club to the final of the inaugural Europa Conference League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp announced in January that he would stand down as Liverpool manager at the end of the season after a highly successful nine-year spell at the club in which they won the Champions League, Premier League, Club World Cup, FA Cup, League Cup and Super Cup. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Phil Foden celebrates scoring his first and City's second goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750604_1_20240426064210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Phil Foden struck twice as Manchester City stepped up their bid for a fourth Premier League crown in a row with a ruthless 4-0 victory at Brighton & Hove Albion on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A day after Liverpool's title challenge suffered a huge blow with a 2-0 defeat at Everton, City kept up the pressure on leaders Arsenal with a dominant display that left them one point behind the London club with a game in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne's superb diving header put City, missing top scorer Erling Haaland due to injury, ahead in the 17th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't happen too much, does it? I think the only way I could reach it was jumping to the ball, and it goes in like a little lob, but it's obviously not something I'm really good at," De Bruyne said after netting his first headed goal in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden scored his first with a deflected free kick and Brighton defensive errors allowed Bernardo Silva to win the ball and set up the England midfielder to sweep a shot into the bottom corner before halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden, whose hat-trick led City to a 4-1 win over Aston Villa three weeks ago, became only the third player to score 50 top-flight goals under manager Pep Guardiola aged 23 or younger, after Lionel Messi and Haaland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez completed the rout midway through the second half and Brighton, who remained 11th in the table, never looked capable of launching a fightback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester City are unbeaten in 30 games in all competitions with 24 wins and six draws, making them the third English top-flight side to reach that landmark after Nottingham Forest [40 in 1978] and Manchester United [34 in 1993-94 and 33 in 1998-99].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their last loss excluding penalty shootouts was against Aston Villa in early December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brighton's best chance came when City keeper Ederson gifted them a late opportunity when he raced out of his box, only to fire the ball straight at Odeluga Offiah who failed to take advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "City are one of the best teams in the world and today they played very well," Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi said. (Reuters)

    HK to host Fencing Foil World Cup

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will host a FIE Foil World Cup for the first time next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong leg, at AsiaWorld-Expo, will mark the last Foil World Cup of the season, with up to 400 elite foilists from 30 countries and regions coming to compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them are men's world number one Nick Itkin and women's world number one Lee Kiefer, both from the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition represents an important warm-up opportunity for homegrown Olympians Edgar Cheung and Daphne Chan before they head to Paris for the Olympics. Cheung said he's excited to fence on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot because we use to travel around the world to fence in the World Cup to compete. Now it is a good opportunity that we can fence in Hong Kong, and all the Hong Kong people can cheer for us with Cantonese, which is really touching," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's kind of like a training for me this competition to prepare for the Olympics. If I have any mistakes in physical or mental that I did not do good, I can now realise and I still have time to prepare and to be better, and even my coach can see what happens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicholas Choi, who was part of the team that won bronze at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said it's incredible for Hong Kong to host an international event and for many big names to come to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Back in my days when I was younger, there wasn't a lot of international competitions but now slowly and slowly, there are more and more happening. I think it is really good for the development, for the youngsters, and also for fencing, it's the first time for us in foil that we're actually hosting a World Cup competition, so I think it is a really big step for us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also think that we're also hosting the World Championship in two years. This would be a really good stepping stone for us to even prepare the World Championship in a better way so I think it is a really good thing for us and everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chan said she doesn't want to set specific expectations for herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this World Cup is pretty much the same as the usual ones and it just keeps my condition. There are many competitions to keep me at my best level, so I hope I can perform better on the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everyone in the competition is my competitor, but I just want to try my best, fence them and achieve better results."

    Heat stun Celtics to level playoff series

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750456_1_20240425101427.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat unleashed a barrage of three-pointers to score a series-levelling 111-101 upset over the top-seeded Boston Celtics in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff duel on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eighth seeds Miami, playing without the injured Jimmy Butler, produced a battling performance to knot the best-of-seven-series at 1-1 as the teams head back to Florida for game three on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyler Herro led the Miami scoring with 24 points, part of a balanced offensive effort that saw all five Heat starters post double-digit points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the key to the Miami victory was their accuracy from long-range, with the Heat draining 23 three-pointers from 43 attempts compared to Boston's 12 of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Herro knocked down six threes while Caleb Martin added five in his tally of 21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston, meanwhile, was led by 33 points from Jaylen Brown, with Jayson Tatum finishing with 28 in a losing effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was all the more unexpected given Miami's 20-point drubbing by Boston in game one on Sunday – something Herro said had motivated the Heat for game two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We lost badly in game one and everybody responded tonight, and that's that's all you can ask for from a group of guys," Herro said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another trademark display of defiance from Miami, who are aiming to emulate their playoff run of last season when they reached the NBA Finals after entering the postseason via the play-in tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't even want to mention last year, this year is a whole new year," Herro said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We feel like we have a great group of guys. We're not fully healthy, but we have guys who want to play and want to be out here making a difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This playoff opportunity is big for everybody. We just love to compete." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Kewell's Yokohama F-Marinos set up an Asian Champions League final showdown with Al Ain after beating Ulsan Hyundai 5-4 on penalties to win a pulsating semi-final on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trailing 1-0 from last week's first leg in South Korea, Yokohama scored three goals in the opening 30 minutes of the return fixture in Japan but then conceded twice and had a man sent off before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game finished 3-3 on aggregate after extra time in constant driving rain, before goalkeeper William Popp saved from Ulsan's Kim Min-woo in the shoot-out to hand Yokohama the advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carlos Eduardo converted the decisive spot-kick to send Yokohama, who former Liverpool and Leeds forward Kewell took over as coach at the start of the year, into their first Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ulsan, who had already booked their place in next year's 32-team Club World Cup in the United States by winning the semi-final first leg, were looking for their third Champions League title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama will host Al Ain in the first leg of the final on May 11, with the return being held in the United Arab Emirates on May 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al Ain beat Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 5-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to reach the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama made a blistering start and took the lead in the 13th minute when a defensive mix-up between Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Seok-ho allowed Asahi Uenaka to streak through and score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama looked capable of scoring more and it was little surprise when Anderson Lopes added a second in the 21st minute, firing home a left-foot shot from just inside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home side kept up the pressure and Uenaka notched his second of the game on the half-hour mark when he slipped his marker and curled a shot past goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just as it looked like turning into a rout, Ulsan hit back when Matheus Sales headed home direct from a corner in the 35th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes later, Ulsan had a penalty and Yokohama were reduced to 10 men when Takumi Kamijima was red-carded for a handball as he slid in to make a tackle.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Olympians Cheung, Haughey named SAR's top sports stars" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750412_1_20240424231351.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaden McDaniels scored 25 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves dominated the Phoenix Suns 105-93 to take a 2-0 series lead in the NBA playoffs on Tuesday, while Indiana roared back to beat Milwaukee 125-108 and square their best-of-seven duel at 1-1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McDaniels led a balanced Minnesota offensive effort that saw all five starters finish in double digits as the Western Conference third seeds moved to within two wins of a series victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was the Timberwolves defence who turned the game in the home side's favor, shutting down Phoenix in the second half to frustrate Suns stars Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A torrid night for Phoenix ended with Booker fouling out in the fourth quarter while the Suns also were handed an injury scare, with Grayson Allen hobbling off in the third quarter after rolling an ankle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means Suns coach Frank Vogel will have his work cut out for him when the series heads to Arizona for game three on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves will go into that fixture brimming with confidence after restricting Phoenix's offense to 42 second-half points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota scored 31 points off 20 Phoenix turnovers while the Suns took just two points from the Wolves' 14 turnovers throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Milwaukee, Pascal Siakam poured in 37 points to guide the Pacers to an impressive series-leveling win over the Bucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siakam finished with 11 rebounds and six assists while Myles Turner added 22 and Andrew Nembhard 20 as the Pacers claimed a deserved win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milwaukee started brightly, with Damian Lillard once again taking on the lion's share of the scoring duties in the absence of the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lillard's 34 points were not enough to keep the Pacers at arm's length. Indiana took the lead just before half-time and finally pulled away in the fourth quarter, leading by 23 points at one stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game three in the series takes place in Indianapolis on Friday. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kai Havertz celebrates scoring his first and Arsenal's third goal of the night. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750268_1_20240424074751.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Havertz and Ben White scored twice as Arsenal thrashed Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday to surge ahead in the Premier League title race and up the pressure on Liverpool and Manchester City.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The destiny of the title remains in City's hands as the defending champions have two games in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool have also played one fewer game than Arsenal and are in action at Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men's goal difference advantage now looks unassailable should it become decisive in the title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts flew out of the blocks and were in front inside five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard smashed in his 15th goal of the season at Djordje Petrovic's near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Petrovic redeemed himself for fault at the opening goal with two brilliant saves to turn away Havertz's low effort and a deflected shot by Trossard to keep his side in the game before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the floodgates opened once White curled in Arsenal's second after Chelsea failed to clear a corner on 52 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Odegaard's stunning through ball was then met with the finish it deserved as Havertz smashed high past Petrovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His next finish was more subtle as the German international fired in off the post from Bukayo Saka's pass for his seventh goal in his last 14 club games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A night for forget for Chelsea was summed up by a sitter from Nicolas Jackson when he hit the side-netting with just David Raya to beat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And fortune was also not on Mauricio Pochettino's side when White's attempted cross flew into the top corner from another sensational Odegaard pass. (AFP)

    Feyenoord boss Slot leading race for Liverpool job

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Arne Slot led Feyenoord to their first Eredivisie title in six years last season. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750243_1_20240424011914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord coach Arne Slot has emerged as the leading contender to succeed Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager, according to British media reports on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slot, 45, led Feyenoord to their first league title in six years last season and won the Dutch Cup on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had been a front runner to take over at Tottenham a year ago before ruling himself out of contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky Sports, the BBC and The Times all reported that Slot is now leading the race for the unenviable task of following Klopp at Anfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Reds could face competition from Bayern Munich and Barcelona, who are also looking for new coaches next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite when Klopp announced his decision in January to stand down at the end of the season after nearly nine years in the role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool vacancy but reportedly held talks with West Ham on Monday about replacing David Moyes next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season, but his side trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games remaining in this year's Eredivisie title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said his track record of improving players and a high-octane playing style, not dissimilar to Klopp's, is what is attracting the Liverpool hierarchy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp has just five games left of a reign that has transformed Liverpool's fortunes after decades in the doldrums and could yet go out on the high by winning the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool sit behind Arsenal only on goal difference at the top of the table, but Manchester City have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they are just one point behind the top two with a game in hand. (AFP)

    Knicks rally late to stun Sixers, take 2-0 series lead

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Knicks guard Josh Hart rebounds against 76ers guard Kyle Lowry. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750132_1_20240423121622.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New York Knicks scored eight points in the final 27.4 seconds to stun the Philadelphia 76ers 104-101 on Monday and take a 2-0 lead in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jalen Brunson's three-pointer pulled the Knicks within two points and after Josh Hart came up with a steal, Donte DiVincenzo capped a chaotic possession with a three-pointer – after missing his first attempt – to put New York up 102-101.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OG Anunoby sealed it at an ecstatic Madison Square Garden with a pair of free throws as the Knicks joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in taking a 2-0 lead in their first-round series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs led wire-to-wire in a 96-86 victory over the Orlando Magic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a crushing defeat for the 76ers, who didn't trail until late in the third quarter, when a Brunson layup gave the Knicks a 68-67 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Philadelphia's NBA Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid was clearly hindered late by pain in his surgically repaired left knee, but the Sixers appeared to have regained control when Tyrese Maxey, fed by Embiid, made a three-pointer with 1:09 to play that put the Sixers up 100-96.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyle Lowry added a free throw to give the Sixers a five-point lead with less than a minute to play, but the Knicks responded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson finished with 24 points despite connecting on just eight of 29 shots from the field. He added eight rebounds and six assists and Hart added 21 points and 15 rebounds for New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maxey, who skipped the Sixers' morning shoot-around because of illness, finished with 35 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. Embiid added 34 points and 10 rebounds but missed a three-pointer at the final buzzer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Cleveland, Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points and Jarrett Allen added 16 points and 20 rebounds for the Cavaliers in another dominant win over the Magic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs, eager to expunge the memory of their first-round loss to the Knicks last season, have posted two straight wire-to-wire victories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolo Banchero led Orlando's scoring with 21 points and Franz Wagner added 18. The youthful Magic will be hoping to turn things around when the series shifts to Orlando. (AFP)

    Inter win Serie A in derby thriller with AC Milan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Inter Milan players celebrate winning the club's twentieth Serie A title. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750074_1_20240423081355.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Inter Milan won Serie A on Monday after beating AC Milan 2-1 and creating an unassailable lead at the top of the league with their sixth straight derby victory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Francesco Acerbi and Marcus Thuram gave Inter a 17-point advantage over closest challengers Milan and secured their 20th league crown with five matches of the season remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simone Inzaghi won the first league title of his managerial career on a cold, soaking wet evening at the San Siro where a clutch of Inter's "away" fans in the 75,000 crowd roared in delight at the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milan made a fight of it in the final moments after Fikayo Tomori pulled one back with 10 minutes remaining but Inter held out to kick off a title party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inter have become the second team to win 20 Italian league titles and will have a second star stitched onto their jersey, after Juventus who are way out in the lead with 36 league crowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The future looks bright as Inzaghi, captain Lautaro Martinez and Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella are all set to renew their contracts while smart work in the transfer market and increased revenue has helped mitigate significant financial harm wrought by the Covid-29 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piotr Zielinski and Medhi Taremi will arrive from Napoli and Porto as free agents in the close season while big stars like Marcus Thuram should stay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Off the pitch Inter's president Steven Zhang is trying to make sure that investment fund Oaktree don't take control of the club with non-repayment of an emergency loan – granted in 2021 – next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang is looking at taking out another loan with fellow US fund Pimco so that Inter can pay Oaktree loan and ensure that the club don't wind up owned by Oaktree as Milan did with Elliott in 2018. (AFP)

    NBA Nets name Spaniard Fernandez as new head coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fernandez coached Canada to bronze at last year's FIBA World Cup. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750072_1_20240423080738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jordi Fernandez, who guided Canada to a bronze medal in last year's World Cup, was named as the new head coach of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 41-year-old Spaniard, who had served as associate head coach of the Sacramento Kings for the past two seasons, will replace interim coach Kevin Ollie, who took over after Jacque Vaughn was fired in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're thrilled to announce Jordi Fernandez as Brooklyn's new head coach," Nets general manager Sean Marks said. "As we progressed through an extensive search over the past six weeks, it became increasingly clear that Jordi is the best coach to lead our team forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Jordi brings a diverse set of experiences and basketball knowledge gained over the course of a coaching career that has taken him around the world. Each step of the way, Jordi has consistently demonstrated the ability to implement strong processes and creative systems designed to optimize each team's specific roster."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez helped the Kings reach the playoffs for the first time since 2006 last year, although Sacramento was eliminated by Golden State in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kings were eliminated by New Orleans in the eighth-seed play-in game this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm truly grateful to lead the Nets," Fernandez said, calling it an "exciting and humbling opportunity" and added, "We will be fully committed to building something special for Nets fans and the borough to be proud of for years to come."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nets went 32-50 this season and missed the playoffs. Brooklyn has lost eight of 10 playoff series since moving from New Jersey in 2012, never advancing past the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with Jordi to build a sustainable winning culture in Brooklyn," Nets team owner Joe Tsai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez took over the Canadian national team last June and guided the squad to a 6-2 World Cup run, including a victory over the United States for third place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will still coach the Canadians at this year's Paris Olympics even with the Nets hiring, Canada Basketball said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez spent six seasons as an assistant coach with the Denver Nuggets, served as an assistant coach for Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympics and for Spain at the 2017 EuroBasket. (AFP)

    French teen candidate for 2024 NBA Draft: report

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Zaccharie Risacher plays for French side JLB Bourg. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750067_1_20240423074755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French teen Zaccharie Risacher submitted paperwork to the NBA to become eligible for the 2024 NBA Draft, where he is considered a potential number one selection, ESPN reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  If he is top pick, Risacher would follow in the footsteps of another French teen, Victor Wembanyama, who has had a stellar debut season at the San Antonio Spurs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 6-foot-10 [2.08m] small forward, who turned 19 two weeks ago, told ESPN he made the move to achieve a dream as he continues a strong season for JL Bourg of Pro A, the top French league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has always been my dream to get to the best league in the world," Risacher said. "I've been putting in the work for this since I was a kid. JL Bourg has given me an incredible opportunity to showcase what I can do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risacher is averaging 10.4 points and 3.4 rebounds while shooting 39% from 3-point range and he plays tough defensively, often opposing a rival's top scoring threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risacher, whose father Stephane was a star in European leagues and helped France take a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, sparked JL Bourg to the EuroCup Final that they lost earlier this month to Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's NBA Draft is June 26-27 in New York. The top selection order will be decided after the NBA Draft Lottery on May 12 in Chicago, with the 14 clubs who missed the playoffs having a chance to land the top pick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama was the top pick in last year's NBA Draft and posted impressive stats of 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocked shots and 1.2 steals a game in his first season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the French playoffs upcoming, Risacher will have many more games and much more travel than rivals of the same age in his NBA Draft class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of things I can bring an NBA team," he said. "My number one strength is my shooting. Then my defensive ability after that. And lastly, my ability to do what's asked of me, using my versatility -- I can rebound, handle the ball if needed, finish above the rim, pass the ball." (AFP)

 Nottingham Forest have asked for the VAR audio to be released from their three denied penalty appeals in a 2-0 defeat at Everton that sparked the club to call into question the integrity of Premier League officiating.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Forest issued an extraordinary post on social media soon after the final whistle at Goodison Park on Sunday saying they had "warned" referees body the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) that VAR official Stuart Attwell is a fan of relegation rivals Luton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest are just one point and one place above Luton, who are in the drop zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nottingham Forest has today submitted a formal request to the PGMOL to release into the public domain the audio recordings between officials during yesterday's match against Everton at Goodison Park," Forest said in a statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club has requested this be shared for three key match incidents - Ashley Young's challenge on Giovanni Reyna (24th minute), Ashley Young's handball (44th minute) and Ashley Young's challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi (56th minute).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We firmly advocate for the broader football community and supporters to have access to the audio and transcript for full transparency, ensuring the integrity of our sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PGMOL have been pressured into releasing audio recordings of controversial incidents earlier in the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referees' chiefs were forced to admit an error after Liverpool had a goal at Tottenham wrongly ruled out for offside as the VAR officials thought the goal had been awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Audio of other selected incidents has also been broadcast on the "Match Officials Mic'd Up" programme during the season, but the laws of the game prevent such audio being broadcast live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Football Association has asked Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo, defender Neco Williams and referee analyst Mark Clattenburg to explain comments they made post-match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest enlisted the services of former referee Clattenburg in February as a consultant analyst to fight in their corner after believing they had been on the wrong end of a series of contentious decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in his Daily Mail column, Clattenburg said: "One of these errors would have been bad enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Three was a joke, and that is why Nottingham Forest were left feeling victimised after another defeat in which zero big decisions went their way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Forest's public blast at the officials has been hit with a backlash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher accused the two-time European champions of sounding like a "fan in a pub."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Stuart Attwell and Anthony Taylor (the referee) have had an horrific day today, awful, and they should be rightly criticised for that and that could have real implications for Nottingham Forest," said Carragher, now a Sky Sports pundit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I get the frustration, but that, what I've just read there on social media, that's like a fan in a pub. That is embarrassing from Nottingham Forest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow pundit Gary Neville called on Clattenburg to resign from his role with the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If he sees those words go out, which question the integrity and essentially call a VAR official a cheat because he supports a certain club, then he's supporting what's being said and he would basically lose all credibility, I think, with referees in the game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win for Everton lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone with five games to play, despite being deducted eight points this season for breaches of financial rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest have been docked four points for the same reason. (AFP)

 Greek police on Monday made 60 arrests over hooligan violence that killed a riot officer during a volleyball game in December, the country's police chief said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Our commitment to combating sports violence is absolute," Dimitris Mallios said in a statement on the operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yiorgos Lyggeridis, 31, was fatally injured by a marine flare fired outside a sports hall during a December 2023 Olympiacos-Panathinaikos volleyball match near Piraeus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The riot police officer died later in hospital and stadia across the country were closed for several weeks after the death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mallios said a four-month police investigation had found links between hooligans and organised crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 150 people are suspected of involvement, Mallios said.

    No systemic Chinese doping, says Australian swim coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell says China is adamant about clean sport. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749950_1_20240422120145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell has rejected allegations of orchestrated doping in Chinese swimming, saying China is adamant about clean sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cotterell is working with China's top swimmers in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics and previously coached 1,500 metres freestyle world record holder Sun Yang, who is now suspended for a doping offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirmed reports over the weekend that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said it had accepted China's findings that the results were due to contamination and decided against appealing the matter, triggering criticism from top swimmers and the US anti-doping authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cotterell told the Sydney Morning Herald he stood by his swimmers "100%" and said any positive test results in Chinese swimming were not part of a state-run programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy to say I’m absolutely in support of my swimmers and dispute any suggestion of anything orchestrated," Cotterell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are so adamant on having clean sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's sad to see what this suggests or looks like. It’s unfortunate for everyone. I feel for the athletes here because of how hard they work now to eliminate the tag that was garnered in the '90s."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading coaches and swimmers criticised WADA and China's anti-doping authority over the weekend and questioned why the 23 swimmers' test results were not made public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cotterell said he understood if rival swimmers were upset and that the process could have been better handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It unfortunately allows that doubt to come out and to surface. I can’t prove anything, I just know the truth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he was also insistent that failed drug tests from contaminated food was a consistent risk in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(Swimmers) are not allowed to eat outside anywhere. When they go on a plane, they can’t eat the food," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports said the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), which is found in heart medication, months before the Tokyo Games started in July 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said after reviewing a television documentary and newspaper reports that it stands by its decision to clear the 23 swimmers to compete at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-doping agency issued a statement on Sunday following the release of a documentary on the cases by German broadcaster ARD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an earlier statement following initial newspaper reports, WADA said it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that the swimmers’ samples had been contaminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York Times reported that Chinese anti-doping authorities found the results of the tests were Adverse Analytical Findings but cleared the swimmers without any penalties after finding that the samples were flagged as positive as a result of contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Following WADA’s review of the documentary, the agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,” WADA said in the statement on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are equally confident that WADA’s independent Intelligence and Investigations Department followed up on all allegations received, which were not corroborated by any evidence; and thus, did not meet WADA threshold to open an investigation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said based on available scientific evidence and intelligence, “which was gathered, assessed and tested by experts in the pharmacology of trimetazidine (TMZ); and, by anti-doping experts,” it had no basis under the global anti-doping code to challenge the Chinese agency's findings of environmental contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry on Monday called reports about the swimmers testing positive "fake news".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe you will also have noted that the World Anti-Doping Agency has put out a very clear response," spokesman Weng Wenbin told a regular briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After an in-depth and detailed investigation of this incident by the China anti-doping centre in 2021, it was determined that the relevant athletes had ingested contaminated drugs without their knowledge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese swimmers involved were neither at fault nor guilty of negligence, and their behaviour did not constitute a doping violation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After an investigation, WADA affirmed the findings of the China anti-doping centre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that Beijing has a zero-tolerance position towards doping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We strictly adhere to the (relevant) global provisions and resolutely protect the physical and mental health of athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We uphold fair competition in sports events and have made active contributions to the global fight against doping," he said. (Agencies)
