<div class="itemFullText">
 For any Olympian, there's no shame in losing to the world's best player. There's even less shame when that player wasn't even born when you first competed at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But that's exactly the situation that 61-year-old table tennis player Ni Xialian found herself in in the women's singles in Paris. The Shanghai native, who represents her adopted country of Luxembourg, has been winning hearts as she proves that age is but a number ... even when it comes to playing a sport at the very highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni wrote herself into Olympic history as the oldest competitor to win a table tennis match when she beat Sibel Altinkaya of Turkey 4-2 in the round of 64 in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni, who won a mixed doubles world championship for China in her youth before moving to Europe, said she has already reached her goal of being able to compete at the Olympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Olympics has its own difficulties, but every time is exciting and a wonderful experience. For the technique part of the game, it depends on the draw," she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important. If you have some difficult draw, it's difficult. But of course, my age, you cannot against the nature. Every year getting more difficult, that's a fact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni's Olympic journey ended on Wednesday after being edged out by world number one Sun Yingsha of China, who is 38 years younger than her. Sun was born just a couple of months after Ni's first Olympic campaign, in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy to have this opportunity and not every day have such a chance, she's number one and people say I'm the only one, so I think it's a very happy, interesting game and we are showing Chinese table tennis [to] the world," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's such a strong, different generation and different area, and I hope I can offer a wonderful game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though Ni has completed her Olympic journey - at least until 2028 - she has won the hearts of many fans for her youthful spirit, becoming a social media hit after her inspiring performance at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people expressed their respect for her performance, while many others commented on the athlete's cuteness when she deployed spin to return her opponent’s shots.

 No medals for Hong Kong, China on Day 6 of the Olympic Games in Paris, although the SAR's athletes saw action in the pool and on the waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were more golds to celebrate for China in men's shooting and women's athletics, plus an historic result for Zheng Qinwen who beat the world number one to reach the women's Olympic tennis final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of the day, China top the medals table with 11 golds, with the US in second place. Hong Kong are now ranked 14th with two gold and two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's what happened.

   Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheng dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the women's event, Ma fell two places to finish 14th overall and was also out of the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday was placed 28th out of 43 after two races, with eight still to come over the coming four days.
   <br/>

    <br/>

    Ian Ho also failed to progress in his event. The 27-year-old came last in his 50m freestyle heat with a time of 22.12 seconds.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He finished in joint 24th place out of 73 swimmers.

     Later, China's Yang Jiayu blazed to gold in the women's 20km race walk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 28-year-old pulled ahead of the field after the 5km mark, and barely looked back to cross the finish line in a time of one hour, 25 minutes and 54 seconds.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kate Douglass underlined her remarkable versatility with gold in the women's 200 metres breaststroke at the Paris Olympics on Thursday, beating Tokyo champion Tatjana Smith who bows out of a stellar swimming career with a silver medal in her final race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking full advantage of her turning prowess, American Douglass nudged ahead of Smith after every length and held off the South African to touch the wall in 2:19.24 at La Defense Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really excited. I feel like for a while I wasn't sure if Olympic champion was going to be possible for me to say, and now it's just really exciting to see it happen," Douglas told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion Tes Schouten won bronze for the Netherlands, her first Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's finals, Hubert Kos took Hungary's first swimming gold of the Paris Olympics when he won the men's 200 metres backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Apostolos Christou took the silver and Switzerland's Roman Mityukov the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia rounded out the evening with victory in the women's 4x200 metres relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holders didn't have it all their own way though, as they were pushed hard in the first three legs by the US and defending champions China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, world record holder Ariarne Titmus anchored the Aussies to an Olympic-record winning gold while the US took silver and China the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US silver meant also that Katie Ledecky became the most decorated female swimmer of all time with 13 Olympic medals. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zhang Yufei came up short in her title defence of the 200m butterfly, coming back third while relinquishing her Olympic record to eventual champion Summer McIntosh of Canada.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang, who earlier took bronze in the 100m butterfly, was in the chase at the halfway mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But McIntosh powered into a decisive lead by the final turn of the pool, while American Regan Smith also caught up with Zhang down the stretch to clinch silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh touched the wall after two minutes and 3.03 seconds, smashing the previous record set in Tokyo by more than eight-tenths of a second. Zhang came back over two seconds later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Jiangsu native has one more shot at gold in the 50m freestyle, which starts on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday evening, China added a bronze in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Junxuan and Li Bingjie, who were part of the quartet who struck gold in Tokyo, were joined by Ge Chutong and Liu Yaxin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finished at just over seven minutes and 42 seconds, around four seconds behind winners Australia, while the United States took silver.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong scraped through to the men's singles semi-final after a pulsating contest against Japan's Tomokazu Harimoto.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who bagged silver in Tokyo, erased a two-game deficit before outlasting his opponent 4-3 in 68 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was a major relief for Chinese fans, after top seed Wang Chuqin suffered a shock exit in the round of 32 yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan's defeat would be a huge disappointment for China, as they have finished on the podium of the men's singles in every Games since 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I didn't perform particularly well today, and allowed my opponent to dictate the rhythm," Fan told RTHK after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to break through, and kept my confidence. Eventually I found a way while keeping the score close, and waited for the momentum to shift."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will next take on 17-year-old French prodigy Felix Lebrun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Sun Yingsha reached the last four in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed has not dropped a single game so far in Paris, going 16-0 following her latest victory over Chinese Taipei's Cheng I-ching in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, who already bagged a gold in the mixed doubles, will next face Hina Hayata of Japan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Simone Biles clinched her sixth Olympic gold medal in front of an ecstatic crowd at the Paris Games on Thursday, reasserting her status as the number one all-around gymnast three years after she withdrew from the same final at the Tokyo Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight race between Biles and Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, the American was surprisingly left trailing in third place after a flawed performance on the uneven bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she was back on top after a solid performance on her next apparatus - the balance beam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she waited to perform last on the floor, she knew the gold would be hers if she avoided any unexpected slip ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She executed an electrifying routine to secure the gold with a total of 59.131 points, just 1.199 points ahead of her Brazilian rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrade earned a second successive silver in the competition where each gymnasts needs to show off their skills on all four women's apparatus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles' teammate Sunisa Lee, the Tokyo all-around champion, fought back from a disappointing start on the vault to claim thee bronze with 56.465 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles captured her second gold medal of the Paris Games, and her second all-around Olympic title after also winning the individual event in Rio in 2016. She also claimed the team gold earlier this week. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma have both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng entered the day ranked ninth overall out of 24 men's entrants, having won a race yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two remaining races were scrapped, meaning the 24-year-old had no chance to make up lost ground. Only the top 10 surfers would reach the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma, on the other hand, fell two places to finish 14th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was disqualified on the first race on Thursday, and placed 15th and 10th in the ensuing two. Like the men's competition, the two final women's races were cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday has a lot of catching up to do after the opening day of dinghy competition in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Olympic debutante is placed 28th out of 43 after two races, with eight still to come over the coming four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner for each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday is now on 49 points, compared with 27 for Jean-Baptiste Bernaz of France in 10th place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy's Lorenzo Musetti knocked defending champion Alexander Zverev out of the Olympic Games tennis tournament on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Musetti triumphed 7-5, 7-5 over the German world number four in the quarter-finals and will face either top seed Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas for a place in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz of Spain stormed into the semi-finals with an imperious display of tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, playing on the same Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros where he captured the French Open in June, saw off 13th-ranked Tommy Paul of the United States 6-3, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Alcaraz recovered from a break down in the second set to defeat Paul, having also beaten the American in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon on his way to the title at the All England Club last month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen of China stunned women's world number one Iga Swiatek on Thursday to become the first player from the nation to reach an Olympic Games tennis singles final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventh-ranked Zheng triumphed 6-2, 7-5 and will face either Croatia's Donna Vekic or Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel more than just happy – happy isn't enough to describe how I feel," said Zheng, who had played back-to-back three-hour matches to make the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you ask me to play another three hours for my country, I would. It was an amazing match. To beat Iga is not easy, as it's an important event for her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek, a four-time French Open champion at Roland Garros, went into Thursday's match at a sweltering Court Philippe Chatrier on a 25-match win streak in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old had defeated Zheng in all of their six previous meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the mixed doubles, the Chinese pair of Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen reached the final after defeating their opponents from the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Zhang were slow off the block in the semi-final, conceding the opening set 2-6 to Demi Schuurs and Wesley Koolhof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese pair levelled the match at one set apiece by winning set two 6-4, before clinching the tie-break 10-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will face the winner of the other semi-final between the pairs from Canada and the Czech Republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final is scheduled on Saturday morning, Hong Kong time at Roland Garros. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Hong Kong swimmers on Thursday failed to make it out of the heats at Paris La Defense Arena, bringing their Olympic journeys to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cindy Cheung, the youngest member to represent the SAR in swimming, competed in the women’s 200m backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old maintained a steady pace in her heat against two others, finishing in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She clocked 2 minutes 17.32 seconds, more than 4 seconds behind the winner Tatiana Salcutan of Moldova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who came 26th overall among 27 swimmers, said she was not happy with her performance but that her experience in Paris had been invaluable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the end, this was a very good learning experience. I got to see how the Olympic Village was like, and experienced what it was like to compete at such a high level – the feeling is very different," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though my finishing time was not up to my expectations, this was an experience that's hard to come by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men’s side, Ian Ho also concluded his second Olympics in the pool after he failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the men’s 50m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old came last in his heat with a time of 22.12 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished in joint 24th place out of 73 swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really can’t complain. It’s been a good Olympics for me, and to have such a different experience from last time...Really, I’m grateful for what I’ve been able to do," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and Ho were eliminated from the women’s 100m backstroke and the men’s 100m freestyle earlier.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cedric Ho recalls having doubts about his career. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764124_2_20240731231321.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencers Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho said they're aiming higher after making their Olympic debuts in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both hope to continue to shine in the sport thanks to the spirit of never giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan bowed out of the women’s foil individual event after she was beaten by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16. Still, it's the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old recalled enjoying every moment on the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I was just focusing on the skills or tactics, what I want to do and just try my very best to score. And even though I know at the very end the gap was quite big, I didn't give up. Actually in my mind, I just want to try all my stuff and I just want to do my best," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said fellow fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung’s triumphs motivated her and other young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was amazing because my competition day was in the middle. So like before my competition day I saw Vivian got the gold medal… They brought home two gold medals which is never easy, and I think a lot of citizens will know fencing this sport and I think more and more kids will be joining this sport as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a part-time fencer who’s studying in the United States, Chan said it was difficult to juggle between fencing and her studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she made it clear she didn’t want to give up the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho, meanwhile, recalled being at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The idea of giving up came up most when I was at my lowest point, which was about two or three years after the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers. I was a bit down and confused and kind of wanted to give up, but luckily I got through in the end,” the 28-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho is the first male épéeist from the SAR to qualify for the Olympics in 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to Japan's Masaru Yamada in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This proves that we have worked very hard in the men's épée category for the past 12 years. The success of our men's épée is due to the whole team and the coaches working together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said he's proud of Ho’s performance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel that he has a lot of takeaways. He's seen his potential, his strengths, and he also has seen his room for improvement. And I hope that we can keep on growing together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu added he's confident that fencing will continue to develop in Hong Kong because of government support and infrastructure being put in place.

 Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet were the last shuttlers from Hong Kong to bow out of the Paris Olympics, as they shared an emotional moment following defeat in the mixed doubles quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The long-time partners on the court were brushed aside in straight games by the third-seeded pair of Chae Yu-jung and Seo Seung-jae.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans needed just 39 minutes to finish off the SAR duo, winning 21-15, 21-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang and Tse went down by as much as 9-16 in the opening game, before taking five of the next seven points to go within 14-18. They never got closer than that, however, and the Koreans hung on to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chae and Seo then asserted control of game two with an 8-1 run, and never relinquished the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Tang and Tse had trouble holding back tears while meeting the press afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse, who said she's grateful just to compete in Paris, revealed for the first time that she was in a hospital emergency ward two or three weeks ago but did not specify the reason.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Perhaps in the past month, I've cried every single day while on the court. Jordan withstood a lot from me," Tse said as she briefly lost her composure in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I couldn't even squeeze a toothpaste... or comb my hair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also heaped praise on Tang, saying without him she might have retired a long time ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, for his part, thanked Tse for not giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also picked up bumps and bruises here and there so I understand how difficult it is... Returning to a high level after injury is never easy, yet she's done it many times."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added they've been under immense pressure in the past year or so punching their Paris tickets, as they had trailed so much in the rankings.

 China's new swimming prodigy Pan Zhanle smashed his own world record as he destroyed the field to clinch a gold medal in men's 100m freestyle at the Olympics early on Thursday.

  Australian Kyle Chalmers, more than a full second behind Pan, took silver, while Romanian David Popovici got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan's superb performance won Team China their 9th gold medal at the Paris Games and their first in the pool. It was also the first swimming world record of this year's Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey snagged another bronze medal on Thursday in the women’s 100 metres freestyle event in Paris, making her the first Hongkonger to clinch four Olympic medals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey stayed around the front of the pack throughout the first 50 metres, and was able to pull herself into second place behind the fast-starting American Torri Huske at the turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pushed through the last 50 metres and was in contention thoughout to grab a spot on the podium with a time of 52.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s world record holder Sarah Sjoestroem surged through to claim the gold with a time of 52.16 seconds, while Huske was 0.13 seconds back to pip Haughey for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters that she knew it would be a highly competitive race, so she just wanted to focus on enjoying the whole process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that my training for this race in the past few years was more intense compared to the Tokyo Olympics. I practised a lot more in terms of training time, number of minutes, and distance. Especially as you get older, your body recovery is getting worse," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Children watching TV, everyone needs to add oil (keep going). The whole journey may not be easy, but if you have a dream, just keep chasing it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey earlier won the bronze in the 200 metres freestyle event, as well as two silver medals at the Tokyo Olympics in the same respective events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sjoestroem, who set the world record back in 2017, had only committed to join the 100 metres at the last minute having previously indicated she'd focus on her favoured 50m free.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese gymnasts suffered another blow at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Thursday, after Japan's Oka Shinnosuke secured gold following a neck-and-neck battle in the men's individual all-round discipline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka and the Chinese pair of Xiao Ruoteng and Zhang Boheng were leading the pack after completing five of the six routines, with less than 0.37 points separating the trio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang went last on the last routine - the horizontal bar - and needed 14.9 points to seal victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But minor flaws in his performance meant he ended up 0.2 points short, handing victory to Oka who reigned supreme with a final score of 86.832. Xiao rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan have now won the event four consecutive times, but their defence did not come easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang stumbled out of the gate in the floor exercise, with his score of 13.233 points being one of the worst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he recovered since, even rising to medal contention with a strong 15.3 points on the parallel bars in the fifth round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang and Xiao were part of the Chinese group who coughed up the gold medal in the team event on Monday. Their teammate Su Weide fell twice from the bar in the final routine, enabling a dramatic comeback by Japan to snatch gold from China's hands.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen on Wednesday became only the second Chinese tennis player to reach the singles semi-finals at an Olympics, beating German veteran Angelique Kerber 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(6) in the quarter-finals in a three-set thriller.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two tough sets, Kerber, who won a silver medal at Rio 2016, took the lead in the third to 4-1 and received a standing ovation from an enthusiastic French crowd after saving a huge break point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having run out of steam on a hot and humid Philippe Chatrier court and lost 10 points in a row, she bounced back to 4-4. But Zheng's powerful shots allowed her to win the tiebreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the quarter-finals, at a tournament the 36-year-old had said would be her last, was the former world number one's best performance this year after returning from maternity leave in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German had lost in the first round of this year's three Grand Slams so far, the Australian and French Open followed by Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng reached a career-high ranking of No. 7 after her runner-up finish at the Australian Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men's side, Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz shrugged off crushing humidityto stay on course for an Olympic gold medal showdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, seeking a first Olympic title at Roland Garros to add to his record-breaking collection, defeated German left-hander Dominik Koepfer 7-5, 6-3, becoming the first man to reach four singles quarter-finals at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu concluded his maiden Olympic campaign on Wednesday after losing to old rival Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei in their group stage finale.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was sent packing after 12th-seeded Chou wrapped up a 21-18, 21-13 victory in 44 minutes to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 17 Lee, who was beaten by Chou in eight of their 12 previous matchups, mostly played catch-up in their latest encounter. The SAR shuttler came back from six points down in the opening game to make it 18-19, before his opponent delivered perfect smashes to take the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chou once again moved in front in the ensuing game with a 12-6 lead, and Lee failed to erase the deficit the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the press after the match, Lee said he felt he could have done better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather up and down emotionally... I give myself too much pressure, I wanted to prove myself to others," he conceded, holding back tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before arriving [in Paris], I told my coaches, this is my only chance to prove to the world who Lee Cheuk-yiu is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to address his weaknesses and consistency issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the La Chapelle Arena in Paris, Chinese Taipei veteran Tai Tzu-ying suffered a shock group stage exit in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three, who bagged silver in Tokyo, was stunned by Ratchanok Intanon from Thailand in straight games, 19-21, 15-21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai, who was battling multiple injuries, burst into tears after the match and shared a warm embrace with her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did my best, based on my condition at this year's Games," a tearful Tai told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I can say that I have tried my best. But of course, speed-wise I was unable to catch up to my opponent."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Alex Cheng has notched his maiden race victory in the men's windsurfing competition off Marseille.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The win on his seventh attempt propelled Cheng to 11th overall among 24 entrants. He climbed another two places to ninth after coming back seventh, 10th and fifth respectively in the next three races on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five remaining races are scheduled for Thursday afternoon, local time. Only the top 10 boats in the 15-race opening series will advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng's SAR teammate, Mui Ma, dropped one place to 12th overall after another four races on Wednesday in the women's iQFOiL event. The 26-year-old started strong, finishing seventh on race eight, but her performance tapered off as the day progressed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In sailing, Hong Kong's Akira Sakai and Russell Alysworth remain last out of 20 teams following the penultimate race in the men's skiff category. Only the top 10 boats will enter the medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Nautical Stadium in Vaires-sur-Marne, east of Paris, SAR rower Chiu Hin-chun finished fifth in the six-strong semi-final of the singles skulls with a time of seven minutes, 3.68 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will wrap up his Olympic campaign on Thursday with a ranking race determining the 19th to 24th places.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Jason Ng did not finish the triathlon race which took place under the blazing Paris heat, ending his maiden Olympic journey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng completed the 1,500-metre swim in 24 minutes and 6 seconds, with a transition time of 51 seconds before starting the 40-kilometre bike ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not finish the course and was eliminated before putting on his running shoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Ng said his performance suit's zipper was pulled off during the triathlon competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the midst of the competition, my trisuit was grabbed by someone and the zipper in the back was pulled off," Ng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water kept going into my suit, and it became like a parachute. The entire suit kept pulling me backwards, and it didn't help with the water resistance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Alex Yee pipped New Zealand's Hayden Wilde for an amazing victory in the event. The Tokyo silver medallist showed his pacing mastery of the 10-km run, passing a flagging Wilde with less than 400 metres to go in blazing sunshine and 30 degree Celsius heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been postponed for a day due to the poor water quality of the Seine River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel, a Mexican living in Paris who watched the race along Avenue des Champs-Élysées, said it was worth the wait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m assuming that the people were testing the levels of bacteria. I had heard all of the things they needed to do properly so I’m glad that they did wait and it was well worth the wait. Honestly it was a great race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kristen, a spectator from New Jersey, said she enjoyed watching the race but not the idea of swimming in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I'm glad that the sun was better for them today. I still think it's gross that they had to swim in that [river],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, France's Cassandre Beaugrand won a historic gold in a thrilling women's individual triathlon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland's Julie Derron dug deep to win silver, while Great Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wong Chun-ting of Hong Kong put up a good fight in his round-of-32 men's table tennis singles match at the Paris Olympics, but he was no match for second-seeded Fan Zhendong of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan was off to a fast start, racing to a 2-0 lead by taking the first two games 11-5, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong came to life in the third game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He jumped out to leads of 4-0 and 5-1 before holding on for an 11-9 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fan simply proved too strong for his SAR opponent. He went on to capture the next two games 11-6, 11-3 to complete a 4-1 win in 36 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said after the match that this could well be his last Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Olympics this year is special. For one, I am already 33 years old, so I am considering this Olympics to be my last. Because for the next one, four years later, whether or not I can get the chance to compete is unknown, too much uncertainty," he said.

  The 27-year-old kept it close in the first game, losing 13-11, but then lost the next three games, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9, in the match that lasted 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhu is choosing to look ahead, instead focusing on the positives despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy this time, and I enjoyed every game," she said after the match. "I think it’s normal whether I win or lose – there will be a women’s team battle next, so I will prepare well for every game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anything is possible because of this venue. Although I was not feeling as confident today, if I am confident, anything is possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Zhu is next set to compete in the women's team round of 16 next Tuesday, when the Hong Kong, China team take on Sweden at South Paris Arena 4.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great joy that we received this news," Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, said. "Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five women representing 34 countries and regions will kick off the contest at 2pm Hong Kong time, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Jason Ng will participate in the men's event, which begins at 4.45pm, immediately after the women's race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The results of the latest water analyses...have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place," Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris has spent US$1.52 billion of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill. (Reuters)

    Wong Ka-lee tells judokas Olympics not a pipe dream

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wong Ka-lee says she wants to show young judokas that it's possible to reach the Olympics. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763678_1_20240731090156.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Olympian Wong Ka-lee said she hopes her journey to Paris will inspire other young judokas to pursue their dreams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was the third judoka ever from Hong Kong to qualify for the Olympics, marking the return of a local judoka to the Games after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was eliminated in the women’s under 48kg competition by Austrian Katharina Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Wong believes her presence in the Olympics would show others that they too can make it to the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Younger [athletes] may think the Olympics are out of reach. But going to the Olympics this time can show them that it’s not. They can all do it,” she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete said her judo journey is far from over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics are a good experience. I see that I have obviously improved this year in terms of throwing techniques. I hope I can perform better in the next competition,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-time Olympian said she will stay in Paris to watch the matches of top judokas and visit wineries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said she will continue to sharpen her skills, and her next goal is the Asian Judo Open Hong Kong which starts in November.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There was plenty of action at the Olympics in Paris with Siobhan Haughey qualifying as the top seed in the final of the women's 100m freestyle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong, China now ranks 10th in the medals table with China second in the tally with six golds. Japan maintain their lead at the top of the table with seven gold medals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Siobhan Haughey is heading into the women’s 100m freestyle showdown as the favourite, after qualifying the fastest out of the 16 swimmers in the semi-finals at La Defense Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey, who notched a silver in Tokyo, clocked 52.64 seconds, 0.08 seconds ahead of Australia’s Shayna Jack in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old SAR star was only fourth at the halfway mark, but moved past her rivals with a late charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Yang Junxuan also punched her final ticket alongside world recorder holder Sarah Sjoestroem, but Wu Qingfeng barely missed out on a spot after finishing ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the pool, China's Pan Zhanle also qualified fastest in the men's 100m freestyle semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world and Olympic record holder will go up against Australia's Kyle Chalmers, the 2016 champion who set a time of 47.58 seconds, 0.37 seconds slower than Yang.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States reclaimed the women's gymnastics team gold in dominant fashion on Tuesday, while Simone Biles took centre stage again with a captivating performance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biles, together with teammates Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Sunisa Lee, led wire-to-wire. They finished with a score of 171.296, 5.802 more than silver medallists Italy, while Brazil rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, winners at the 2008 Beijing Games, finished a disappointing sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a shocking withdrawal from the team event in Tokyo, Biles has cemented her status as the world's most decorated gymnast by clinching her fifth Olympic gold, and eighth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Americans already had gold in the bag when Biles brought the Bercy Arena crowd to their feet with a gravity-defying floor routine that featured two of her signature skills - a double back flip with a half twist and the "triple-double" of two back flips with three twists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-seven-year-old Biles is set to add more medals to her cabinet after qualifying to four individual events in Paris. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu made a winning start in his maiden Olympic appearance, beating Mexico's Luis Ramon Garrido in the group stage of the men's singles tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee, the world number 17 who missed out on a spot for the Tokyo Games in 2021, overpowered his opponent 21-5 in the first game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 66th-ranked Garrido, who was also making his Olympic debut in Paris, took the ensuing game 21-15 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair exchanged leads in a nail-biting finale, but Lee eventually came out on top after pulling away late on to win 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top men's shuttler from the SAR next faces Chou Tien-chien of Chinese Taipei Wednesday evening, Hong Kong time. The winner of that match will advance to the round of 16, as Chou had already beaten Garrido earlier in their group tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a different story for another local badminton player, Happy Lo, who ended her Olympic journey after losing her second straight group match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supanida Katethong of Thailand beat Lo 21-14, 21-9.

 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China said it respects the decision of the referees in a controversy involving fencer Edgar Cheung's win over his Italian opponent in the individual foil final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The Olympic Games are the highest-level events in the world. As always, the SF&OC and athletes adhere to and firmly believe in the Olympic spirit, respecting all game results and referee decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian Fencing Federation earlier lodged a complaint against what it called “unacceptable refereeing decisions” in Cheung's 15-14 win over Fillippo Macchi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President of the federation, Paolo Azzi, said he was disappointed with the conclusion the match, adding that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been robbed of the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were two occasions where both fencers landed their touches, but the referees from Chinese Taipei and South Korea ruled that no point should be awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macchi wrote in his Instagram post that he didn’t want to blame the referees for his defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that for sure the refereeing could have been better. It's impossible to not call three touches but at the end of the day that's the nature of the competition," Nicola Lu, epee coach of SAR fencer Cedric Ho, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have external factors that we cannot control and we can only focus on doing our best and focusing on our own actions,” Lu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case also sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian netizens on the social media platforms of the two fencers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, felt it was unlikely that Cheung will be stripped of his gold due to Italy's appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don’t think it will affect [the result] because the referees were very careful. They made the judgement after watching video replays many times. Even when you ask [other] people to review the play, it will still be the same result," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that the referees must decide responsibly when it’s hard to tell who wins or loses, adding that it’s normal for people to have different interpretations.

 Chinese pair Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha captured the gold medal for the table tennis mixed doubles event at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday, after defeating Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong of North Korea 4-2 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded Chinese duo, who won the 2021 and 2023 World championships, beat their North Korean opponents 11-6, 7-11, 11-8, 11-5, 7-11 and 11-8 at the South Paris Arena 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, North Korea said they could learn from China after winning their first Olympic medal in eight years on Tuesday in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For China, it was their first Olympic gold medal in the table tennis mixed doubles, after the event made its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020, where Japanese pair Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito won the gold in a Japan-China final on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal was won by South Korean paddlers Lim Jong-hoon and Shin Yu-bin who beat Wong Chun-ting and Doo Hoi-kem from Hong Kong, China 4-0 earlier in the day. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting fought hard in the bronze-medal match of the mixed doubles table tennis event at the Paris Olympics, but they weren’t able to make it to the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team on Tuesday lost 0-4 to South Korea’s Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon in a match lasting 39 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean pair were off to a quick start, winning the first game 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then raced to a 3-0 lead, taking the second and third games 11-7, 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong pushed hard to catch up in a nail-biting fourth game, but it eventually went to Shin and Lim, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although we missed the medal by a small margin, the fact that we got into the top four this time is already a big breakthrough," Doo said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because actually there were a lot of teams before whose ability were better or similar to ours. Including the semi-finals, we really did keep trying to become better. Even though the ending was not the best, we did try our best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the defeat, it's the best finish for Hong Kong in mixed doubles table tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it's a bit of a pity, especially since we had a chance to get a medal both today and yesterday," Wong said. "Although we are not very satisfied with our performance today, we were already thinking hard and communicating with each other about any strategy we can have before the match."

    Gauff crashes out of Paris Olympics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gauff talks with an official during her match against Croatia's Donna Vekic. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763919_1_20240730203828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff was left in tears after getting into an extended argument with the chair umpire over a ruling during the reigning U.S. Open champion's 7-6 (7), 6-2 loss to Donna Vekic of Croatia in a Paris Olympics third-round singles match Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number two Gauff claimed she was "getting cheated" over a line call in the sixth game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She then walked over to talk to the official, and play was delayed for several minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball," Gauff said to Campistol. “It’s not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her first Olympic singles tournament – she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles – ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 32 degrees celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimmer Ian Ho has been eliminated from the men’s 100m freestyle event on Tuesday at the Olympic Games, finishing 55th overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is competing for the second time at the Games, finished sixth in his heat with a time of 51.46 seconds, 2.62 seconds behind the heat 5 winner Lamar Taylor of the Bahamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's definitely a different experience, but it's a little more familiar, so I'm glad I can be here again,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself. Swimming is a sport where you can focus on yourself and do the best race that you can, and that's what I've tried to do over the past couple of days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Alexy of the United States led all 79 swimmers with a time of 47.57 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only the 16 fastest from the heats qualify for the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho will also compete in the men’s 50m freestyle in Paris.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have failed to advance in the women's doubles in badminton at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their final group match on Tuesday, the SAR duo lost to Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first game was a closely fought affair before the No 4 seed from China prevailed, 21-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second game was also close with the score tied several times early on, before Liu and Tan put on a late charge to come away 21-15 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did well because we didn't fear them for their ranking. Even when we were trailing by many points during the match, we absolutely didn't give up and we tried to fight point by point," Lianne Yeung said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair finished in third place in Group B with one win and two losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the group and Bulgaria came second, both advancing to the next round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A sports psychologist says the Olympic Games highlight how athletes need to work on their mental state if they want to perform well, and not just their physical fitness and sporting skill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Karen Lo, whose clients include SAR Olympic athletes, on Tuesday said athletes need the mental discipline to maintain composure and focus, even when things aren't going their way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to remain calm and focused when you're losing, and also even when you're leading by a couple of points because you want to continue to lead as well. These are skills that are not so related to your fitness level, or physique, or your strategy and tactics. This is more on the mental side of the game," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that athletes may face extra pressures, such as performance anxiety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Athletes are human beings, they struggle with their mental health just like anyone else in Hong Kong. However, their identity is an athlete, they might feel extremely nervous handling expectations from the local community, and also coaches, that might be unique from everyone else," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that athletes can make use of psychological workshops and sessions to identify the underlying reasons for any confidence issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun's hopes of capturing a medal at the Paris Olympics came to an end on Tuesday, after he finished last among six competitors in the first quarter-final of the men's rowing single sculls event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clocked in a time of seven minutes 13.7 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew I was competing against seeded players in the quarter-finals, so I tried to catch up with them in the first 500 metres," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it would be challenging, but I didn't want to give up. The process was difficult and I had only myself, from preparing for the match to drawing up a race plan."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will row again in the C and D semi-finals on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World Triathlon on Tuesday said the Paris Olympics men's triathlon event will be postponed by a day, after tests showed the water quality in the River Seine was not up to standard.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The development means Hong Kong's Jason Ng is now scheduled to compete on Wednesday at 4.45pm. He was originally going to race at 2pm on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tests carried out in the Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held," World Triathlon said in a statement, adding the International Olympic Committee, Meteo France and Paris officials were involved in conducting the water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, meteorological events beyond our control, such as the rain which fell over Paris on 26 and 27 July, can alter water quality and compel us to reschedule the event for health reasons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's triathlon event will also take place on Wednesday, with World Triathlon saying both events are subject to future water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Paris based hydrologist had earlier told RTHK that rainstorms in the 24 hours before a swimming event in the Seine could wash storm water off the land surfaces around the city, bringing pollution with it.

<div class="itemFullText">
 It was another action packed day on Monday at the Olympics in Paris with Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung making history for Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung distinguished himself with the successful defence of his Olympic title in the men's individual foil while Haughey won a consecutive medal in the 200 free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China now ranks tenth in the medals table with China third in the tally with five golds thanks to efforts from their divers and shooters. Japan top the table ahead of hosts France.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king Edgar Cheung defended his Olympic gold medal in men's foil in dramatic fashion after making a brilliant comeback in the final match against Italian Filippo Macchi in the early hours of Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian pulled ahead 14-12, but Cheung immediately gained two points to bring the game into a tie-breaker for the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the score tied at 14-14, the fencing got even more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On two occasions, both fencers thought they had won the last point, but the judges said it was too close to rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After three attempts to break the tie, Cheung took home the win for Hong Kong, China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he couldn't believe he's the first athlete to repeat in men's foil in 68 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe [that I've won]...and being the first man to repeat in so long, actually, I really rather can't believe it," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of the best moments in my life. To have a gold medal in France, with a French coach, for me it's a wonderful day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he woke up not feeling too good, but when he fenced, it was different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said coach Greg Koenig told him not to focus on the judges' decisions late in the game, and focus on the next move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach, for his part, said he never doubted that Cheung could overcome his deficit at 12-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three last points, to be honest, I know he can do it. I will stay positive. I will send him my maximum positive energy because I know, three points in a row for him is absolutely nothing," Koenig said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory helped him claim his second gold in as many Games and becomes the first athlete from the SAR to grab consecutive Olympic titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong now has two gold medals in Paris, both in fencing, the most ever won at a single Games so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, the Italian Fencing Federation has lodged an official complaint with the International Fencing Federation and the International Olympic Committee over what it considers to be unacceptable refereeing decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation President Paolo Azzi expressed his disappointment at the conclusion of the competition, claiming that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been unfairly denied the gold medal he deserved.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey won a consecutive medal in the women's 200m freestyle, earning bronze on top of the silver she won in Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong star was among the first to turn at the half-way point before her Australian rivals Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus turned up the heat in the second 100 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Callaghan pulled away from Titmus and Haughey in the last lap to win in an Olympic record time of 1 minute, 53.27 seconds, 0.54 seconds ahead of defending champion Titmus who settled for silver while Haughey picked up the bronze in a time of 1 minute, 54.55.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said after the race that her time wasn't as good as she thought it would be, but she's still satisfied with the result, saying the Australian swimmers were really strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said it was a special moment for her because when she won silvers in Tokyo, there were no spectators because of Covid, and she's glad that her parents were among many in the crowd cheering her on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star swimmer also thanked Hongkongers for staying up to support her and other SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you so much for everyone who's been waking up really early to watch our races, our matches and competitions," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really been on social media a lot these past few days, but I've received everyone's messages and all the love and support, so, thank you so much and please keep supporting us because it means the world to us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Haughey's third Olympic medal following the two silvers she won in the 100m and 200m freestyle events at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is due to compete in the women's 100m free on Tuesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Summer McIntosh set the pool alight at La Defense Arena in Paris, with a commanding victory in the women's 400m individual medley.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Canadian won in a time of 4 minutes, 27.71 seconds, ahead of American silver medallist Katie Grimes and her bronze-winning US teammate Emma Weyant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh's triumph comes two days after taking silver behind Australian powerhouse Ariarne Titmus in the 400m freestyle on the meet's opening on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, the men's 200m freestyle a closely fought battle between at least six swimmers in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, it was Romanian teenager David Popovici who powered to the gold medal on Monday, edging Britain's Matthew Richards by a fingertip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old touched in 1 minute 44.72 seconds ahead of Richards who took silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Luke Hobson took bronze in a frantic finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was Popovici's first Olympic medal after missing out in Tokyo where he came fourth and he also became the first Romanian male to win an Olympic gold in swimming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another gold for Italy as world record holder Thomas Ceccon won the men's 100m backstroke gold at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Xu Jiayu took silver, with 2016 gold medallist Ryan Murphy of the US taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also won silver in the women's 100m breaststroke as Tang Qianting finished just behind Tatjana Smith of South Africa who added the 100 breast title to the 200m gold she won in Tokyo three years ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese men's gymnastic team took home silver at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Tuesday, as two falls from one of the gymnasts in the final round proved to be too costly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japan took gold on 259.594 points, a little more than half a point ahead of China. The United States got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China led by more than three points heading into the final round, with Xiao Ruoteng, Su Weide and Zhang Boheng up on the horizontal bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su slipped and lost his grip on the bar twice in his routine, for a subpar score of 11.6. Zhang was unable to make up for the deficit in the last routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China had taken the lead after the first three rotations, with exceptional performances on the rings, led by Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Liu Yang, and strong scores on the horse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan and Zhang then extended the advantage with slick moves on the parallel bars, with Zou getting 16 points on the apparatus, the highest individual score in the entire event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su had a night to forget as his slips also meant the chance at gold faded away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese themselves had to overcome a poor start to the competition to capture gold in the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China snatched bronzes in the same event at both the Tokyo and Rio Olympics.

 Edgar Cheung is through to the final of the men's individual foil after beating his Japanese opponent in the semis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung prevailed against Kazuki Iimura 15-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both fencers started the match with quick points, as they went neck to neck in a gripping semi-final match. Cheung was able to widen the gap and ultimately take the win with seconds still remaining in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gregory Koenig said they are here for the gold once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He really could control his emotions. He showed real maturity in his fencing. Whatever the score was, he was really focused so it was amazing,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We still have one more match. We came here for the gold and we will give the maximum for the gold.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be the second fencing medal for Hong Kong, China, given Cheung is guaranteed at least a silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also means Cheung becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to have a chance at defending their Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If he wins, Cheung would be the first man to defend an Olympic foil title since 1956.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will face Italian Filippo Macchi in the final at 4.10am Hong Kong time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s windsurfers were finally able to make some waves in the south of France, with Mui Ma ranking fourth after finishing her first day of Olympic races.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma finished sixth and fifth in her two races respectively. There are five races in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her fellow windsurfer Alex Cheng ranked 20th after his first race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR’s skiff sailors, Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth, remained in second to last place after completing half of their races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The windsurfing competitions were postponed for a day due to a lack of wind down in Marseilles.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis stars Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting will play for a mixed doubles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, after losing to North Korea's pair 3-4 in the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an up and down match, with Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong, the lowest seed in this tournament, starting with a bang and taking the first game 3-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong then took the second game 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth-seeded Hong Kong pair then had a 2-1 edge after winning the third game 11-3. But they dropped the next two, 9-11, 9-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall at the South Paris Arena, Doo and Wong went on to win the sixth game 11-9 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's when the North Koreans went on the attack, as they jumped out to a 7-0 lead behind Ri's strong forehand smashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair fought their way back to make it 6-9, before eventually dropping the final game 6-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Korean giant killers had started the tournament defeating the world number two pair, Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan, in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo will face South Korea's Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon, who lost to China's top-seeded Sun Yingsha and Wang Chuqin in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, Wong said they gave it their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Facing these North Koreans, they're the so-called dark horses. But any team in the final four has to be very good. So actually, when we faced them, we felt we were the dark horses," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So on the table, we fought until the very end, but we failed. We will collect ourselves for the bronze medal match and hopefully we can win a medal for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal match will take place on Tuesday at 7:30pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung overcame a partisan home crowd to edge out Enzo Lefort of France for a place in the semi-finals of the men’s individual foil on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lefort took control in the opening stages, with Cheung ending the first round down 3-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete was able to turn it around early in the second round, but the French fencer fought back, leading to a nail-biting back and forth that ended with the second round score at 13-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, knowing he would go out if he lost another point, scored two quick points in an intense final round to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, taking Hong Kong, China into the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When you fence against a guy who is a two-time world champion, who is playing in his hometown with all the public, of course it’s going to be hard, harder than usual but Ka-long found the psychological resources to put the last point, which is amazing regarding to the match, so I am very, very again proud of what he did,” said coach Gregory Koenig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to understand that even when you are tired, you have enough adrenaline to find the resources. You are tired but the psychological is the most important at this point. Even when you have pain everywhere, you have to think ‘OK I have pain, but this is life, this is how it is, I have to do what I know what to do’ and that is what he did in the last two points. The last two points were amazing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Koenig added that his next opponent Kazuki Iimura of Japan would definitely be a challenge, saying the Japanese fencer might be shorter than Cheung, but he moves very quickly.

    Djokovic downs Nadal in Olympic blockbuster

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Djokovic and Nadal of Spain embrace after their match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763742_1_20240729223953.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic crushed Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in their blockbuster Olympics clash on Monday as the two titans met for the 60th and possibly final time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The showdown between the two most successful men's tennis players in history appeared to be fizzling out before a late fightback from Nadal enabled him to avoid his heaviest-ever defeat by Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very relieved," said Djokovic. "Everything was going my way, I was 6-1, 4-0 up but I played a sloppy service game and gave him chances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic's 31st win in a rivalry that began on the same Roland Garros clay courts in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb added: "I never thought back in 2006 that we'd still be playing each other almost 20 years later."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal admitted Djokovic was the "clear favourite" ahead of their first clash in more than two years, with the Spaniard a shadow of the player who reigned for the best part of two decades at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 14 of Nadal's 22 Grand Slams have come in Paris, the 38-year-old has been plagued by injuries in recent years and he has slumped to 161st in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His participation in the singles in Paris had been in doubt until the last minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic has not had a good season by his stratospherically high standards but the 37-year-old Serbian rose to the occasion in his pursuit of an elusive Olympic gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed raced into a 5-0 lead before Nadal finally got on the board but Djokovic closed out the set and surged 4-0 ahead in the second before Nadal offered some belated resistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal clawed his way back to 4-4 only for Djokovic to break once more, this time making no mistake as he put away his old foe and perhaps brought down the curtain on one of the greatest rivalries in the history of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a bronze medallist on his Olympic debut in 2008, goes on to face Matteo Arnaldi or Dominik Koepfer for a spot in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will turn his focus to the doubles where he is in a dream-team pairing with compatriot Carlos Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the reigning men's French Open and Wimbledon champion, takes on Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor later Monday in the singles. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung advanced to the quarter-finals on Monday, after beating Mo Ziwei of China 15-10 in the last-16 of the men’s individual foil at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is ranked third in the world, started out strong earning himself an early three points to put him ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo was able to fight back, but Cheung maintained good defence to put him at an 8-6 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo then bounced back into the action, but he couldn’t overtake the SAR star, who won in two rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will play host France’s Enzo Lefort in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gregory Koenig said Cheung has to be prepared to face Lefort and a strong home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He has really the perfect mindset. He is self-confident, he knows he can be strong and this is what I want from him. Now as you can see on the table, he will have to fence Enzo Lefort, which is really the ‘chouchou’ of the French public, so it’s going to be hard,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be like in Rio against the Brazilian guy. He has to face off. If you want to become an Olympic champion, you have to face these kind of matches where you have to fence against one guy plus five thousand people of the public, but he will be prepared for this.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Monday flocked to shopping malls and government facilities to watch Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and other SAR athletes in action.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people were at a shopping mall in Kwun Tong to watch the live-stream of the Games on a giant screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the spectators was Valerie, who was there with her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really exciting, because there are people cheering when the athletes won or scored a point. I think this is really different (from) watching at home," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another spectator, Ena, said she was there to cheer on all the Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, their performance has been really motivational to all the Hong Kong citizens. Just wonderful to see more Hong Kong people step into the Olympics, like be the Olympians, and participate in such a big event," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, who was watching Cheung's bouts, said he was moved by the perseverance of the home-grown athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they are so hardworking. They put a lot of efforts on it. We should really support them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and star swimmer Siobhan Haughey are among those in action on day three of the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Sheng Lihao claimed the Paris Olympic title in the men's 10m air rifle event on Monday, adding to his victory in the 10m air rifle mixed team event along with Huang Yuting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sheng, the silver medalist from Tokyo, set an Olympic record with a score of 252.2 points at the Chateauroux Shooting Center.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm quite satisfied with my performance at the Paris Olympics. As you could see, I encountered some difficulties during the competitions, but I managed to hold myself together and complete them," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lindgren of Sweden claimed silver with 251.4 points. He came from behind to eliminate Miran Maricic of Croatia by 0.5 points through the second shot of the penultimate series, scoring 10.6 to Maricic's 9.9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite finishing first in Sunday's qualification round, the 19-year-old Sheng was not at his best, scoring 631.7 points, which is 6.2 points lower than his own world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he responded with a strong start in the final and dominated after three series in the elimination stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two perfect 10.9 shots gave him a 2-point advantage over second-placed Arjun Babuta of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Sheng's lead diminished to 0.6 points before the final series against Lindgren due to two sub-10 shots, he managed a 10.5 and a 10.6 to secure victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the third shooting gold for China at Paris 2024 from five events, and the country's fifth gold overall. (Xinhua)

 Olympic champion Edgar Cheung on Monday easily booked his spot in the last 16 of men’s foil individual event at the Grand Palais in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer beat Daniel Gu of Canada 15-5 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung went ahead by seven points before his Canadian opponent started striking back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he could not narrow the deficit and Cheung went on to win in the opening three-minute period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This was the plan. We knew this opponent is a strong opponent but I knew if Cheung Ka-long is at his level, he can defeat easily and this was the plan,” said Cheung's coach Gregory Koenig after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will take on China's Mo Zewei next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I really wanted Ka-long to keep focus, to stay focus on every point even if the score was very high difference, to keep focusing, to keep fighting to be fully prepared for the next match, which is going to be to very tough against Mo Ziwei,” Koenig added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gu said he treasured the opportunity to take on an Olympic champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is no point being mad or upset about it. I already knew going into this, I am not a favourite to win, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like to get beat by someone that good,” said Gu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was fun. It is always a learning experience so all the hits and points he gets on me, there is a reason why he is an Olympic champion.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two SAR table tennis players, Wong Chun-ting and Zhu Chengzhu, on Monday won their singles matches at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw, Wong beat Ibrahima Diaw of Senegal in a nail-biter in a round of 64 match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair split the first six games, including a marathon second game lasting 14 minutes in favour of Wong, 18-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong prevailed in the seventh and deciding game, 11-4, to make it through to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, I feel satisfied with my performance today," he said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it was tough, but there were also some surprises... My opponent was in form quickly and acted more decisively, creating a lot of big difficulties for me. So it’s a good thing that I quickly adjusted my game, and luckily I won the second game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Zhu's victory in her round of 64 match was a more straight-forward affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She swept Chien Tung-chuan of Chinese Taipei 11-7, 11-7, 11-7, 12-10.
