<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bernardo Silva fired Manchester City back into the FA Cup final as the Portugal midfielder's late strike sealed the holders' 1-0 win against Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's side were second best for long periods of the semi-final, but Chelsea wasted a string of chances before Silva delivered the knockout blow six minutes from full-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shaken by their Champions League quarter-final loss against Real Madrid on penalties in midweek, City took a while to shake off the gloom from the end of their treble bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were hampered by the absence of Norway striker Erling Haaland after he suffered a knock against Real, with Julian Alvarez unable to make an impact as his replacement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were bailed out by Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson's profligacy and Guardiola will hope the hard-fought success provides a timely lift as they chase a Premier League and FA Cup double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City face Manchester United or Coventry, who meet on Sunday, in the final on May 25 and will retain the Premier League title if they win their last six games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be City's 13th final in the competition and potentially a repeat of last year's 2-1 win over United in the Wembley Manchester derby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beaten by Liverpool in the League Cup final in February, Chelsea's wait to win their first domestic trophy since the 2018 FA Cup goes on for another season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a bitter blow for Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino, who has endured a difficult first season in charge and remains without silverware in England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The semi-final was billed as in-form Chelsea forward Cole Palmer's chance to punish his old club for selling him to the Blues in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guardiola said Palmer was asking to leave City for two years before he eventually joined Chelsea, where he has scored 23 goals in all competitions this, including 11 in his last six games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palmer, who scored four times in Monday's 6-0 rout of Everton, was a constant threat for Chelsea, but ultimately it was his team's lack of killer instinct that proved decisive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palmer's pin-point pass sent Jackson racing into the City area early on, but his strike lacked the accuracy to beat Stefan Ortega in a miss that foreshadowed Chelsea's fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jackson wasted a golden opportunity to give Chelsea the goal their dominance deserved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enzo Fernandez's pass split the City defence, but Jackson opted to go around Ortega rather than shoot and the chance was gone as Nathan Ake scurried back to clear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Playing with more purpose and quality than City, Pochettino's team threatened again as Palmer cleverly shimmied past Rodri for a low drive from 12 yards that was well saved by Ortega.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time lethargic City had failed to muster a first half shot on target since a game against Everton in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jackson, in the midst of a terrible debut season, was put clean through on goal by Conor Gallagher immediately after the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the much-maligned striker's shot was palmed away by Ortega, who clawed away a close-range header from Jackson seconds later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City finally tested Djordje Petrovic through Phil Foden's snap-shot, but the Serbian was equal to his powerful strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea appealed in vain for a penalty when Jack Grealish's arm blocked Palmer's free-kick, while Moises Caicedo was fortunate to escape a second booking for a crunching tackle that forced Grealish to limp off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grealish's replacement Jeremy Doku drew an immediate save from Petrovic with a near-post blast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doku's presence lifted City and the Belgian played a part as they stole the victory in the 84th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advancing with intent towards the Chelsea area, Doku slipped a pass to Kevin de Bruyne, whose low cross was pushed out by Petrovic to Silva for a close-range finish that deflected home as Guardiola punched the air in relief. (AFP)

    Former badminton number one Momota retires

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kento Momota in action at the 2024 Badminton Asia Team Championships. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749402_1_L_20240418110551.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time world champion Kento Momota said Thursday he is retiring from international badminton aged 29, ending a top-level career that never recovered from a car crash four years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Momota, who had already missed out on a place at the Paris Olympics, will play for Japan for the last time at the Thomas Cup in China later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former world number one will only feature in domestic competitions in Japan after that and not on badminton's World Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have made this decision because it feels like I have reached my physical and mental limit in trying to get back to being the best in the world," Momota, now ranked 52, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Momota was once badminton's undisputed king, winning 11 titles in 2019 and losing just six of the 73 matches he played that year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his life was turned upside down in January 2020 when the vehicle taking him to Kuala Lumpur airport crashed hours after he won the Malaysia Masters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver was killed and Momota needed surgery to repair a fractured eye socket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He suffered double vision and struggled to regain his previous form when he returned to competition after a year out of action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost in the opening round at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and fell at the first hurdle in four of the first five tournaments he entered the following year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was also hampered by injuries and saw his world ranking plummet as former rival Viktor Axelsen established himself as badminton's top player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Momota, who was embroiled in a gambling scandal earlier in his career, ended a two-year title drought when he won the Korea Masters in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Momota had targeted this summer's Paris Olympics but his national ranking was not good enough to earn him a spot in Japan's team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was banned from selection for the 2016 Rio Olympics for gambling at an illegal casino. (AFP)

    HK's Angus Ng thankful despite missing out on Olympics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton player Angus Ng on Monday acknowledged he was unable to qualify for this year's Paris Olympics, adding he was thankful for the support he had received over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng, 29, was trying to make his third Olympic Games, having taken part in the men's singles competition in the past two tournaments in Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a social media post, he said he took part in many qualifying tournaments and had tried to overcome many challenges on the road to Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes in life, you don't get rewarded correspondingly even though you've tried your best. Perhaps it is what it is in life," Ng wrote, while apologising for disappointing his "true fans".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not only did Ng thank his family, friends and fans, he was also thankful for his "haters" for toughening him up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng said "their mean comments", when he didn't play well, helped his sporting career and gave him resilience in life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player, who once ranked number six in the world, also said making the Olympics wasn't his only goal, and he would spend the rest of his career doing his best to brush up his resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng was caught up in a jersey controversy in Tokyo three years ago when some criticised him for wearing black. He ended up changing into new attire, and was knocked out in the group stages.

    'Can't put a price on an Olympic gold medal'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="World Athletics president Sebastian Coe parked controversy when he said track and field gold medallists at the Paris Games this year will receive US$50,000 (HK$391,677). File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749693_1_L_20240420002552.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World Athletics president Sebastian Coe's decision to award prize money to Olympic gold medallists was welcomed by athletes but has sparked a backlash from bosses of other sports.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Coe put the cat among the pigeons when he announced last week that track and field gold medallists at the Paris Games this year will receive US$50,000 (HK$391, 677).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the first time a sports federation will pay prize money at an Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total prize fund of US$2.4 million will come from the International Olympic Committee's revenue share allocation that World Athletics receives every four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the strongest criticism, the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) said on Friday the move "undermines the values of Olympism and the uniqueness of the Games".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One cannot and should not put a price on an Olympic gold medal," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of one leading Olympic sport, International Cycling Union (UCI) president David Lappartient, made clear his displeasure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we concentrate money on top athletes, a lot of opportunities will disappear for athletes all over the world," the Frenchman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really believe that this is not the Olympic spirit. The proposal was not discussed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not just the decision to pay prize money that annoyed Coe's fellow federation chiefs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ASOIF was neither informed nor consulted in advance of the announcement," it said, adding "it is important and fair to discuss the matter at stake with the other federations in advance".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What surprised everybody is that Coe took the decision unilaterally with one hour's warning to the IOC and zero hours warning to other federations," Michael Payne, a former IOC marketing director who retains close links to the body, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The view of the federations, not unreasonably, is that they have been thrown under a bus. What are you going to do only three months before Paris?" Payne said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coe, a double Olympic 1500m champion in the 1980s, said his sport had long since ceased to be amateur "so it is very important that the sport recognises that change in landscape".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement to AFP on Friday responding to the federations' criticism, World Athletics said paying prize money was "about underscoring our unwavering commitment to empowering the athletes and recognising the critical role they play in the success of any Olympic Games".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement said it was impossible to put a "marketable value" on winning an Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we think it is important to make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is," World Athletics added. (AFP)

    Scheffler dominates back nine to win second Masters

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scheffler celebrates with his green jacket and The Masters trophy. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748889_1_L_20240415080716.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Scottie Scheffler captured his second Masters title on Sunday, dominating a back-nine shootout for a four-stroke victory at Augusta National.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, who also took the green jacket in 2022, won a record US$3.6 million top prize after a drama-filled battle with fellow Americans Collin Morikawa and Max Homa and Sweden's Ludvig Aberg, who made an impressive major debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler birdied three of the last six holes to fire a four-under par 68 and finish 72 holes over the iconic 7,555-yard layout on 11-under 277 with Aberg shooting 69 to finish second on 281.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time major winner Morikawa had a closing 74 to share third on 284 with Homa and England's Tommy Fleetwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Did my best to stay calm out there and to be patient," Scheffler said. "They played well out there and I was fortunate to hold them off until the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler matched Tiger Woods as the only players to win the Masters twice while atop the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also became the fourth-youngest multiple Masters winner at age 27 behind Woods, Jack Nicklaus and the late Seve Ballesteros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, who hasn't played a round over par since last August, has the second-fewest Masters starts for any two-time winner with five. Only Horton Smith needed fewer, taking two of the first three Augusta titles in the 1930s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Well back were second-ranked Rory McIlroy, third-ranked defending champion Jon Rahm and 15-time major champion Woods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, who needs only a Masters victory to complete a career grand slam, fired a 73 to finish on 292.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spaniard Rahm fired a 76 to finish on 297.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods shot 77 to finish on 16-over 304, last among 60 players to make the cut in his worst 72-hole Masters effort. He said he plans to play the year's other three majors. (AFP)

    Jepchirchir, Munyao seal London Marathon Kenyan double

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Winners of the men's and women's races, Alexander Mutiso Munyao and Peres Jepchirchir. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749892_1_L_20240421232054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir won the London marathon in a women's-only world record on Sunday as Alexander Mutiso Munyao's victory in the men's race made it a Kenyan double.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The race was preceded by 30 seconds of applause for Kelvin Kiptum, 2023 winner of the men's race, who was killed in a car accident in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A poignant day ended with two more Kenyan victories with Jepchirchir in particular putting down a marker ahead of her defence of her title at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The field for the women's race was considered one of the best ever assembled with three of the four fastest women in history competing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old Kenyan came home in front of world record holder Tigst Assefa and Joyciline Jepkosgei to break the record mark without male pacemakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jepchirchir's time of 2 hours 16 minutes 16 seconds smashed the women's-only course record of 2:17:01 set by compatriot Mary Keitany in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retired British star Paula Radcliffe ran a time of 2:15:25 in a mixed-sex marathon in London in 2003, using male pacemakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was not expecting to run a world record," said Jepchirchir. "I knew it might be beat but I did not expect it to be me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am so happy to qualify for the Olympics and I feel grateful. I'm happy to be at Paris and my pray(er) is to be there and run well to defend my title. I know it won't be easy but I'll try my best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munyao got the better of Ethiopian legend Kenenisa Bekele to take the men's race in 2:04:01.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-time Olympic gold medallist on the track, Bekele was on course for his first win on the streets of London aged 41 but Munyao proved too strong in the closing kilometres to pull clear up London's famous landmark The Mall towards the finish line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At 40 kilometres I got some pressure from Bekele but I had a lot of confidence because I trained for this race," said Munyao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After 40 kilometres I thought I had enough energy to win. That's why I kicked and I knew I would win."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old also paid tribute to Kiptum, whose sudden death sent shockwaves through the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think about him and let him rest in peace. He came here in London and he won."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Behind the front two it was a great day for the British duo of Emile Cairess and Mahamed Mahamed as they finished third and fourth respectively to close in on a place at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A record number of people ran the 26.2-mile (42 kilometre) route through the British capital with over 50,000 participants taking part. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen rounded off a dominant weekend with victory in the first Chinese Grand Prix for five years on Sunday to extend his world championship lead a day after romping to sprint victory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time world champion controlled the race on its return to the Shanghai International Circuit for the first time since 2019 to finish 13.7 seconds ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris with Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was only denied a 100 percent points-scoring weekend when Fernando Alonso picked up the bonus for the fastest lap around the 5.451 kilometre track on the outskirts of Shanghai after a late switch to fresh tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another all-conquering display from Verstappen, who won his fourth grand prix this season to add to his sprint victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only a rare brake failure in Melbourne denied Verstappen the chance of a clean sweep in all five races in 2024, as he marches inexorably towards a fourth consecutive world title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It felt amazing, all weekend we were incredibly quick," said Verstappen, who recorded his first victory in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It felt amazing, it was so enjoyable to drive on every single compound. The car was on rails, I could do whatever I wanted to do with it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were fourth and fifth, George Russell was sixth for Mercedes with Alonso seventh after a late charge through the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri was eighth, chased home by Lewis Hamilton who clawed his way up to ninth from 18th on the grid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The points scorers were rounded out by the Haas of Nico Hulkenberg in 10th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's first Formula One driver Zhou Guanyu has been an enormous draw over the weekend as he made his home grand prix debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was allowed to park his car on the grid in front of the grandstands after the race and exited the cockpit in floods of tears to an ovation from the capacity crowd. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Eiffel Tower's countdown clock to the Paris 2024 Olympics turned to 100 days on Tuesday as preparations for the Games entered the final straight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia earlier in the day. It will reach France on May 8 in the port city of Marseille, after a journey on the three-masted Belem ship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All permanent infrastructures for the Games are now ready, and the building of temporary sites has started in Paris, notably on the Place de la Concorde.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers will count on the flame relay across France for the mood to swing in the country as the July 26-August 11 Games approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, a poll showed that, in France, 57 percent of people felt little or no enthusiasm for the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris 2024 posters were displayed in metro stations on Tuesday and some landmark monuments paid tribute to the upcoming Games, while the stairs leading up to the Sacre Coeur basilica were being painted with the Games' colours. (Reuters)

    Man City in charge as Arsenal and Liverpool both lose

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ollie Watkins puts a huge dent in Arsenal's title hopes with his sublime second goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748869_1_L_20240415022146.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa struck twice late on through Ollie Watkins and Leon Bailey to inflict a huge blow on Arsenal's Premier League title challenge with a 2-0 win at the Emirates on Sunday as Liverpool also stumbled in a shock 1-0 defeat to Crystal Palace.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Manchester City were the big winners of the day as the defending champions remain two points clear at the top of the table with six games remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal had taken 31 from a possible 33 Premier League points in 2024 prior to Villa's visit, but former Gunners boss Unai Emery derailed his old club's charge towards the title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Arteta's men were left to rue not making the most of their first half superiority as ex-Arsenal goalkeeper Emi Martinez produced a brilliant stop to deny Leandro Trossard the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Villa had shown their teeth as Watkins and Youri Tielemans struck the woodwork before snatching all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bailey ghosted in to meet Lucas Digne's low cross six minutes from time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Watkins then moved to within one of Erling Haaland's 20 in the race for the Golden Boot with a sumptuous finish on a counter-attack from an Arsenal corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa's victory puts them in pole position for a place in next season's Champions League as they move three points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a similar story for Liverpool at Anfield as Jurgen Klopp's men appear to have run out of steam at the business end of the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Reds have now won just three of their last eight games in all competitions as a glorious goodbye for Klopp is at risk of fizzling out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool had not lost in any competition at Anfield for 14 months prior to Atalanta's 3-0 rout in the Europa League on Thursday and suffered their first Premier League defeat at home since October 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eberechi Eze gave Palace a deserved lead on 14 minutes and only an incredible goal-line clearance by Andy Robertson denied Jean-Philippe Mateta a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool were much improved after the break but were guilty of missing a number of big chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Darwin Nunez fired straight at Dean Henderson, while Curtis Jones, Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota should all have salvaged at least a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not dumb," said Klopp on the ramifications for the title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The answer is pretty easy: if we play like we did in the first half, why should we win the league? If you play like in the second half, we can win football games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So if we can win football games then we will see how many we can win. We have to be around when the other guys now struggle, if they struggle."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the advantage has swung firmly into City's favour as they look to become the first side to ever win four consecutive English top-flight titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham's hopes of a fourth consecutive season in European competition were hit by a 2-0 home defeat to Fulham.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayer Leverkusen lifted the Bundesliga title for the first time in their 120-year history on Sunday, a 5-0 victory over Werder Bremen breaking Bayern Munich's 11-year stranglehold on the German top flight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen knew victory would secure the title with five games to spare, but there were no signs of nerves in a dominant performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hat-trick from Florian Wirtz and goals from Victor Boniface and Granit Xhaka extended their unbeaten run to a stunning 43 games in all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen's maiden title, coming after five second-place finishes in their history, keeps their dream of a remarkable treble alive while shedding their unwanted 'Neverkusen' nickname for good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With 10 minutes to go, the long-suffering fans began making their way to the sidelines and a few jumped the gun, storming the pitch with the match still ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen's players ushered the fans back and some obliged, albeit briefly, with the stands swiftly emptying on the 90-minute mark as tearful fans made their way onto the grass to celebrate with the players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen are now on 79 points – the best tally after 29 games in German league history – and are 16 clear of second-placed Bayern and third-placed Stuttgart. (AFP)

    French teen candidate for 2024 NBA Draft: report

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Zaccharie Risacher plays for French side JLB Bourg. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750067_1_L_20240423074755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French teen Zaccharie Risacher submitted paperwork to the NBA to become eligible for the 2024 NBA Draft, where he is considered a potential number one selection, ESPN reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  If he is top pick, Risacher would follow in the footsteps of another French teen, Victor Wembanyama, who has had a stellar debut season at the San Antonio Spurs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 6-foot-10 [2.08m] small forward, who turned 19 two weeks ago, told ESPN he made the move to achieve a dream as he continues a strong season for JL Bourg of Pro A, the top French league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has always been my dream to get to the best league in the world," Risacher said. "I've been putting in the work for this since I was a kid. JL Bourg has given me an incredible opportunity to showcase what I can do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risacher is averaging 10.4 points and 3.4 rebounds while shooting 39% from 3-point range and he plays tough defensively, often opposing a rival's top scoring threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risacher, whose father Stephane was a star in European leagues and helped France take a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, sparked JL Bourg to the EuroCup Final that they lost earlier this month to Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's NBA Draft is June 26-27 in New York. The top selection order will be decided after the NBA Draft Lottery on May 12 in Chicago, with the 14 clubs who missed the playoffs having a chance to land the top pick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama was the top pick in last year's NBA Draft and posted impressive stats of 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocked shots and 1.2 steals a game in his first season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the French playoffs upcoming, Risacher will have many more games and much more travel than rivals of the same age in his NBA Draft class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of things I can bring an NBA team," he said. "My number one strength is my shooting. Then my defensive ability after that. And lastly, my ability to do what's asked of me, using my versatility -- I can rebound, handle the ball if needed, finish above the rim, pass the ball." (AFP)

    Palmer scores four as Chelsea hit Everton for six

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cole Palmer takes home the match ball after four goals against Everton. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749063_1_L_20240416080945.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cole Palmer scored four goals to put Chelsea within touching distance of the Premier League's top six after a 6-0 win over Everton on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The England international has been a shining light in an otherwise disappointing campaign for the Blues and moved level with Manchester City striker Erling Haaland's 20 Premier League goals in the race for the Golden Boot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an eight-game unbeaten Premier League run, Chelsea remain in ninth but are now just three points adrift of sixth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand to come.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A demoralising defeat leaves Everton still perilously placed just two points above the relegation zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors were dealt a blow before kick-off as Dominic Calvert-Lewin missed out due to a hamstring injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His deputy Beto spurned a glorious chance to open the scoring when he somehow turned over Seamus Coleman's cross from point-blank range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palmer was not so forgiving at the other end as he made another case to be crowned as the Premier League's player of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palmer nutmegged Jarrad Branthwaite before exchanging a neat one-two with Jackson and curling home from the edge of the box to open the scoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Enzo Fernandez absent due to injury, Pochettino flanked Palmer and Jackson with Madueke and Mykhailo Mudryk for the first time in his starting line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton failed to live with the sharpness of the front four and Palmer was left with an easy task to head in his second after Jordan Pickford denied Jackson from a Mudryk cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England goalkeeper then had a moment to forget as he gifted possession to Palmer, who nonchalantly chipped his international teammate on his weaker right foot from midway inside the Everton half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast to Palmer, Jackson has had an inconsistent first season at Chelsea but produced an excellent touch and finish to fire in his 13th goal of the season on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palmer then converted a penalty on the hour mark to make it nine out of nine successful spot-kicks this season to take his tally for the season in both Chelsea and City colours to 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Academy graduate Alfie Gilchrist had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he blasted in the sixth after Pickford parried Ben Chilwell's effort. (AFP)

    I Am Maximus gives Mullins second Grand National

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 I Am Maximus added the Grand National to his Irish National win last year to give trainer Willie Mullins his second victory in the world's greatest steeplechase at Aintree on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paul Townend termed himself "a lucky boy" after he steered the co-favourite to an ultimately easy win in an Irish 1-2-3 with Delta World second and Minella Indo third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whilst Mullins won with Hedgehunter in 2005 it was Townend's first taste of victory in the historic race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What an unbelievable race and an unbelievable horse," said Townend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a bit surreal, to be honest. I ended up being first to the first and got to the Melling Road and he backed back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He got careful on the second circuit but I was trying to conserve energy. I didn't get the clearest run between the second-last and last."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "I had the ones in front of me in my sights and he responded like I thought he would."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Townend and Mullins add the Grand National to their Cheltenham Gold Cup success with Galopin des Champs in March but for the jockey this was vastly different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Gold Cups and Grade Ones are special but Grand Nationals are different. You need so much luck. I am a lucky boy." (AFP)

    FA Cup says no more replays from first round

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All rounds of the FA Cup will now be played at weekends. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749531_1_L_20240419015317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FA Cup replays will be scrapped from the first round onwards from next season as part of an agreement with the Premier League, the Football Association announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The FA had already dropped replays from the fifth round onwards and said the move to ditch them from earlier rounds had been agreed "in light of changes to the calendar driven by the expanded UEFA (European) competitions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From next season the Champions League will feature an extra 64 games, creating increased pressure on the domestic calendar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World governing body FIFA has announced an expanded 32-team Club World Cup for 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the English Football League (EFL), which oversees tiers two, three and four, said it would seek compensation over the "frustrating and disappointing" decision to scrap replays, which provided vital income for lower division clubs when they played bigger teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FA said all rounds of the FA Cup would now be played at weekends and there will be no Premier League matches on weekends set aside for the fourth and fifth rounds and the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teams from the third and fourth tiers of English football enter the FA Cup in the first round, with Premier League and Championship clubs joining from the third round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FA Cup qualifying rounds for clubs outside the top four tiers will still have replays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EFL chief executive Trevor Birch said: "This represents another lost traditional revenue stream for EFL clubs at a time when the financial gap between the biggest clubs and those further down the pyramid is growing bigger than ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will now be discussing the implications for EFL clubs and seeking appropriate compensation arrangements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes announced on Thursday, which are part of a six-year agreement, will also mean the removal of the mid-season break from the Premier League calendar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The English top-flight will start the 2024/25 season in mid-August to give players a consecutive three-week break, taking into account "expert advice from medical and technical departments".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of the new deal, the Premier League is "providing up to an additional 33 million pounds (HK$321.6 million) for grassroots football".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FA said the agreement would secure up to 133 million pounds per season in funding in total from the 2025/26 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FA chief executive Mark Bullingham said: "This new agreement between The FA and the Premier League strengthens the FA Cup and gives this very special tournament exclusive weekends in an increasingly busy calendar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer summer period also allows a much-needed player break before the start of the next season."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier League chief executive Richard Masters added: "Throughout our discussions both parties have been committed to enhancing the scheduling of the FA Cup, a hugely important domestic competition with a storied history."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FA Cup semi-finals will be played at Wembley this weekend, with holders Manchester City meeting Chelsea on Saturday and Manchester United facing Coventry on Sunday. (AFP)

    Scheffler leads Masters as Woods wilts at Augusta

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scottie Scheffler says patience helped him grab the Masters lead. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748810_1_L_20240414095625.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scottie Scheffler birdied his final hole to emerge from a packed leaderboard and grab a one-shot lead over Collin Morikawa after the third round of the Masters while Tiger Woods endured his worst major round as a professional on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, who used a back-nine eagle to get his round back on track, carded a one-under-par 71 on a firm and fast Augusta National layout to reach seven under on the week and in position to win a second Masters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a win, Scheffler would become the 18th player to win the Masters multiple times and the first to accomplish the feat since Bubba Watson in 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being patient out there I think is really important," said Scheffler. "Especially on a day like today. It was a frustrating day to be playing this golf course. It was so challenging."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morikawa, who is seeking the third leg of the career Grand Slam of golf's four majors, began his day with three consecutive was alone in second place after a three-under-par 69 that was one shot off the day's low round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Max Homa (73), who along with LIV Golf's Bryson DeChambeau (75) held a share of the halfway lead with Scheffler, was a further shot back in third while Ludvig Aberg (70) of Sweden was three shots off the lead in his major championship debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler had dropped out of the lead after a shaky start to the back nine where he followed a double-bogey at the par-four 10th with a bogey at the 11th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an unflustered Scheffler joined Morikawa atop the leaderboard with a 31-foot eagle putt at the par-five 13th where his approach shot looked ready to settle some 10 feet from the hole before it suddenly gathered speed rolled away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods, fresh off his Masters record-setting 24th made cut, began his third round seven shots behind the leaders and hoping his injury-ravaged body would hold up and allow him to move into contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Woods looked worn out from playing 23 holes on Friday and suffered an unwanted personal milestone with a 10-over-par 82 that tied the day's highest round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just hit the ball in all the places that I know I shouldn't hit it," said Woods. "And I missed a lot of putts. Easy, makeable putts." (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Top seed Iga Swiatek, took her Stuttgart winning streak to 10 matches. She won the tournament in 2022 and 2023. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749698_1_L_20240420034234.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one and defending champion Iga Swiatek took her Stuttgart winning streak to 10 matches on Friday with a straight sets victory over Emma Raducanu while Marketa Vondrousova stunned three-time runner-up Aryna Sabalenka to also make the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Top seed Swiatek, the 2022 and 2023 champion at the German clay-court tournament, saw off former US Open champion Emma Raducanu 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 in her quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old Pole needed just over two hours to defeat Raducanu who was playing in her first quarter-final since 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite her loss, there were encouraging signs of a return to form for the Briton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her two wins for Britain in the Billie Jean King Cup win against France last weekend followed by two victories in Stuttgart mark the first time she has won four matches in a row since her 2021 US Open title triumph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former world number 10 came into Stuttgart ranked at 303. Twelve months ago, Stuttgart proved to be her final event of 2023 before undergoing surgery on both wrists and her ankle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek will face fourth-seeded Elena Rybakina, who defeated Jasmine Paolini 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, for a place in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova reached her first semi-final since clinching the Wimbledon title last July when she stunned world number two Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sixth-seeded Czech came through 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 as the 24-year-old celebrated her first win over Sabalenka in six years after losing four in a row between 2018 and 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Sabalenka had been attempting to make the Stuttgart final for a fourth successive year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The powerful Belarusian crunched 35 winners to Vondrousova's 17, but committed 48 unforced errors compared to 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova crucially converted seven of eight break points while Sabalenka only capitalised six times from 15 opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova will face either third-ranked Coco Gauff, the US Open champion, or Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine for a place in Sunday's final. (AFP)

    No systemic Chinese doping, says Australian swim coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell says China is adamant about clean sport. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749950_1_L_20240422120145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell has rejected allegations of orchestrated doping in Chinese swimming, saying China is adamant about clean sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cotterell is working with China's top swimmers in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics and previously coached 1,500 metres freestyle world record holder Sun Yang, who is now suspended for a doping offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirmed reports over the weekend that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said it had accepted China's findings that the results were due to contamination and decided against appealing the matter, triggering criticism from top swimmers and the US anti-doping authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cotterell told the Sydney Morning Herald he stood by his swimmers "100%" and said any positive test results in Chinese swimming were not part of a state-run programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy to say I’m absolutely in support of my swimmers and dispute any suggestion of anything orchestrated," Cotterell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are so adamant on having clean sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's sad to see what this suggests or looks like. It’s unfortunate for everyone. I feel for the athletes here because of how hard they work now to eliminate the tag that was garnered in the '90s."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading coaches and swimmers criticised WADA and China's anti-doping authority over the weekend and questioned why the 23 swimmers' test results were not made public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cotterell said he understood if rival swimmers were upset and that the process could have been better handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It unfortunately allows that doubt to come out and to surface. I can’t prove anything, I just know the truth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he was also insistent that failed drug tests from contaminated food was a consistent risk in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(Swimmers) are not allowed to eat outside anywhere. When they go on a plane, they can’t eat the food," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports said the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), which is found in heart medication, months before the Tokyo Games started in July 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said after reviewing a television documentary and newspaper reports that it stands by its decision to clear the 23 swimmers to compete at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-doping agency issued a statement on Sunday following the release of a documentary on the cases by German broadcaster ARD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an earlier statement following initial newspaper reports, WADA said it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that the swimmers’ samples had been contaminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York Times reported that Chinese anti-doping authorities found the results of the tests were Adverse Analytical Findings but cleared the swimmers without any penalties after finding that the samples were flagged as positive as a result of contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Following WADA’s review of the documentary, the agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,” WADA said in the statement on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are equally confident that WADA’s independent Intelligence and Investigations Department followed up on all allegations received, which were not corroborated by any evidence; and thus, did not meet WADA threshold to open an investigation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said based on available scientific evidence and intelligence, “which was gathered, assessed and tested by experts in the pharmacology of trimetazidine (TMZ); and, by anti-doping experts,” it had no basis under the global anti-doping code to challenge the Chinese agency's findings of environmental contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry on Monday called reports about the swimmers testing positive "fake news".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe you will also have noted that the World Anti-Doping Agency has put out a very clear response," spokesman Weng Wenbin told a regular briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After an in-depth and detailed investigation of this incident by the China anti-doping centre in 2021, it was determined that the relevant athletes had ingested contaminated drugs without their knowledge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese swimmers involved were neither at fault nor guilty of negligence, and their behaviour did not constitute a doping violation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After an investigation, WADA affirmed the findings of the China anti-doping centre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that Beijing has a zero-tolerance position towards doping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We strictly adhere to the (relevant) global provisions and resolutely protect the physical and mental health of athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We uphold fair competition in sports events and have made active contributions to the global fight against doping," he said. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The unexpected Oklahoma City Thunder clinched the Western Conference top seed ahead of the defending champion Denver Nuggets as the NBA regular season wrapped up on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The youthful Thunder rolled past the playoff-bound Dallas Mavericks – who rested Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving among others – 135-86 to emerge from the trio of teams who went into the final day of action tied atop the West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks to the Thunder's edge in their head-to-head record, the Nuggets' 126-111 victory over the Grizzlies in Memphis wasn't enough and the Minnesota Timberwolves, who also had a chance, fell 125-106 to the Phoenix Suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Suns snatched the sixth and final automatic playoff berth and will face the No. 3 Timberwolves again in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In New Orleans, superstar LeBron James scored 28 points with 11 rebounds and 17 assists in his 112th career triple-double to propel the Los Angeles Lakers to a 124-108 victory over the Pelicans and eighth place in the West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defeat dropped the Pelicans out of sixth place and they'll host the Lakers in the play-in tournament on Tuesday, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the seventh seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Golden State Warriors, with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green resting, beat the Utah Jazz 123-116 to lock up the last play-in berth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They'll play Tuesday against the Sacramento Kings, who cruised past Detroit 123-95, with the winner of that play-in game earning a shot at the loser of the Lakers-Pelicans contest for the final Western Conference playoff berth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a bit less to settle in the East but the New York Knicks, fueled by 40 points from Jalen Brunson, edged the Chicago Bulls 120-119 in overtime to grab the second seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks leapfrogged into second place over the Milwaukee Bucks, who fell 113-88 to the Orlando Magic as Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo missed a third straight game with a leg injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Magic, led by 26 points and 11 rebounds from Paolo Banchero, avoided the play-in tournament, clinching the fifth seed ahead of the Indiana Pacers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers grabbed the sixth and final automatic playoff spot with an emphatic 157-115 victory over the Atlanta Hawks and booked a first-round clash with the Bucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Boston Celtics, already assured of the top seed in the East, closed the regular season with a 64th victory, 132-122 over the Washington Wizards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers, who also had a shot at second place, fell to the Charlotte Hornets 120-110 and finished fourth. They will meet the Magic in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Miami Heat, beaten by the Nuggets in last year's Finals, finished eighth after a 118-103 victory over the Toronto Raptors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Heat will take on the Philadelphia 76ers, who rested star big man Joel Embiid in a 107-86 victory over the Brooklyn Nets – in the play-in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner will advance to the playoffs and the loser will take on the winner of the play-in clash between Chicago and 10th-seeded Atlanta. (AFP)

    HK to host Fencing Foil World Cup
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will host a FIE Foil World Cup for the first time next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong leg, at AsiaWorld-Expo, will mark the last Foil World Cup of the season, with up to 400 elite foilists from 30 countries and regions coming to compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them are men's world number one Nick Itkin and women's world number one Lee Kiefer, both from the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition represents an important warm-up opportunity for homegrown Olympians Edgar Cheung and Daphne Chan before they head to Paris for the Olympics. Cheung said he's excited to fence on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot because we use to travel around the world to fence in the World Cup to compete. Now it is a good opportunity that we can fence in Hong Kong, and all the Hong Kong people can cheer for us with Cantonese, which is really touching," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's kind of like a training for me this competition to prepare for the Olympics. If I have any mistakes in physical or mental that I did not do good, I can now realise and I still have time to prepare and to be better, and even my coach can see what happens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicholas Choi, who was part of the team that won bronze at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said it's incredible for Hong Kong to host an international event and for many big names to come to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Back in my days when I was younger, there wasn't a lot of international competitions but now slowly and slowly, there are more and more happening. I think it is really good for the development, for the youngsters, and also for fencing, it's the first time for us in foil that we're actually hosting a World Cup competition, so I think it is a really big step for us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also think that we're also hosting the World Championship in two years. This would be a really good stepping stone for us to even prepare the World Championship in a better way so I think it is a really good thing for us and everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chan said she doesn't want to set specific expectations for herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this World Cup is pretty much the same as the usual ones and it just keeps my condition. There are many competitions to keep me at my best level, so I hope I can perform better on the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everyone in the competition is my competitor, but I just want to try my best, fence them and achieve better results."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal shrugged off the disappointment of their Champions League exit to move back to the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win at Wolves on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard and Martin Odegaard struck at the end of each half to take the Gunners one point clear of Manchester City, who have a game in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal's season was in danger of coming completely off the rails after a three-game winless run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Arteta's men lost in the Premier League for the first time in 2024 last weekend, 2-0 at home to Aston Villa, in between a Champions League quarter-final elimination by Bayern Munich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they bounced back to keep the pressure on champions City, who beat Chelsea 1-0 to reach the FA Cup final earlier on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arteta made just three changes from the side that lost 1-0 in Munich on Wednesday and it took some time for the sluggish visitors to find their stride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves boss Gary O'Neil claimed his side have been struck by the worst injury crisis he has encountered in his professional career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the undermanned hosts were nearly in front when David Raya was forced to turn Joao Gomes' powerful effort onto the crossbar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal had only fleetingly threatened before the break despite their dominance of possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they got the slice of fortune they needed to kickstart their challenge for a first title in 20 years on 44 minutes when Trossard's mishit shot clipped in off the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was little in the way of goalmouth action in the second period as fatigue took hold of Arsenal in their fourth game in 11 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, shorn of the threat of the injured Matheus Cunha and Pedro Neto, Wolves lacked the attacking inspiration to further dent their title aspirations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Odegaard made the points safe five minutes into stoppage time by catching Jose Sa out at his near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-placed Liverpool can move level on points with Arsenal when they visit Fulham on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the bottom of the table, Luton's hopes of survival were hammered by Brentford's 5-1 rout at Kenilworth Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luton's heaviest home league defeat of the season leaves the Hatters still one point adrift of Nottingham Forest, who visit Everton on Sunday in a huge clash at the bottom of the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today was a bad day for us as a club but the teams directly above us play each other and we will not be out of it this weekend. It's important we all remember that," said Luton boss Rob Edwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford realistically secured their top-flight status with a dominant display despite missing England striker Ivan Toney through injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoane Wissa struck twice before half-time, while Ethan Pinnock, Keane Lewis-Potter and Kevin Schade were also on target for the Bees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley are now within two points of Luton and three of survival after cruising to a 4-1 victory at rock bottom Sheffield United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the Clarets' five league wins this season have come against the Blades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley scored twice in two minutes just before half-time through Jacob Bruun Larsen and Lorenz Assignon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gustavo Hamer pulled a goal back for the home side early in the second period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But United are destined to head straight back down to the Championship due to their woeful defending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lyle Foster and Johann Gudmundsson rounded off the scoring to leave Chris Wilder's men 10 points adrift of safety with just five games remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't name names, but I think there were a few players out there who wanted to get out of there pretty quickly after the fourth went in," said Wilder. "You just can't have (that)." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zhang Weili beat Yan Xiaonan in Las Vegas on Saturday to retain the straweight belt at UFC 300, the first-time two Chinese mixed martial arts fighters have faced off for a UFC championship belt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang looked like she had almost ended the fight in the first round with a rear naked choke, but her 34-year-old opponent survived until the bell, looking unsteady as she got back to her feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yan had some success on her feet, but Zhang brought the fight to the mat as often as possible, dominating the grappling exchanges en route to a unanimous decision victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “She bounced back very quickly,” Zhang said through an interpreter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the same card, Brazil's Alex Pereira pulled off a stunning first-round knockout victory over Jamahal Hill to retain the UFC light heavyweight title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pereira waved off what looked to be a low blow from Hill before landing a left hook that sent the American sprawling backwards onto the canvas. He then pounced to rain down blows and force the stoppage at the 3:14 mark of the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I told everyone the whole time, he's a strong guy, I cannot go away from my strategy, and that's exactly what I was doing ... I was gauging the distance and the timing, and everything went perfectly," Pereira said in a post-fight interview in the cage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hill had won the title in January 2023, but an injury suffered playing basketball forced him to vacate in July and decorated kickboxer Pereira, a former UFC middleweight champ, took over the belt with a second-round knockout of Jiri Prochazka in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After coming through the fight relatively unscathed, Pereira said he would like to fight on the upcoming UFC card in Brazil in May, and that he had sustained no damage against Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In perhaps the most thrilling finish on the card, Max Holloway folded Justin Gaethje with a thunderous right hand to win their lightweight fight by knockout with one second left on the clock after a tremendous five-round battle. (Reuters/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The top three in Sunday's Beijing half marathon have been stripped of their medals, organisers said, following an investigation into the finish that saw China's He Jie controversially win.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Today the 2024 Beijing Half Marathon Organising Committee issued a decision on the investigation and handling of the men's race results," a state media report said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "The trophies, medals and bonuses will be recovered."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race's bizarre finish saw He cross the line first after two runners from Kenya and one from Ethiopia seemed to deliberately allow him to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were "punished" and their results cancelled, CCTV reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Athletics Association said earlier this week they had met, issuing a statement vowing to make improvements to the sport in the country. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia 76ers, fueled by 23 points from NBA Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid, rallied to beat the Miami Heat 105-104 on Wednesday and book a first-round NBA playoff clash with the New York Knicks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Embiid, still not back to peak form after missing two months after undergoing knee surgery, stepped it up in the second half for the Sixers, who trailed by as many as 13 in the third quarter in the NBA Play-in tournament clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Embiid scored 13 points in the second half, drilling a go-ahead three-pointer with 2:33 left to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lead would change hands twice before Embiid found Kelly Oubre Jr. in the lane for a basket and a free throw that put Philadelphia ahead for good with 36 seconds remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixers reserve Nicolas Batum scored 17 of his 20 points in the second half and came up with a big block on Tyler Herro with 26.2 seconds left, the 76ers draining a series of free-throws to seal the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory gave Philadelphia the seventh seed for the Eastern Conference playoffs and they will open their series against the second-seeded Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miami, who emerged from the play-in to reach the NBA Finals last year, can still make the playoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday they play a must-win game against the winner of Wednesday's later play-in clash between the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks, with the winner booking a first-round meeting with the top-seeded Boston Celtics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Heat will be keeping an eye on star Jimmy Butler, who was rocked by a collision with Oubre under the basket late in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Butler stayed in the game and finished with 19 points and five steals but was limping noticeably by the end of the contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Herro led the Heat's scoring with 25 points – 16 in the fourth quarter to help Miami keep the pressure on until the waning seconds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triple world champion Max Verstappen took pole position on Saturday for the Chinese Grand Prix, 0.322 seconds ahead of Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso third.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Verstappen clocked a fastest lap of 1 minute and 33.660 seconds to cap a perfect day after earlier winning the sprint race at the Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris will start on the second row in his McLaren alongside Alonso for Sunday's race, the first grand prix to be held in China since 2019 because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oscar Piastri was fifth fastest in the second McLaren ahead of the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, with George Russell's Mercedes eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a dominant day for the Dutchman who overcame electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the morning sprint, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win increased his championship lead over teammate Perez to 25 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Hamilton's joy at coming second in the sprint turned to despair in the first qualifying stint when the Englishman locked up near the end of his final flying lap, relegating him to only 18th fastest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time since the 2022 Saudi Grand Prix that the seven-time world champion had been knocked out in Q1. (AFP)

    Inter win Serie A in derby thriller with AC Milan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Inter Milan players celebrate winning the club's twentieth Serie A title. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750074_1_L_20240423081355.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Inter Milan won Serie A on Monday after beating AC Milan 2-1 and creating an unassailable lead at the top of the league with their sixth straight derby victory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Francesco Acerbi and Marcus Thuram gave Inter a 17-point advantage over closest challengers Milan and secured their 20th league crown with five matches of the season remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simone Inzaghi won the first league title of his managerial career on a cold, soaking wet evening at the San Siro where a clutch of Inter's "away" fans in the 75,000 crowd roared in delight at the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milan made a fight of it in the final moments after Fikayo Tomori pulled one back with 10 minutes remaining but Inter held out to kick off a title party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inter have become the second team to win 20 Italian league titles and will have a second star stitched onto their jersey, after Juventus who are way out in the lead with 36 league crowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The future looks bright as Inzaghi, captain Lautaro Martinez and Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella are all set to renew their contracts while smart work in the transfer market and increased revenue has helped mitigate significant financial harm wrought by the Covid-29 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piotr Zielinski and Medhi Taremi will arrive from Napoli and Porto as free agents in the close season while big stars like Marcus Thuram should stay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Off the pitch Inter's president Steven Zhang is trying to make sure that investment fund Oaktree don't take control of the club with non-repayment of an emergency loan – granted in 2021 – next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang is looking at taking out another loan with fellow US fund Pimco so that Inter can pay Oaktree loan and ensure that the club don't wind up owned by Oaktree as Milan did with Elliott in 2018. (AFP)

    NBA Nets name Spaniard Fernandez as new head coach

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jordi Fernandez, who guided Canada to a bronze medal in last year's World Cup, was named as the new head coach of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 41-year-old Spaniard, who had served as associate head coach of the Sacramento Kings for the past two seasons, will replace interim coach Kevin Ollie, who took over after Jacque Vaughn was fired in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're thrilled to announce Jordi Fernandez as Brooklyn's new head coach," Nets general manager Sean Marks said. "As we progressed through an extensive search over the past six weeks, it became increasingly clear that Jordi is the best coach to lead our team forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Jordi brings a diverse set of experiences and basketball knowledge gained over the course of a coaching career that has taken him around the world. Each step of the way, Jordi has consistently demonstrated the ability to implement strong processes and creative systems designed to optimize each team's specific roster."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez helped the Kings reach the playoffs for the first time since 2006 last year, although Sacramento was eliminated by Golden State in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kings were eliminated by New Orleans in the eighth-seed play-in game this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm truly grateful to lead the Nets," Fernandez said, calling it an "exciting and humbling opportunity" and added, "We will be fully committed to building something special for Nets fans and the borough to be proud of for years to come."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nets went 32-50 this season and missed the playoffs. Brooklyn has lost eight of 10 playoff series since moving from New Jersey in 2012, never advancing past the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with Jordi to build a sustainable winning culture in Brooklyn," Nets team owner Joe Tsai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez took over the Canadian national team last June and guided the squad to a 6-2 World Cup run, including a victory over the United States for third place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will still coach the Canadians at this year's Paris Olympics even with the Nets hiring, Canada Basketball said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez spent six seasons as an assistant coach with the Denver Nuggets, served as an assistant coach for Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympics and for Spain at the 2017 EuroBasket. (AFP)

    Liverpool out of Europa League as Leverkusen advance

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool crashed out of the Europa League after a 1-0 win against Atalanta that wasn't enough to overturn their quarter-final deficit, while Bayer Leverkusen's 1-1 draw at West Ham took the German champions into the last four on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Jurgen Klopp's last season as Liverpool boss, the Reds were hoping to give the German a memorable farewell in the final in Dublin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Liverpool had suffered a stunning 3-0 loss in the first leg against Atalanta at Anfield last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And although Liverpool have authored some of European football's greatest comebacks down the years against the likes of St Etienne, AC Milan and Barcelona, there would be no miracle escape this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Salah converted a seventh minute penalty in the second leg in Bergamo after Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross hit Matteo Ruggeri's arm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Klopp's men couldn't breach the stubborn Atalanta defence again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bidding to reach their maiden European final, Gian Piero Gasperini's Atalanta will face Marseille in their first European semi-final since the 1988 Cup Winners' Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fresh from clinching their first Bundesliga title last weekend, Leverkusen survived a scare from West Ham before advancing 3-1 on aggregate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the semi-finals, Xabi Alonso's side will play Roma, who saw off Italian rivals AC Milan 3-1 on aggregate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen won the first leg 2-0 but West Ham made the perfect start in east London when Michail Antonio met Jarrod Bowen's pin-point cross with a close-range header in the 13th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham eventually ran out of steam and Jeremie Frimpong struck in the 89th minute with a shot that deflected in off Aaron Cresswell. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New Orleans forward Zion Williamson has been ruled out of Friday's must-win NBA play-in game against the Sacramento Kings with a left hamstring strain, the Pelicans said Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Pelicans said an MRI exam on Wednesday confirmed the injury, and Williamson will be reevaluated in about two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williamson had 40 points and 11 rebounds before exiting with the game tied with 3:13 to play in Tuesday's play-in loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His driving basket had just knotted the score at 95-95 when he grimaced in pain and headed for the sideline, only to depart for the locker room shortly thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williamson, the top pick in the 2019 draft whose career has been hampered by a string of injuries, was playing in the first post-season game of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the Pelicans reached the first round of the playoffs in 2022, he missed all of the 2021-2022 campaign recovering from a broken foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also missed the team's play-in game last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner of Friday's game will advance as the eighth seed in the Western Conference and take on conference winners Oklahoma City in the first round of the playoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pelicans won all five of their games against the Kings in the regular season, with Williamson playing in four of those contests. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaden McDaniels scored 25 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves dominated the Phoenix Suns 105-93 to take a 2-0 series lead in the NBA playoffs on Tuesday, while Indiana roared back to beat Milwaukee 125-108 and square their best-of-seven duel at 1-1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McDaniels led a balanced Minnesota offensive effort that saw all five starters finish in double digits as the Western Conference third seeds moved to within two wins of a series victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was the Timberwolves defence who turned the game in the home side's favor, shutting down Phoenix in the second half to frustrate Suns stars Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A torrid night for Phoenix ended with Booker fouling out in the fourth quarter while the Suns also were handed an injury scare, with Grayson Allen hobbling off in the third quarter after rolling an ankle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means Suns coach Frank Vogel will have his work cut out for him when the series heads to Arizona for game three on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves will go into that fixture brimming with confidence after restricting Phoenix's offense to 42 second-half points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota scored 31 points off 20 Phoenix turnovers while the Suns took just two points from the Wolves' 14 turnovers throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Milwaukee, Pascal Siakam poured in 37 points to guide the Pacers to an impressive series-leveling win over the Bucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siakam finished with 11 rebounds and six assists while Myles Turner added 22 and Andrew Nembhard 20 as the Pacers claimed a deserved win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milwaukee started brightly, with Damian Lillard once again taking on the lion's share of the scoring duties in the absence of the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lillard's 34 points were not enough to keep the Pacers at arm's length. Indiana took the lead just before half-time and finally pulled away in the fourth quarter, leading by 23 points at one stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game three in the series takes place in Indianapolis on Friday. (AFP)

    HK athletes to perform their best: chef de mission

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chef de Mission for the Hong Kong, China delegation, Brian Stevenson, said he hopes to see Hong Kong athletes perform to the best of their abilities at the Olympic Games this year, adding he doesn't want to set specific expectations for the games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leading the delegation to Paris in July, Stevenson said the size of the team would be similar to the Tokyo Games, but the exact number of athletes wouldn’t be announced until after the qualifying process is over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We won't know until about June, or a little bit later than the middle of June, maybe even towards the end of June, because so many of the sports are still active at that time in the competitions as to who is going to go to the games, so we won't know exactly how many athletes we'll have," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Tokyo, I think it was about 45 [athletes]. I would anticipate a low of just over 30 and a high of, in that range, with a caveat - if my rugby boys win in Monaco, well we've got a very large team of over 100!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stevenson also said he hopes to see the government continue its support of sports, adding that free broadcasting of the Olympics to Hongkongers would definitely encourage people to get involved in sporting activities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Greek police on Monday made 60 arrests over hooligan violence that killed a riot officer during a volleyball game in December, the country's police chief said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Our commitment to combating sports violence is absolute," Dimitris Mallios said in a statement on the operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yiorgos Lyggeridis, 31, was fatally injured by a marine flare fired outside a sports hall during a December 2023 Olympiacos-Panathinaikos volleyball match near Piraeus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The riot police officer died later in hospital and stadia across the country were closed for several weeks after the death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mallios said a four-month police investigation had found links between hooligans and organised crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 150 people are suspected of involvement, Mallios said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 9th Hong Kong Games began on Sunday with an opening ceremony held at the Coliseum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheerleading, a wushu performance and skateboarding were just some of the spectacles kicking off the biennial sports competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Athletes from the territory's 18 districts entered the venue before table tennis players Minnie Soo and Ding Ning, wushu athlete Samuel Hui and badminton player Wang Yilyu took part in a torch relay, lighting the cauldron together to signify the beginning of the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau gave the opening speech. He said President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of sports for improving people's health and realising the Chinese dream.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The biennial Hong Kong Games is a major sports event for all Hong Kong citizens. This is not only a good opportunity for Hong Kong athletes to show their strength, but also an excellent platform to promote 'Sports for All'," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, the Hong Kong Games has entered its ninth session. I know that in the next two months, there will be more than 4,600 athletes competing in eight events and a total of more than 1,000 games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inter-district sports event runs until June 9, with competitions in athletics, badminton, 3-on-3 basketball, futsal, swimming, table tennis, tennis and volleyball.

    Forest call for release of VAR audio as row grows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ashley Young's challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi in the 56th minute was one of the incidents mentioned in Nottingham Forest's compalint. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750047_1_L_20240423031529.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest have asked for the VAR audio to be released from their three denied penalty appeals in a 2-0 defeat at Everton that sparked the club to call into question the integrity of Premier League officiating.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Forest issued an extraordinary post on social media soon after the final whistle at Goodison Park on Sunday saying they had "warned" referees body the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) that VAR official Stuart Attwell is a fan of relegation rivals Luton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest are just one point and one place above Luton, who are in the drop zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nottingham Forest has today submitted a formal request to the PGMOL to release into the public domain the audio recordings between officials during yesterday's match against Everton at Goodison Park," Forest said in a statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club has requested this be shared for three key match incidents - Ashley Young's challenge on Giovanni Reyna (24th minute), Ashley Young's handball (44th minute) and Ashley Young's challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi (56th minute).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We firmly advocate for the broader football community and supporters to have access to the audio and transcript for full transparency, ensuring the integrity of our sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PGMOL have been pressured into releasing audio recordings of controversial incidents earlier in the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referees' chiefs were forced to admit an error after Liverpool had a goal at Tottenham wrongly ruled out for offside as the VAR officials thought the goal had been awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Audio of other selected incidents has also been broadcast on the "Match Officials Mic'd Up" programme during the season, but the laws of the game prevent such audio being broadcast live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Football Association has asked Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo, defender Neco Williams and referee analyst Mark Clattenburg to explain comments they made post-match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest enlisted the services of former referee Clattenburg in February as a consultant analyst to fight in their corner after believing they had been on the wrong end of a series of contentious decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in his Daily Mail column, Clattenburg said: "One of these errors would have been bad enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Three was a joke, and that is why Nottingham Forest were left feeling victimised after another defeat in which zero big decisions went their way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Forest's public blast at the officials has been hit with a backlash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher accused the two-time European champions of sounding like a "fan in a pub."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Stuart Attwell and Anthony Taylor (the referee) have had an horrific day today, awful, and they should be rightly criticised for that and that could have real implications for Nottingham Forest," said Carragher, now a Sky Sports pundit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I get the frustration, but that, what I've just read there on social media, that's like a fan in a pub. That is embarrassing from Nottingham Forest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow pundit Gary Neville called on Clattenburg to resign from his role with the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If he sees those words go out, which question the integrity and essentially call a VAR official a cheat because he supports a certain club, then he's supporting what's being said and he would basically lose all credibility, I think, with referees in the game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win for Everton lifted them five points clear of the relegation zone with five games to play, despite being deducted eight points this season for breaches of financial rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest have been docked four points for the same reason. (AFP)

    F1 roars back to China after Covid absence

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Shanghai staged China's first F1 grand prix in 2004. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749093_1_L_20240416105539.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two years ago the Shanghai International Circuit hosted a Covid hospital, but this weekend it will stage Formula One once more as the sport returns to China for the first time since the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Adding to the excitement of fans, they will see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu drive at his home track in Formula One for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm extremely excited, in these 5,000 years of [Chinese] history there has only been one Zhou Guanyu," said fan Wang Xiaotian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai last witnessed an F1 race in 2019, before Covid and China's travel restrictions put a halt to almost all major international sport in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for the action-packed Formula One weekend – which begins with Friday morning practice, sees a sprint race on Saturday and ends with the grand prix on Sunday – sold out within minutes of going on sale in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma Qinghua, the first Chinese to drive an F1 car when he took part in a 2012 practice session, said the sport's return will have a "very good impact", especially on younger fans who did not have the chance to see their heroes in the flesh during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This group of people are very much anticipating the chance to witness a race personally," Ma, a pioneer of China's motorsport industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was almost exactly two years ago, at the height of the city's lockdown, that the Shanghai circuit became the site of a makeshift 13,000-bed Covid hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was just a few weeks after Zhou had his first grand prix drive in Bahrain, finishing 10th, but the pandemic delayed 24-year-old Zhou's home F1 debut until this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though he is unlikely to challenge for the podium, Zhou is desperate to put on a Shanghai show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't wait to give it my all, share the passion with our entire team trackside and at home, and start a new chapter of Chinese motorsport together with the crowd," Zhou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an opportunity to inspire and pave the path for future generations being interested in the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My country loves racing and has been waiting for this moment for years." (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750268_1_L_20240424074751.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Havertz and Ben White scored twice as Arsenal thrashed Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday to surge ahead in the Premier League title race and up the pressure on Liverpool and Manchester City.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The destiny of the title remains in City's hands as the defending champions have two games in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool have also played one fewer game than Arsenal and are in action at Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men's goal difference advantage now looks unassailable should it become decisive in the title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts flew out of the blocks and were in front inside five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard smashed in his 15th goal of the season at Djordje Petrovic's near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Petrovic redeemed himself for fault at the opening goal with two brilliant saves to turn away Havertz's low effort and a deflected shot by Trossard to keep his side in the game before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the floodgates opened once White curled in Arsenal's second after Chelsea failed to clear a corner on 52 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Odegaard's stunning through ball was then met with the finish it deserved as Havertz smashed high past Petrovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His next finish was more subtle as the German international fired in off the post from Bukayo Saka's pass for his seventh goal in his last 14 club games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A night for forget for Chelsea was summed up by a sitter from Nicolas Jackson when he hit the side-netting with just David Raya to beat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And fortune was also not on Mauricio Pochettino's side when White's attempted cross flew into the top corner from another sensational Odegaard pass. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.
  <br/>

    Snooker star Vafaei says Crucible can learn from China
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hossein Vafaei in action during World Snooker Championship qualifying. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749922_1_L_20240422081638.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's Hossein Vafaei said Sunday that the Crucible Theatre venue for the world snooker championships "smells really bad" and the tournament can learn from China where players are "treated like stars".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vafaei lost his first-round clash 10-5 to former champion Judd Trump and lashed out at the conditions at the arena in Sheffield which has hosted the event since 1977.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything's so – if you ask me if I want to come back here, I would tell you no way," said Vafaei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Forget the history, you want to go somewhere really nice as a player. You walk round the Crucible and it smells really bad. You go to other countries, and everything is shiny. But here it's completely different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The practice room – do you see anything special? I feel like I'm practising in a garage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Ronnie O'Sullivan has already suggested the world championship should be moved to Saudi Arabia or China when the existing deal expires in 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Look at the China venues, how fantastic they treat the players, a red carpet and an opening ceremony," said Vafaei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The players are treated like stars. But here no one looks after the players, before and after the match no one cares who you are.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they don't want to lose the Crucible invest some money, make it shinier, make it nicer, make it more luxury for the people. If they make it cleaner and nicer, people will enjoy it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Snooker Tour responded by saying "the Crucible is a historic venue and there are limitations given the size of the backstage areas".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added in a statement: "We work with the Crucible to make it as welcoming as possible for players." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden's Armand 'Mondo' Duplantis opened his outdoor season in stunning fashion on Saturday as he bettered his own pole vault world record at the Xiamen Diamond League meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Duplantis, the reigning Olympic, two-time world and European champion, cleared 6.24 metres at his first attempt at the Egret Stadium to improve by 1cm his previous best set in Eugene last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US-born 24-year-old entered the competition at 5.62m, clearing 5.82 and 6.00m before setting the new world record – his eighth in the discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Sam Hendricks finished second with a best of 5.82m, China's Bokai Huang claiming third (5.72).

    Knicks rally late to stun Sixers, take 2-0 series lead

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Knicks guard Josh Hart rebounds against 76ers guard Kyle Lowry. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750132_1_L_20240423121622.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New York Knicks scored eight points in the final 27.4 seconds to stun the Philadelphia 76ers 104-101 on Monday and take a 2-0 lead in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jalen Brunson's three-pointer pulled the Knicks within two points and after Josh Hart came up with a steal, Donte DiVincenzo capped a chaotic possession with a three-pointer – after missing his first attempt – to put New York up 102-101.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OG Anunoby sealed it at an ecstatic Madison Square Garden with a pair of free throws as the Knicks joined the Cleveland Cavaliers in taking a 2-0 lead in their first-round series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs led wire-to-wire in a 96-86 victory over the Orlando Magic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a crushing defeat for the 76ers, who didn't trail until late in the third quarter, when a Brunson layup gave the Knicks a 68-67 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Philadelphia's NBA Most Valuable Player Joel Embiid was clearly hindered late by pain in his surgically repaired left knee, but the Sixers appeared to have regained control when Tyrese Maxey, fed by Embiid, made a three-pointer with 1:09 to play that put the Sixers up 100-96.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyle Lowry added a free throw to give the Sixers a five-point lead with less than a minute to play, but the Knicks responded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson finished with 24 points despite connecting on just eight of 29 shots from the field. He added eight rebounds and six assists and Hart added 21 points and 15 rebounds for New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maxey, who skipped the Sixers' morning shoot-around because of illness, finished with 35 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. Embiid added 34 points and 10 rebounds but missed a three-pointer at the final buzzer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Cleveland, Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points and Jarrett Allen added 16 points and 20 rebounds for the Cavaliers in another dominant win over the Magic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs, eager to expunge the memory of their first-round loss to the Knicks last season, have posted two straight wire-to-wire victories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolo Banchero led Orlando's scoring with 21 points and Franz Wagner added 18. The youthful Magic will be hoping to turn things around when the series shifts to Orlando. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Max Verstappen overcame early electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in Shanghai. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749746_1_L_20240420130451.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen overcame early electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the Chinese Grand Prix sprint race on Saturday, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman charged past the seven-time world champion Hamilton's Mercedes on lap nine of the 19-lap dash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez was third after a thrilling battle with the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first few laps were hectic," said Verstappen after claiming the eight points on offer for the winner of the first sprint of the season at the Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The wind is changing a lot which makes it difficult to drive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once we sorted (the battery) out we were OK," Verstappen added as he extended his championship lead to 25 points over Perez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leclerc and Sainz ended up fourth and fifth after swapping places numerous times in the dramatic tussle for the minor places with Perez and Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aston Martin's Alonso came out worst as he went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris, having to retire his car on lap 18 with a puncture suffered in the skirmish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the first Chinese Grand Prix weekend since 2019, huge crowds turned out to see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu, China's first Formula One driver, make his home debut in his third season in the premier racing class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for Sunday's main race sold out in minutes and fans had plenty to cheer Friday when Zhou propelled his Sauber into the top 10 in a wet sprint qualifying session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started from 10th and in dry conditions for the race and moved up one place after the opening skirmishes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhou agonisingly finished just out of the points in ninth after being passed late on by Russell, who started down in 11th on the grid but made the most of starting on quicker soft tyres. (AFP)

    Ohtani breaks MLB mark for homers by Japan-born player

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani belted his 176th career home run to move past Hideki Matsui for most homers by a Japanese player in Major League Baseball on Sunday
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ohtani crushed an 0-1 pitch from Mets right-handed hurler Adrian Houser 423 feet into Dodger Stadium's right field bleachers to break a tie with Matsui atop the list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matsui, who was the 2009 World Series Most Valuable Player with the New York Yankees, needed 10 seasons in the MLB to put up 175 home runs. Ohtani has passed him in his seventh campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ohtani has five home runs this season. He had tied Matsui with a homer on April 13 and then gone seven games without a homer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In that span Ohtani was 11-for-29 at the plate, with three doubles and six walks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly I was just relieved I was able to just get it over with, I was just happy I was able to do that," Ohtani said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Sunday's two-run blast, Ohtani reached base twice more in the Dodgers' 10-0 victory over the Mets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ohtani, the 29-year-old ace regarded as the most talented all-around player since Babe Ruth, is in the first year of his record-shattering 10-year, US$700 million deal with the Dodgers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first campaign in Los Angeles began under a cloud after revelations that his long-time interpreter had stolen millions of dollars from him to pay off gambling debts to an illegal bookmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ippei Mizuhara is currently free on bond and under court orders to undergo treatment for gambling addition after being accused of stealing US$16 million from Ohtani, who prosecutors say is a victim in the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Ohtani is not pitching this year as he recovers from right elbow surgery, Ohtani is off to a strong start at the plate. He leads MLB with 35 hits and 11 doubles and a .368 batting average. (AFP)

    England spin great Derek Underwood dead at 78

    <![CDATA[<img alt="After his playing career was over, Underwood served as president of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the owners of London's Lord's Cricket Ground. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749024_1_L_20240416002947.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Derek Underwood, the most successful spin bowler in England's Test cricket history, has died at the age of 78, his former county Kent announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Underwood took 297 wickets in 86 Tests with his distinctive brand of brisk left-arm spin and was noted for being particularly effective on uncovered pitches, which were in use for much of a 24-year first-class career that ran from 1963 to 1987.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He famously bowled England to a Test victory over arch-rivals Australia at The Oval in 1968 on such a surface, taking 7-50 when a draw had seemed inevitable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Underwood made his England debut as a 21-year-old in 1966 and played his last Test in 1982.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Together with outstanding wicketkeeper Alan Knott, he formed a celebrated combination for Kent and England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Underwood, affectionately nicknamed 'Deadly', and Knott might have achieved even more success for England had they not each been involved in Kerry Packer's breakaway World Series Cricket of the late 1970s and a rebel tour of South Africa in 1982.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, Underwood's tally of Test wickets is 42 more than the next highest by another England spinner, Graeme Swann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After his playing career was over, Underwood served as president of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the owners of London's Lord's Cricket Ground, for an annual term in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Derek was an outstanding contributor to both Kent and England, winning trophies for club and country and etching his name in the history books forevermore," said Kent chair Simon Phillip in a club statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Watching Derek weave his unique magic on a wet wicket was a privilege for all who were able to witness it. His induction into the ICC (International Cricket Council) Hall of Fame shows the esteem in which he was held in world cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "An advocate for growing our game worldwide whilst protecting our sport's rich heritage, Derek also made substantial contributions off the field as well as on it, and he will be sorely missed by everyone at Kent Cricket." (AFP)

    Heat stun Celtics to level playoff series

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tyler Herro drives the ball against Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750456_1_L_20240425101427.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat unleashed a barrage of three-pointers to score a series-levelling 111-101 upset over the top-seeded Boston Celtics in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff duel on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eighth seeds Miami, playing without the injured Jimmy Butler, produced a battling performance to knot the best-of-seven-series at 1-1 as the teams head back to Florida for game three on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyler Herro led the Miami scoring with 24 points, part of a balanced offensive effort that saw all five Heat starters post double-digit points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the key to the Miami victory was their accuracy from long-range, with the Heat draining 23 three-pointers from 43 attempts compared to Boston's 12 of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Herro knocked down six threes while Caleb Martin added five in his tally of 21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston, meanwhile, was led by 33 points from Jaylen Brown, with Jayson Tatum finishing with 28 in a losing effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was all the more unexpected given Miami's 20-point drubbing by Boston in game one on Sunday – something Herro said had motivated the Heat for game two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We lost badly in game one and everybody responded tonight, and that's that's all you can ask for from a group of guys," Herro said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another trademark display of defiance from Miami, who are aiming to emulate their playoff run of last season when they reached the NBA Finals after entering the postseason via the play-in tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't even want to mention last year, this year is a whole new year," Herro said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We feel like we have a great group of guys. We're not fully healthy, but we have guys who want to play and want to be out here making a difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This playoff opportunity is big for everybody. We just love to compete." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal suffered his first defeat on his return to tennis after injury as he fell 7-5, 6-1 against Alex de Minaur on Wednesday in the Barcelona Open second round.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam title winner, back on court this week after three months on the sidelines, battled well but eventually crumbled against the hard-working world number 11 from Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal, 37, who missed virtually all of the 2023 season, is hoping to compete at the French Open in May where he is the record 14-time champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard, who has won the Barcelona clay-court title on 12 occasions, had eased past Flavio Cobolli on Tuesday in his first ATP Tour match since January, but said he was not favourite against De Minaur who has now won his last two clashes against the former world number one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It proved a far tougher challenge and despite showing flashes of his supreme quality on the court named after him, Nadal came up short in what he said he believes is his final appearance at the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian broke in the first game and tested Nadal with a series of brilliant drop shots which Nadal could not reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Nadal hit back with a break of his own in the sixth game and consolidated with a fizzing backhand for a 4-3 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Minaur broke to love to take a 6-5 lead as Nadal went wide and sealed the first set when the Spaniard pushed a shot into the net, winning the final 10 points as Nadal started to struggle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Australian broke for a 2-1 lead in the second set when Nadal could not return a powerful passing shot, and secured another break for 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Minaur wrapped up his emphatic second set performance with a third break when Nadal went long. (AFP)

    Lillard leads Bucks, Clippers and Celtics win openers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Damian Lillard drives past Indiana's T.J. McConnell. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749919_2_L_20240422112551.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damian Lillard scored all 35 of his points in the first half as the Milwaukee Bucks struck early in a 109-94 victory over Indiana in their NBA playoffs opener despite the absence of Giannis Antetokounmpo.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lillard's explosive first half included a 19-point first quarter, and his 35 points were a record for any Bucks player in any half of a playoff game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made 11 of 22 shots, including six three-pointers to stake the Bucks to a 69-42 halftime lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He didn't make a basket in the second half, but his teammates picked up the slack and the prolific Pacers offense was held under 100 points for just the second time this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton, chosen ahead of Lillard for the US Paris Olympic squad, finished with just nine points for the Pacers, who were led by Pascal Siakam's 36 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bucks followed the blueprint laid out earlier Sunday by the Los Angeles Clippers and Boston Celtics, who both got off to strong starts in convincing game-one victories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern Conference top seeds Boston raced to a 14-0 lead to set the tone for a 114-94 victory over the Miami Heat in the first game of their best-of-seven series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum's first playoff triple-double of 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists propelled the Celtics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Bam Adebayo led Miami with 24 points and six rebounds, with Jimmy Butler absent nursing a knee ligament injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clippers, with Kawhi Leonard sidelined with knee inflammation, led wire-to-wire in a 109-97 victory over Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks, who put up just eight points in a shocking second quarter performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James Harden scored 28 points and handed out eight assists for the Clippers, drilling six of their 18 three-pointers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul George added 22 points and Ivica Zubac scored 20 points with 15 rebounds for Los Angeles, who seized control early as Dallas and NBA regular-season scoring leader Doncic struggled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic would finish with 33 points and 13 rebounds and Kyrie Irving scored 31, but the Mavs were in too deep of a hole to escape. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James scored 27 points in a loss to the Denver Nuggets in game one of the first round for the 2024 NBA playoffs at Ball Arena.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The defending champion Denver Nuggets, powered by 32 points from Nikola Jokic, shook off a slow start to beat LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 114-103 in game one of their NBA playoffs first-round series on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets, who swept the Lakers in four games in the Western Conference finals on the way to their first title last season, continued their dominance of star-studded Los Angeles, who had dropped all three regular-season meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game was the finale of the first day of the playoffs, which saw the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Phoenix Suns 120-95, the New York Knicks beat the Philadelphia 76ers 111-104 and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Orlando Magic 97-83.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Denver, Jokic added 12 rebounds and seven assists, Jamal Murray added 22 points with 10 assists and Michael Porter Jr. scored 19 for the Nuggets, who used a 13-0 scoring run to take charge in the third quarter -- in which they limited the Lakers to 18 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James scored 32 points and grabbed 14 rebounds and Anthony Davis added 27 for the Lakers, who cut a 15-point deficit early in the fourth quarter to six only for the Nuggets to pull away again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mindset needed to change," Jokic said of the Nuggets' third-quarter resurgence. "I think for the second half defense was amazing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lakers coach Darvin Ham said the Nuggets' 15-6 superiority in offensive rebounding was key as Denver piled up 18 second-chance points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can't allow them to get multiple possessions," said Ham, who added that he still believed the best-of-seven series, which resumes Monday, will be a "hard fought" affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Minneapolis, Anthony Edwards scored 23 of his 33 points in the second half as the Minnesota Timberwolves thrashed Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns in their Western Conference clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against a team that also had their number in the regular season, Minnesota's Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert -- bolstered by a strong supporting cast - turned the tables.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everybody here knows that's my favorite player of all time," Edwards said of two-time NBA champ Durant. "That was probably one of the best feelings ever in my whole life, for sure." (AFP)

    McIlroy dismisses LIV report, pledges future to PGA
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="McIlroy had a disappointing result at last week's Masters. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749230_1_L_20240417094812.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy rubbished reports linking him with a move to LIV Golf on Tuesday, vowing to remain a PGA Tour player for the rest of his career.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A report in Britain said McIlroy – a long-time critic of the upstart Saudi circuit – was poised to switch to LIV in a staggering deal worth US$850 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland swiftly debunked the rumors in an interview with NBC's Golf Central on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I honestly don't know how these things get started," McIlroy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've never been offered a number from LIV, I've never contemplated going to LIV. Again, I think I've made it clear over the past two years that I don't think it's something for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  LIV has signed a slew of golf's elite since its formation, with Spanish star Jon Rahm the last big name to make the switch last December in a move reported to be worth around $500 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, who has been increasingly conciliatory towards LIV professionals in recent months amid ongoing negotiations with the PGA Tour over a merger, reiterated that he bore no ill will to golfers who have joined the circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the things I think I've realized over the past two years is that people can make their own decisions on whatever they think is best for themselves," McIlroy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who are we to judge them for that? But personally for me my future is here on the PGA Tour and it's never been any different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm here today and playing a PGA Tour next week and I'll play the PGA Tour for the rest of my career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy was speaking ahead of this week's RBC Heritage in South Carolina where he is among a star-studded field taking part following last week's Masters at Augusta. (AFP)

    Paris Olympics flame to be lit in its Greek birthplace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The 'Belem' carried out trade journeys for nearly two decades from 1896. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749066_1_L_20240416081623.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 100 days before the 2024 Paris Games open, the Olympic flame will be lit in ancient Olympia Tuesday for a torch relay stretching from the Acropolis to French Polynesia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For the first time since events for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games had to be toned down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, spectators will be able to attend the torch relay events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 600 dignitaries are expected at the ceremony on Tuesday, headed by Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ritual will see actresses in the role of ancient priestesses coaxing the Olympic flame into life with the help of a parabolic polished mirror in Olympia, southwestern Greece, where the Games were born in 776 BC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony is conducted at the ruins of the 2,600-year-old Temple of Hera, and sets off the Olympic torch relay that marks the countdown for each Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first relay runner will be Greece's 2020 Olympics rowing champion Stefanos Ntouskos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hellenic Olympic Committee confirmed Monday that retired French swimmer Laure Manaudou, who won her first gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, will follow Ntouskos as France's first torchbearer in Olympia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic flame will be handed over to Paris 2024 organisers in a ceremony at the all-marble Panathenaic Stadium, site of the first modern Olympic Games of 1896, on April 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On April 27, the flame will begin its journey to France on board the 19th-century three-masted barque Belem, which was launched just weeks after the 1896 Athens Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's last surviving three-mast steel-hulled boat, it is expected to arrive in Marseille on May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten thousand torchbearers will then carry the flame across 64 French territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will travel through 400 towns and dozens of tourist attractions during its 12,000-kilometre journey through mainland France and overseas French territories in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean and Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On July 26 it will form the centrepiece of the Paris Olympics opening ceremony on the river Seine -- the first time it has not been held in the Games' main stadium. (AFP)

    Feyenoord boss Slot leading race for Liverpool job

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Arne Slot led Feyenoord to their first Eredivisie title in six years last season. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750243_1_L_20240424011914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord coach Arne Slot has emerged as the leading contender to succeed Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager, according to British media reports on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slot, 45, led Feyenoord to their first league title in six years last season and won the Dutch Cup on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had been a front runner to take over at Tottenham a year ago before ruling himself out of contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky Sports, the BBC and The Times all reported that Slot is now leading the race for the unenviable task of following Klopp at Anfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Reds could face competition from Bayern Munich and Barcelona, who are also looking for new coaches next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite when Klopp announced his decision in January to stand down at the end of the season after nearly nine years in the role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim was also linked with the Liverpool vacancy but reportedly held talks with West Ham on Monday about replacing David Moyes next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season, but his side trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points with only four games remaining in this year's Eredivisie title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said his track record of improving players and a high-octane playing style, not dissimilar to Klopp's, is what is attracting the Liverpool hierarchy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp has just five games left of a reign that has transformed Liverpool's fortunes after decades in the doldrums and could yet go out on the high by winning the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool sit behind Arsenal only on goal difference at the top of the table, but Manchester City have the destiny of the title in their own hands as they are just one point behind the top two with a game in hand. (AFP)

    Basketball phenom Clark selected first in WNBA draft

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Caitlin Clark, who smashed records on and off the court in a dazzling US college career, was selected first in the WNBA draft on Monday amid expectations she will have a transformative effect on women's professional basketball.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clark, 22, was taken first overall by the Indiana Fever – a team that hasn't been to the playoffs since 2016 and that had the second-lowest attendance in the league in 2023 with an average of 4,066 fans per game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the University of Iowa star joining last year's overall top pick Aliyah Boston in Indiana, however, all that seems set to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In anticipation of her selection, the WNBA has already scheduled 36 of the Fever's 40 games next season for national television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before the draft the Fever had begun selling a limited amount of single-game tickets, betting that the basketball-mad Midwestern state of Indiana would be prime territory for "Clark-mania."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seats for games against Connecticut and Los Angeles sold out within hours of going on sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clark, whose fame is built on a foundation of on-court excellence that saw her eclipse Pete Maravich's 54-year-old all-time college basketball scoring record, was cheered by fans at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who packed the draft venue in anticipation that she would lead a star-studded WNBA class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She admitted she felt anxious as the minutes ticked by before the Fever announced their selection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've dreamed of this moment since I was in second grade and it's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of ups and downs," Clark said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I always just believed in myself... I told my mom before this, you know, I earned it, and that's why I'm so proud of it." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City moved to the top of the Premier League as lowly Luton were eased aside 5-1 at the Etihad, while Newcastle thrashed Tottenham 4-0 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Amid a gruelling schedule, Pep Guardiola could hardly have wished for a kinder fixture in between the two legs of his side's Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guardiola made six changes from a thrilling 3-3 draw in the Spanish capital on Tuesday and City seemed set for a stress-free afternoon from the moment they opened the scoring after just two minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erling Haaland's shot deflected off the unfortunate Daiki Hashioka into his own net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet the floodgates refused to open as the English champions had to wait until after the hour mark before making the points safe when Mateo Kovacic smashed in Julian Alvarez's cross at the edge of the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland scored five goals when the sides met in the FA Cup in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian had to settle for just one time this time when he scored from the penalty spot for his 20th Premier League goal of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ross Barkley netted a late consolation for Luton but they have just five games left to save their top-flight status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeremy Doku fired into the far corner after jinking through the Luton defence before Josko Gvardiol scored his second goal in a week after opening his City account in Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory takes City two points clear of Arsenal and Liverpool, who both have a game in hand, and are in action on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool host Crystal Palace at Anfield looking to bounce back from their shock Europa League defeat to Atalanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal entertain Aston Villa, who moved back into the top four without kicking a ball on Saturday thanks to Tottenham's trouncing at St James' Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only way is to win our games and put the pressure," said Guardiola. "We have done our job and that is what we have to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alexander Isak scored twice, while Anthony Gordon and Fabian Schar were also on target as the Magpies moved up to sixth and kept their slim chances of Champions League football next season alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle are 10 points adrift of Tottenham and Villa with six games remaining but have the far easier run-in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've just got to keep doing our bit which is trying to win every game," said Newcastle boss Eddie Howe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're hopefully returning to somewhere near our best and we've got to keep heading in that direction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester United missed the chance to move back above Newcastle after a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twice the Cherries led through Dominic Solanke and Justin Kluivert, but Bruno Fernandes struck twice to salvage a point for the Red Devils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth thought they had the chance to win the game deep into stoppage time when referee Tony Harrington pointed to the spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But VAR intervened to determine Willy Kambwala's foul on Ryan Christie had taken place just outside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the bottom of the table, Nottingham Forest edged one point clear of the bottom three after a thrilling 2-2 draw against Wolves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matheus Cunha struck twice for the visitors at the City Ground to deny Forest a vital three points after goals from Morgan Gibbs White and Danilo had put them 2-1 in front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford's first win in 10 games pulled the Bees seven points clear of the drop zone as Ollie Arblaster's own goal and Frank Onyeka earned a 2-0 victory over Sheffield United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley's chances of survival are fading fast after a 1-1 draw at home to Brighton left them still second bottom, six points adrift of safety. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United overcame an astonishing collapse to beat Coventry on penalties in an FA Cup classic on Sunday, setting up a second straight FA Cup final against Manchester City.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's men won the shootout at Wembley 4-2, with Rasmus Hojlund scoring the decisive spot kick after the teams were level at 3-3 after extra-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game perfectly encapsulated a chaotic season for Ten Hag's men, who are well off the pace in the Premier League and had a Champions League campaign to forget.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no hint of what was to come when United coasted into a 3-0 lead against their second-tier opponents in the London sunshine, with goals from Scott McTominay, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they have made a habit of tossing away leads in recent weeks and the match against Coventry proved no different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-half strikes from Ellis Simms and Callum O'Hare gave the 1987 FA Cup winners hope and Haji Wright levelled from the penalty spot in the 95th minute, capping a scarcely credible comeback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coventry fans taunted Ten Hag with chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning" as belief infused the massed ranks of supporters clad in blue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coventry manager Mark Robins famously played a key part in United's FA Cup final win in 1990, a victory that launched two decades of success under Alex Ferguson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his team's push to reach the Championship play-offs has faded in recent weeks and they travelled to Wembley as underdogs despite United's stuttering season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United, 12-time winners of the competition, settled early and took the lead in the 23rd minute after a fine move down the right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alejandro Garnacho fed the overlapping Diogo Dalot, whose cross went under the hands of the diving Bradley Collins and was tapped in by McTominay from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marcus Rashford forced a fine save from Collins late in the first half but United doubled their lead from the resulting corner, with Maguire heading home from Fernandes's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coventry, who scored twice in stoppage time to beat Premier League Wolves in the quarter-finals, struggled to make inroads against an organised United team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They looked brighter in the early stages of the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the wind was taken out of their sails when Fernandes's shot found its way past Collins in the 58th minute, courtesy of a deflection off defender Bobby Thomas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Hare headed over from an angle as Coventry continued to probe but they pulled a goal back when top-scorer Ellis Simms connected with a cross from substitute Fabio Tavares in the 71st minute after United's defence switched off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They made it 3-2 in the 79th minute when O'Hare's shot from just outside the box looped off Aaron Wan-Bissaka's back and over Onana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coventry's fans were now in full voice as their team mounted waves of attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Victor Torp hit a stinging shot from the edge of the area with five minutes of normal time to go, forcing Onana into a sharp save.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Coventry were still not finished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wan-Bissaka was adjudged to have handled in the penalty area and Wright scored from the spot to take the match into extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coventry looked the more likely winners in 10 long minutes of stoppage time but could not find a winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United captain Fernandes rattled the crossbar in the fourth minute of extra time when set up by substitute Amad Diallo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simms then smashed a shot off the underside of the crossbar as time ran out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coventry thought they had won it in the dying moments when Torp poked the ball past Andre Onana but a VAR check ruled that Wright was marginally offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Championship side drew first blood in the shootout when Casemiro's weak penalty was saved by Collins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But O'Hare and captain Ben Sheaf failed to convert, leaving Hojlund with the job of sending United through and he made no mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester City beat Chelsea 1-0 in the other semi-final on Saturday. (AFP)

    Olympians Cheung, Haughey named SAR's top sports stars
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool got back on track after their week from hell as a 3-1 win at Fulham kept their Premier League title bid alive, while Nottingham Forest launched an astonishing rant at the officiating in their 2-0 defeat against Everton on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp's side crashed out of the Europa League quarter-finals against Atalanta on Thursday after suffering a damaging Premier League defeat at home to Crystal Palace last weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Reds' hopes of giving Klopp a glorious farewell were dwindling but they climbed back into the title race with a much-needed first win in three league games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool are now in second place, behind leaders Arsenal on goal difference and one point ahead of third placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand on their two title rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next for Liverpool is the Merseyside derby at Everton on Wednesday, while Arsenal host Chelsea on Tuesday and City travel to Brighton on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp responded to signs of fatigue from his team in recent weeks by dropping Mohamed Salah to the bench among five changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Liverpool took the hint with a more cohesive display by the banks of the River Thames in west London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold put Liverpool ahead in the 32nd minute with a superb free-kick that flashed into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fulham defender Timothy Castagne levelled from close-range after Liverpool failed to clear in first half stoppage-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Gravenberch restored Liverpool's advantage in the 53rd minute with a swerving blast from the edge of the area for his first Premier League goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diogo Jota wrapped up the points in the 72nd minute, drilling a clinical low finish into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton took a giant stride towards extending their 70-year stay in the English top-flight in a highly controversial victory over Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Idrissa Gueye and Dwight McNeil scored the goals that took the Toffees five points clear of the relegation zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest remain just one point above the bottom three and were left dismayed at being denied three strong penalty appeals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club's official account on social media platform X called into question the Premier League's integrity by claiming the VAR official is a fan of relegation rivals Luton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We warned the PGMOL (referees' governing body) that the VAR is a Luton fan before the game but they didn't change him," Forest said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our patience has been tested multiple times. NFFC will now consider its options."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aston Villa tightened their grip on Champions League football next season with a 3-1 win over Bournemouth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa shrugged off the exertions of having to go to extra-time and penalties in midweek to book their place in the Europa Conference League semi-finals against Lille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unai Emery's men even had to come from behind after Dominic Solanke opened the scoring from the penalty spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morgan Rogers' fine finish just before half-time proved to be the turning point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moussa Diaby slotted in from Ollie Watkins' pass to put Villa in front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watkins was the provider once more for Leon Bailey to tap in to seal the points 12 minutes from time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory takes Villa six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spurs have two games in hand but still have to play all three title challengers Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool in their final six matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Moyes' future as West Ham manager looks more uncertain after they were thrashed 5-2 at Crystal Palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fresh from their shock 1-0 win at Liverpool last weekend, the Eagles scored four times inside the first 31 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Olise headed in the opener before Eberechi Eze's spectacular acrobatic effort found the roof of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emerson Palmieri's own goal made it 3-0 before Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice for Palace either side of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michail Antonio's strike and a Tyrick Mitchell own goal was scant consolation for West Ham as a miserable day rounded off a poor week after they were dumped out of the Europa League by Bayer Leverkusen. (AFP)

    Tsitsipas defeats Ruud for third Monte Carlo title

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Stefanos Tsitsipas says his third victory was more special than his first two title triumphs. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748864_1_L_20240415003741.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stefanos Tsitsipas completed a Monte Carlo Masters trophy hat-trick on Sunday, holding off Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-4 in a display of "ruthless" tennis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 12th-ranked Greek, who will return to the top 10 on Monday, also won the title in the principality in 2021 and 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsitsipas said a chat with his team the night before the final gave him the spark he needed against his Norwegian opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I told them I would go out and play fearless tennis and that's what I did. I couldn't let the team down. I wanted to make the most of it," said the 25-year-old who had stunned Australian Open winner and world number two Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I showed some unbelievable, ruthless tennis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsitsipas produced 30 winners to the 20 of Ruud who had reached the final with victory over world number one Novak Djokovic on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the fifth man to win three or more Monte Carlo titles, joining Rafael Nadal (11) and Bjorn Borg, Thomas Muster and Ilie Nastase who won three apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Greek struck first with a break in the third game of the opening set, then saved three break points to lead 3-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsitsipas earned a double break for 4-1 and claimed the set as Ruud double-faulted after 36 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the second set, Tsitsipas got out of trouble in a 13-minute game, saving three break points at 3-3 after leading 40-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He claimed the title three games later on a first match point, a forehand winner down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsitsipas explained that his 98-minute victory was more special than his first two title triumphs and cited a no-nonsense attitude heading onto the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is amazing, I want to thank family, friends and those who made this moment possible," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(Completing) the trinity (hat-trick) is even more special than the first two." (AFP)

    PSG punish 10-man Barca, Dortmund sink Atletico

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kylian Mbappe celebrates scoring PSG's third goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749228_1_L_20240417093454.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappe struck twice as Paris Saint-Germain battled back to beat 10-man Barcelona 4-1 and book a place in the Champions League semi-finals with a 6-4 aggregate triumph on Tuesday, while Borussia Dortmund fought back to beat Atletico Madrid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  PSG's hopes of going all the way in Europe's elite club competition for the first time hung in the balance after they lost 3-2 at home to Barca in the first leg of their quarter-final last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they seized the opportunity given to them in Catalonia after Ronald Araujo's red card left Barcelona to play over an hour with 10 men, allowing Luis Enrique's team to go on and win 4-1 on the night and 6-4 on aggregate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG were rampant with the extra player, as Ousmane Dembele again stood out against his old team by scoring the equaliser on the night and winning a penalty which Kylian Mbappe converted to put PSG ahead in the tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In between, the outstanding Vitinha – who had already scored in the first leg – netted with a brilliant strike from outside the box, and Mbappe made sure of the win late on to spark wild celebrations in the away contingent at Montjuic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final scoreline was identical to that on their last visit to Barcelona in February 2021, when Mbappe hit a hat-trick in the first leg of a last-16 tie they eventually won 5-2 on aggregate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the manner of this victory surely finally exorcises the ghost of their humiliating collapse in Barcelona in 2017, when they won 4-0 at home in the first leg only to lose 6-1 in the return in a stunning implosion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borussia Dortmund beat Atletico Madrid 4-2 in their quarter-final second leg, securing a 5-4 aggregate victory and a first Champions League semi-final since 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, goals from Julian Brandt and Ian Maatsen had Dortmund 2-0 up at half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visiting coach Diego Simeone made three changes at half-time including bringing on Angel Correa and his energy told immediately, Mats Hummels conceding a poor own goal before the Argentine netted to put Atletico back ahead in the tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But those goals brought a sluggish Dortmund back to life, with Niclas Fuellkrug and Marcel Sabitzer each scoring in a three-minute period to send the Bundesliga club through. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Kewell's Yokohama F-Marinos set up an Asian Champions League final showdown with Al Ain after beating Ulsan Hyundai 5-4 on penalties to win a pulsating semi-final on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trailing 1-0 from last week's first leg in South Korea, Yokohama scored three goals in the opening 30 minutes of the return fixture in Japan but then conceded twice and had a man sent off before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game finished 3-3 on aggregate after extra time in constant driving rain, before goalkeeper William Popp saved from Ulsan's Kim Min-woo in the shoot-out to hand Yokohama the advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carlos Eduardo converted the decisive spot-kick to send Yokohama, who former Liverpool and Leeds forward Kewell took over as coach at the start of the year, into their first Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ulsan, who had already booked their place in next year's 32-team Club World Cup in the United States by winning the semi-final first leg, were looking for their third Champions League title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama will host Al Ain in the first leg of the final on May 11, with the return being held in the United Arab Emirates on May 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al Ain beat Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 5-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to reach the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama made a blistering start and took the lead in the 13th minute when a defensive mix-up between Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Seok-ho allowed Asahi Uenaka to streak through and score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yokohama looked capable of scoring more and it was little surprise when Anderson Lopes added a second in the 21st minute, firing home a left-foot shot from just inside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home side kept up the pressure and Uenaka notched his second of the game on the half-hour mark when he slipped his marker and curled a shot past goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just as it looked like turning into a rout, Ulsan hit back when Matheus Sales headed home direct from a corner in the 35th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes later, Ulsan had a penalty and Yokohama were reduced to 10 men when Takumi Kamijima was red-carded for a handball as he slid in to make a tackle.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid exacted revenge on Manchester City to reach the Champions League semi-finals 4-3 on penalties after withstanding a barrage at the Etihad on Wednesday, and will face Bayern Munich in the last four after the German giants beat Arsenal 3-2 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rodrygo gave Real early lead before Kevin De Bruyne hit back for the holders to leave the match level at 1-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, City's defence of the competition came to an end after Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic saw spot-kicks saved by Madrid's unlikely hero Andriy Lunin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian, who has deputised this season for the injured Thibaut Courtois, had been at fault for City's early opener in a thrilling first leg but more than made amends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City had not lost at home in the Champions League since 2018 but the holders were held at bay by a heroic defensive effort by the 14-time European champions despite having 34 attempts on goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so difficult. They are continuously probing with the ball and move you around. Most teams would fall apart when City get on top of you but we stood up really well," said Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today it came down to mentality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In other sports for the stats we would win but football is like this and it's marvellous," said Guardiola.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Congratulations to Madrid because their capacity to resist and defend till the end, they did so fantastically. We didn't manage to score in the final pass or final shot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 63rd-minute Joshua Kimmich header gave Bayern Munich a 1-0 win over Arsenal in their quarter final second leg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 3-2 aggregate quarter-final victory means Bayern return to the last-four for the first time since winning the title in 2020. (AFP)
