<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand captain Sam Cane will retire from Test rugby at the end of 2024, the side said Monday, calling time on a World Cup winning 12-year international career.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Having played 95 Tests -- 27 as captain -- the 32-year-old has decided to focus on spending more time with family and sign a long-term contract with Suntory Goliath in Tokyo," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His retirement is not a complete surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks haven't played since they were defeated in the Rugby World Cup final by South Africa last year and Cane was already on a sabbatical in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane won the World Cup with New Zealand in 2015 and has twice been part of Super Rugby championship-winning sides with the Waikato Chiefs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his experience since taking over as All Blacks captain from Kieran Read in 2020 was not always smooth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane at times struggled with his own form and was sent off during last year's Rugby World Cup final in the 28th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With talents such as of Ardie Savea and Dalton Papalii snapping at his heels, there had been calls for him to be dropped from the side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his tenure New Zealand lost a first Test series at home to Ireland in 2022 and a few weeks later suffered a shock defeat to Argentina in Christchurch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane will return to New Zealand at the end of the current Japanese club season and will be eligible to be selected for the All Blacks for the rest of 2024, but will no longer be captain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's part of the natural process that happens in rugby," Cane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had my time as captain and it was a huge honour and privilege." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The defending champion Denver Nuggets outgunned the Minnesota Timberwolves 115-107 to level their NBA playoff series on Sunday as the Indiana Pacers pulled even with the New York Knicks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets, fueled by 35 points from NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon's 27 points on ruthlessly efficient 11-of-12 shooting and 19 points from Jamal Murray, claimed a second straight win in Minneapolis to knot their best-of-seven Western Conference semi-final series at two games apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers dismantled the Knicks 121-89 in Indianapolis to level their Eastern Conference semi-final at 2-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets withstood a 44-point performance from Anthony Edwards, but the Timberwolves star just didn't have enough scoring support despite an energetic effort from the hosts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards' dunk with less than a minute left in the first half cut what had been a 16-point deficit to seven.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic then came up with a steal and fed Michael Porter Jr. for a dunk and Murray grabbed a steal, turned and unleashed a buzzer-beating shot from beyond the halfcourt line that swished through and sent the Nuggets into the break with a 64-49 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray scored 12 points in the third quarter to keep the Nuggets in control as early foul trouble sent Jokic to the bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic returned to score 16 in the fourth and the Nuggets kept the Timberwolves at bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indianapolis, the Pacers finally got their high-octane offence firing. After the first two games of the series came down to the final minutes the Pacers fashioned a blow-out as a raft of injuries at last caught up with the weary Knicks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 20 points and the Pacers connected on 56.8 percent of their shots, drilling 14 three-pointers and dominating in the paint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  T.J. McConnell scored 15 points off the bench for Indiana, who had six players score in double figures. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zhang Zhizhen advanced to the fourth round of the ATP Rome Open after a convincing 6-2, 6-4 win over American Ben Shelton, on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang managed to save two break points and had four unforced errors compared to Shelton's 15, as he dispatched the 12th seed in 71 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ranked 56th globally, Zhang is set to face Brazilian qualifier Thiago Monteiro next. Monteiro progressed after a closely contested match against Serbia's 31st seed, Miomir Kecmanovic, winning 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 [6].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang's showing in Rome so far marks an improvement for the 27-year-old, who faced first-round exits in his previous two clay tournaments in Barcelona and Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Number 3 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany had a better day than Shelton. Zverev smashed 12 aces and advanced past Italy's Luciano Darderi 7-6 [3], 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also moving to the fourth round of the clay-court event was eighth-seeded Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, who defeated qualifier Terence Atmane of France 7-6 [3], 6-3 in one hour, 44 minutes. Dimitrov will be making his fourth appearance in the fourth round but first since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next up for Dimitrov will be 11th-seeded Taylor Fritz, who knocked out 24th-seeded Sebastian Korda 6-3, 6-4 in an All-American clash. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rose Zhang produced a scintillating late rally to sweep past Madelene Sagstrom and claim her second professional title with victory at the LPGA Founders Cup in New Jersey on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old from California rattled off four birdies in her final five holes to card a six-under par 66 to finish on 24-under, two shots clear of Sweden's Sagstrom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In cool, overcast conditions at the Upper Montclair Country Club in Clifton, overnight leader Sagstrom had looked to be cruising to victory after rolling in her fifth birdie of the day on the 12th to go three shots clear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagstrom retained that hefty three-shot cushion after parring the 13th along with Zhang, who gave no clue of the pyrotechnics to follow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang pulled a shot back with a birdie on the par-five 14th, and then got to within one after a superb tee-shot set up a birdie chance on the par-three 15th which she converted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the pressure building, Sagstrom then cracked on the 16th, under-hitting a chip onto the green which left her a long par putt that she missed to card a bogey five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left Zhang as co-leader and the youngster duly seized her chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another dazzling tee-shot on the par-three 17th left her a three-foot putt for birdie which she rolled in to move one shot clear, and then she sealed victory on 18 with a nerveless birdie putt from 10 feet. (AFP)

    Arsenal beat United to go back on top - for now

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal kept their Premier League title dreams alive by ending an Old Trafford hoodoo to grind out a 1-0 win at Manchester United on Sunday to move back top of the table.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard scored the only goal on 20 minutes as Arsenal won for just the second time in 17 games away at United to go a point clear at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester City still have the destiny of the title in their own hands as the defending champions have two matches left to Arsenal's one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Gunners kept the pressure on Pep Guardiola's men ahead of their tricky trip to Tottenham on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat further dented United's chances of competing in Europe next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's men showed more spirit than in a dismal 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday, but have now won just one of their last eight Premier League games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United remain eighth in the table, three points adrift of both Newcastle, who they face on Wednesday, and Chelsea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have been in scintillating form in 2024 to remain in the race for their first league title in 20 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Arteta's men have won 15 and drawn one of their 17 league games since the turn of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Arsenal were far from their flowing best as the expected onslaught of an injury-ravaged United never materialised under unusually stifling heat in England's north-west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The manner of defeat at Palace had increased the scrutiny on United boss Ten Hag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made three changes to the team swept aside at Selhurst Park as Scott McTominay, Sofyan Amrabat and Amad Diallo came in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman's options were again hamstrung by a lengthy list of absentees with captain Bruno Fernandes among those sidelined and a bench littered with youngsters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his decision to retain Casemiro as a makeshift centre-back after his woeful showing against Palace will become another stick to beat the beleaguered coach with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazil captain was dropped from their squad for the Copa America in midweek due to his terrible form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After United had managed to keep the free-scoring visitors at bay for the opening 20 minutes, Casemiro was culpable for the opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old was laboured in pushing up from a United goal-kick to play Kai Havertz onside and Trossard then stole in on the blind side of Casemiro to tap in the German's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance at Old Trafford rather than at Wembley to see the club's women pick up their first ever major trophy in the FA Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The work that lies ahead of Ratcliffe has been laid bare in recent weeks, but the home side did manage to keep the majority of the 74,000 crowd onside by taking the game to Arsenal after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal, though, were rarely seriously troubled as they held out for a sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United won the Women's FA Cup for the first time with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Marc Skinner's side, who lost in last year's final to Chelsea, dominated the match and went ahead on the stroke of halftime through a stunning strike from midfielder Ella Toone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A header from Rachel Williams and two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia after the break sealed the first major trophy for United since the team reformed in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing," said goalkeeper Mary Earps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The atmosphere was buzzing on a sunny day at Wembley Stadium with 76,082 fans in attendance along with United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the first half produced few chances of note until the second minute of stoppage time when England's Toone drove the ball forward and unleashed a powerful strike from outside the area into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spurs, playing in their first FA Cup final, drew 2-2 with United in the Women's Super League last month but struggled to create any attacking threat, not registering a single shot on target, and capitulated after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's Williams, who previously played for Spurs and won the FA Cup with Birmingham City 12 years ago, climbed high to head in a free kick before Garcia pounced on a poor pass from goalkeeper Becky Spencer to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garcia added another via a deflection in the 74th as United salvaged a season in which they have struggled, sitting fifth in the league standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had," goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. "We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to have change things next year. We have had some injuries, three or four ACLs, at the start of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's football, teams go through transition. You have a good year, you have a dip. Next year we might just come back bigger, better and stronger and, who knows, we might just be lifting the league." (Reuters)

    Chiliean Alejandro Tabilo stuns Novak Djokovic

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752869_1_20240512224302.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic was knocked out of the Rome Open in the third round on Sunday by Alejandro Tabilo in a surprise 6-2, 6-3 defeat for the 24-time Grand Slam champion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title was ended in just over an hour by Chilean Tabilo, who is ranked 32nd in the world but was hugely impressive and claimed his first win over a top-10 opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old was eliminated two days after being accidentally being struck on the head by a bottle following his straightforward second-round win over Corentin Moutet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And his subdued performance on a court where he has won six titles suggested he may have still been suffering from that blow, even if he laughed it off by wearing a cycling crash helmet to practice on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic's early elimination is a blow for the last major tournament before Roland Garros later this month, which started without Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home fans have also been deprived of cheering on former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Musetti, while Djokovic's great clay-court rival Nadal, a big crowd favourite, was dumped out in the second round on Saturday by seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tabilo was a worthy winner after tearing into his superstar opponent, racing into a 4-0 lead in the first set in less than 20 minutes, breaking Djokovic twice and surprising the Serb with a series of impressive winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chilean claimed the opening set in half an hour, leaving fans sat under the baking Rome sunshine stunned at the off-form Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He immediately broke Djokovic for the third time in the opening game of the second set and went on to claim the biggest win of his career in remarkable style. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal said on Saturday that he is leaning towards playing at the French Open despite his second-round elimination in Rome, as Novak Djokovic laughed off being hit by a bottle which briefly cast doubt on his continued participation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clay-court icon Nadal had previously said that he would only play at the French Open, where he has won a record 14 titles, if he feels competitive after a raft of injury problems over the last two years which have left him languishing 305th in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the manner of his elimination in his first ever encounter with Hubert Hurkacz - winner in straight sets 6-1, 6-3 - seemed a step backwards after reaching the last 16 in Madrid, leaving a question mark hanging over his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The decision, as you can imagine, is not clear in my mind today. But if I have to say what's my feeling and if my mind is closer one way or the other way, I am going to say to be in Roland Garros and try my best," Nadal told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Physically I have some issues, but not probably yet enough to say I'm not playing in the most important event of my tennis career. Let's see what's going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal held his own in the first two games in the first set, which took 26 minutes to complete, but then quickly fell away, Hurkacz winning without dropping a service game and seemingly without breaking a sweat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That level of dominance over Nadal on clay, much less a court where he has won a record 10 titles, would have been unimaginable a few short years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hurkacz will face Tomas Etcheverry in the third round after likely ending Nadal's love affair with Rome as the 22-time Grand Slam winner said that he was "98 percent" sure that he would never again grace the Roman clay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No-one will ever have a record like him on this surface. He's just bigger than the sport at the end of the day," said Hurkacz. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752804_1_20240512011419.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City hit the top of the Premier League with one week of the season remaining as two goals by Josko Gvardiol and one each for Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez sealed a 4-0 demolition of Fulham on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Burnley were relegated from the Premier League after a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur left Vincent Kompany's side five points from the safety zone with one game remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City's stroll in the London sunshine, their seventh successive league win and 16th consecutive victory over Fulham in all competitions, moved Pep Guardiola's a step closer an unprecedented fourth English title in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have 85 points from 36 games, with Arsenal on 83 from 36. Arsenal can regain top spot by beating Manchester United on Sunday but City, who play their game in hand at Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday, are now two wins away from history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the type of ruthless performance City inevitably produce down the stretch in title race and they now look likely to wrap up it up at home to West Ham United next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The great players enjoy playing with great pressure," Guardiola said. "These players in the last few years have been able to do it and we are again in the latter stages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Burnley, defeat in London meant a second relegation from the top flight in three seasons. The result also kept Spurs' slim hopes of qualifying for the Champions League alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In other action, a fine second half performance saw West Ham earn a 3-1 win against struggling Luton Town at the London Stadium while Yoane Wissa scored four minutes into added time to secure a 2-1 Premier League win for Brentford at Bournemouth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sean Longstaff's equaliser in first-half stoppage time earned Newcastle United a 1-1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion while Abdoulaye Doucoure scored a first-half winner as Everton beat relegated Sheffield United 1-0 at a balmy Goodison Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doucoure's headed goal was the 101st bottom side United have conceded this season, one more than the previous record set by Swindon Town in 1993-94 in what was then a 42-game campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton, who are in 15th place with 40 points from 37 matches, have now won five home Premier League games in a row without conceding a goal for the first time. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="James Anderson will bow out after a 21-year test career. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752802_1_20240511233930.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's James Anderson will retire from test cricket after the first match of the series against West Indies at Lord's this year, he said on Saturday, ending a 21-year career in which he became the most successful ever pace bowler.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 41-year-old has taken 700 test wickets, behind only Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan (800) and Australia's Shane Warne (708) on the all-time list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having made his debut for England at Lord's in 2003, Anderson will finish his illustrious career at the same ground his 188th test, two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been an incredible 20 years representing my country, playing the game I've loved since I was a kid. I'm going to miss walking out for England so much," Anderson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I know the time is right to step aside and let others realise their dreams just like I got to, because there is no greater feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed the "Burnley Express", Anderson did not say if he would continue playing county cricket for his club Lancashire who renamed the Pavilion End at Old Trafford as the James Anderson End.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm excited for the new challenges that lie ahead, as well as filling my days with even more golf," Anderson added. "Thank you to everyone who has supported me over the years, it's always meant a lot, even if my face often doesn't show it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's first match of a three-test series against the West Indies takes place from July 10-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Thompson, chair of the country's cricket board (ECB), said Anderson deserved a fitting send-off at the home of cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think we'll ever see a bowler to match Jimmy again," Thompson said. (Reuters)

 Kouta Watanabe struck six minutes from time to give Yokohama F Marinos a 2-1 win over Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates in the first leg of the Asian Champions League final on Saturday, earning Harry Kewell's a slender advantage ahead of the return.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mohammed Abbas put Al-Ain in front after 12 minutes when he reacted quickest to a rebound after Soufiane Rahimi's shot was saved by Marinos goalkeeper William Popp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese side pulled level with 18 minutes remaining after Yan Matheus cut in from the right to deliver a curling cross that Asahi Uenaka headed beyond Khalid Eisa to leave the tie delicately poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watanabe grabbed the winner when he slotted in from close range after Ryo Miyaichi redirected Matheus' centre into his path, with the goal given after a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The teams meet again in the UAE on May 25 with the winners taking Asia's last remaining berth at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States next year. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French soccer star Kylian Mbappe said in a video on social media platform X on Friday that he would leave Paris Saint Germain and end his 'adventure' with the club in a few weeks time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is my last year at Paris Saint Germain. I will not stay on and I will end my adventure in a few weeks time. I will play my last match at the Parc des Princes this Sunday," said the 25-year old in his video address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been widespread media speculation that Mbappe will move to Real Madrid. Mbappe did not mention the Spanish champions in his video but confirmed he would leave France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's hard, it's hard. I did not think it would be as hard as it was to announce this, to leave my country, Ligue 1 – a championship which I have always known. But I think I needed this, the need for a new challenge after this year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Borussia Dortmund beat PSG in the Champions League semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar's state-run Qatar Sports Investment firm bought a majority stake in PSG in 2011.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, PSG have won nine Ligue 1 titles, but it has failed to win the Champions League – a key goal for its Qatari owners. (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752580_1_20240510101922.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell tossed in a game-high 29 points and the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers pulled even in the Eastern Conference second round by beating the Boston Celtics 118-94 in Game 2 on Thursday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mitchell had six points at halftime, but scored 16 in the third quarter and seven in the fourth. He was 10 of 19 from the field, including 5 of 7 from 3-point territory. Mitchell tossed in a game-high 33 points when Boston earned a 120-95 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland led by 12 after three quarters, and pushed the lead to 25 after a Caris LeVert three-point play with 4:58 remaining. Boston coach Joe Mazzulla pulled his starters off the court at that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite being in foul trouble for much of the second half, Cleveland's Evan Mobley had 21 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. LeVert [21], Darius Garland [14], Isaac Okoro [12] and Max Strus [12] also scored in double figures for the Cavaliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum had 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists for the Celtics, who shot 8 of 35 from 3-point territory. Jaylen Brown added 19 points for Boston, but was 0 for 6 on 3-pointers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The series will shift to Cleveland for Game 3 on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland center Jarrett Allen missed his fifth straight game with a rib injury. The Celtics were without center Kristaps Porzingis, who has missed the last three games because of a right calf injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics led by nine early, but Cleveland had a nine-point lead, 30-21, after LeVert capped an 11-0 run by making a layup with 58.3 remaining in the first quarter. The Cavaliers had a 30-24 edge after 12 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston owned an eight-point lead late in the second quarter, but Cleveland closed the quarter on an 11-3 run to tie it at 54 at halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavaliers outscored the Celtics 36-24 in the third and had a 90-78 lead when Mitchell made a 3-pointer that just beat the buzzer at the end of the quarter. (Reuters)

 Leverkusen reach Europa League final after Roma draw extends unbeaten run
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bayer Leverkusen staged a stunning late comeback to move into the Europa League final with a 2-2 draw at home against AS Roma on Thursday as they won 4-2 on aggregate and set the longest unbeaten run in all competitions including European matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bundesliga champions Leverkusen, who have also reached this month's German Cup final as they chase a treble, played their 49th match without defeat to surpass Benfica's record set from 1963–65 but they had to battle for the second leg draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xabi Alonso's side, who have 40 wins in their unbeaten run, will face Italian side Atalanta in the May 22 final in Dublin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be a third European final for Leverkusen, who won their only continental title when they lifted the UEFA Cup in 1988 and lost in the 2002 Champions League showpiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roma knew they had a mountain to climb after losing the first leg 2-0 at home but they remained composed in an evenly contested match in which Leverkusen gradually seized control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios struck the post just before halftime, with the rebound deflecting off Roma goalkeeper Mile Svilar's back, but Evan Ndicka cleared the danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Svilar then made another acrobatic save just before the break, denying Amine Adli and then blocking the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Leverkusen's pressure Roma took the lead with a penalty from Leandro Paredes just before halftime after Jonathan Tah fouled Sardar Azmoun. Paredes scored with another spot kick in the 66th minute after Adam Hlozek handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With eight minutes remaining, a Leverkusen corner confused the visiting defence, including the until then excellent Svilar, leading to defender Gianluca Mancini inadvertently deflecting the ball into his own net at the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late substitute Joseph Stanisic then secured Leverkusen's place in the record books deep into stoppage time with the equaliser after a skilful move into the box to delight the ecstatic home fans and leave battling Roma distraught. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafa Nadal looks delighted after getting through his tricky first round match. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752528_1_20240510001836.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal battled into the second round of the Rome Open on Thursday after bouncing back from a set down to beat qualifier Zizou Bergs 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clay court icon Nadal will face world number nine Hubert Hurkacz next as he continued his comeback from injury with a punishing match against his Belgian opponent which lasted nearly three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Nadal's side of the draw are last year's winner, world number four Daniil Medvedev, and the beaten finalist Holger Rune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal has in recent times been a shadow of the player who has won 22 Grand Slams in a storied career which has also brought a record 10 titles in Rome, his most recent in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old has struggled with injury, dropping down to 305 in the world rankings after missing almost all of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned in April from another three-month lay-off with a second-round exit in Barcelona before reaching the last 16 in Madrid last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He showed glimpses of his old self against Bergs who is ranked 108 in the world and is an eight-time title winner on the Challenger tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outsider Bergs, 24, had in previous tournaments taken sets off high-profile players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's losing Rome finalist Holger Rune, and he pushed his illustrious rival all the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big-hitting Belgian briefly looked like he might win the biggest match of his career to date before Nadal fought back to take a hard-fought victory. (AFP)

 Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana exploited Brunson's absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm's length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana's scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lo Wai-fung has made history by becoming the territory's first taekwondo athlete to make the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He's headed to Paris this summer in the under 68kg class because an opponent he lost to in a qualifying tournament in March was disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Taekwondo Association said originally, only the two athletes who made the final of the Asian qualifier would reach the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lo, 22, is now taking the spot because Ali Reza Abbasi from the Refugee Olympic Team was deemed ineligible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the male and female tournaments have four weight categories, with 16 fighters in each weight class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic taekwondo competition begins on August 7.

    Nuggets' Jokic scoops third NBA MVP award

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jokic's 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league this season. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752405_1_20240509100327.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic was named NBA Most valuable Player for the third time in four seasons on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Serbian star, who won the award in 2021 and 2022, finished runner-up in the voting in 2023 but had the satisfaction of leading the Nuggets to a first NBA title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in the regular season and beat out Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks in final voting for the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became the second player, after Oscar Robertson, to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic enters elite territory with a third MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Behind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season – although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last US-born player to win was James Harden in 2018. (AFP)

    Comeback kings Real reach Champions League final

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid showed they remain Europe's comeback kings as Joselu's late double rescued them from the brink of elimination to reach the Champions League final with a dramatic 2-1 second-leg win over Bayern Munich at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 4-3 aggregate victory sealed Real's progress to a remarkable sixth Champions League final in 10 years and they will bid for a record-extending 15th title against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a repeat of their spectacular semi-final comeback win over Manchester City two years ago, they saw their opponents take the lead after Bayern substitute Alphonso Davies fired home a stunning strike from a counter attack in the 68th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Joselu climbed off the bench to equalise following a calamitous error from Manuel Neuer in the 88th minute and, two minutes later, he shinned a second into the Bayern goal from a cross by Antonio Ruediger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The effort was first ruled out for an apparent offside, but the goal was given following a VAR check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn’t matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die," Jude Bellingham, who will play against his former club in the final, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Davies opened the scoring in spectacular fashion, cutting back on his right foot and curling an unstoppable bullet of a shot into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Real, who had dominated proceedings, piled on the pressure with Vinicius Jr tormenting the visitors down the left channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazilian glided past Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Kimmich effortlessly and created a number chances for himself and his team mates, who were denied several times by an inspired Neuer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bayern keeper looked on course to be man of the match as he weathered a storm, but with minutes remaining he fumbled a Vinicius strike from the edge of the box to gift Joselu the equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goal recharged a raucous Santiago Bernabeu under their spectacular new roof and two minutes later Real worked their European magic again, snatching a deserved winner that fired the Spanish giants into another final. (Reuters)

    Olympic flame arrives on French soil for Paris Games

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French rapper Jul lights the Olympic and Paralympic Torch Relays cauldron. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752374_1_20240509023403.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Olympic flame arrived on French soil on Wednesday at the port of Marseille on board a 19th century ship in front of 150,000 spectators for a ceremony that posed a first major test for organisers ahead of the 2024 Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Florent Manaudou carried the torch from the deck of the Belem, a three-masted vessel which had transported it from Greece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manaudou passed the torch to Paralympic champion sprinter Nantenin Keita, who handed it to French rapper Jul to light a cauldron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Belem entered Marseille's Old Port surrounded by hundreds of small boats, planes from the Patrouille de France display team swooped overhead tracing the Olympic rings in the sky before they returned to paint the red, white and blue of the French flag in the air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fireworks also tore into the sky as the Belem docked after its 12-day voyage from Greece, where the flame was lit in Olympia on April 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrival of the flame marks the start of a 12,000-kilometre torch relay across France and its far-flung overseas territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers are hoping the first public spectacle of the Games on French soil – just 79 days from an opening ceremony that will take place on the river Seine – will help build excitement after a row about ticket prices and concerns about security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's something we've been waiting for for a very long time," chief organiser Tony Estanguet said on Monday, referring to the 100 years since Paris last staged the Games. "The Games are coming home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, which was also the host in 1900, sees itself at the heart of the modern Olympic movement after a French aristocrat, Pierre de Coubertin, revived the idea of the Games as practised by the Greeks until the 4th century BC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Covid-hit edition in Tokyo in 2021 and the corruption-tainted Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, the Paris Olympics are seen as an important moment for the sporting extravaganza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the background in Marseille, around 6,000 security forces are on duty at a time when the country is on its highest terror alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other stars to take part in the parade, which continues in Marseille on Thursday, include NBA-winning basketball player Tony Parker and Ivory Coast football great Didier Drogba.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extremely tight security will be a constant feature as the torch travels through more than 450 French towns and cities, and passes by dozens of tourist attractions including the Mont Saint Michel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 200 members of the security forces are set to be positioned permanently around it, including an anti-terror SWAT team and anti-drone operatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has referred to the risk of protests, including from far-left groups or environmental activists such as Extinction Rebellion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers have promised a "spectacular" and "iconic" Olympics, with much of the sport set to take place in temporary venues around the City of Light including at the Eiffel Tower and the Invalides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the absence of a much-feared security scare, the opening ceremony will take place in boats on the river Seine in a radical departure from past Games which have opened in the main stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of the major infrastructure has been completed with only two new permanent sporting venues built in a bid to reduce the financial cost and carbon emissions of the global extravaganza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The idea of the torch rally harks back to the ancient Olympics when a sacred flame burned throughout the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will run from July 26-August 11, followed by the Paralympics from August 28-September 8. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown and Derrick White combined for 57 points as the Boston Celtics scored a dominant 120-95 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers to take a 1-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The No.1 seeds, chasing a record-breaking 18th NBA championship, were always in control against their fourth-seeded Eastern Conference rivals, holding a double-digit lead through the second half to close out an emphatic win at the TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown led the scoring for Boston with 32 points, six rebounds and two assists while the in-form White caught the eye with a 25-point haul that included seven three-pointers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum added 18 points but had an off-night shooting-wise, making just 7-of-19 from the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donovan Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 33 points, with Evan Mobley adding 17 and Darius Garland 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown said the Celtics' defense had laid the foundation for the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It starts with defense, we wanted to set the tone on defense and we kept them under 100 [points]," Brown said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston got off to a flying start, jumping out to an early 12-2 first quarter lead before a Cleveland rally saw them edge into a 23-21 lead after Mitchell's running three-pointer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Boston responded swiftly, reclaiming the lead immediately and never allowing Cleveland to get their noses in front thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After taking a 10-point lead into half-time, Boston kept the pressure up in the second half, stretching out to a 26-point lead in the fourth quarter as they romped to a comfortable win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game two in the series takes place in Boston on Thursday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jonas Vingegaard on Tuesday completed his first outing on a bicycle a month after a horrific crash and insisted he was hopeful of bidding for a third straight Tour de France crown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Of course I hope to be there at the start of the Tour de France," the Danish Visma-Lease a Bike rider said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't know exactly how my shape and recovery will go but I will do everything I can to get there," he added of the June 29 to July 21 race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old was hospitalised after suffering rib and collarbone fractures and sustaining lung damage in a mass crash on the Tour of the Basque Country on April 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the first time back on the bike for me, riding outside and it's really nice to be finally able to ride like normal again and finally to be able to ride on the road is really amazing," Vingegaard said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really looking forward to taking the next steps," he continued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel good, it's improving day by day. I still have some things to recover from but it's going better and better." (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752235_1_20240508075020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Borussia Dortmund showed great composure to reach their third Champions League final after Mats Hummels' second-half goal earned the visitors a 1-0 victory against misfiring Paris St Germain for a deserved 2-0 aggregate win on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes into the second half to send the Germans, who won the title in 1997, into their first final in Europe's top club competition since 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will meet either 14-times champions Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, who clash at the Bernabeu on Wednesday after a 2-2 draw in the first leg, in the June 1 showdown at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG hit the woodwork four times but failed to find the net as Kylian Mbappe, who is widely expected to leave the club at the end of the season, was a shadow of his usual brilliant self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG, who entered the tie as favourites to reach their second final after they finished runners-up in 2020, made an aggressive start and Mbappe had their first chance in the seventh minute with a half-volley as the hosts piled on the pressure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Mbappe on the left flank and Goncalo Ramos as a lone striker, the France forward had some space out wide and the possibility to cut in and threaten the Dortmund goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors, however, were composed and held firm. Their confidence grew and they had their first opportunity through Julian Ryerson, whose shot hit the side netting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG were lucky the score on the night was level at halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luis Enrique's side stepped up a gear after the break with Warren Zaire Emery's shot hitting the outside of the post after Mbappe's attempt was deflected into his path by Ramos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dortmund were more clinical as Hummels headed home from a corner five minutes after the interval to double the German side's advantage over the two legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Mbappe attempt was deflected onto the bar before Vitinha's powerful shot also hit the woodwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG's Ousmane Dembele was a constant threat after the hour mark but, just like the rest of the team, the France forward came more into the game far too late against a side who never lost their composure and fully deserve their place in the final. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year for the fourth time on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gobert tied Hall of Fame big men Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace for the most times winning the award in league history. He received 72 first-place votes and 433 points from a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gobert finished tied for sixth in blocks per game [2.1] and averaged 14 points and 12.9 rebounds in 76 games, his ninth straight season averaging a double-double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Gobert's standout achievement this season was anchoring the Timberwolves' stifling defense. Minnesota ranked first in the regular season in points allowed per game [106.5] and field goal percentage allowed [45 percent] and was top five in blocks [4.5] and rebounds [41.4].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gobert, who is the first player in Timberwolves franchise history to win the award, won his first three Defensive Player of the Year awards with the Utah Jazz, earning the honor in 2018, 2019 and 2021. A three-time All-Star, Gobert has averaged 12,7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 2.1 blocks in 757 regular-season games during his 11-year career with the Jazz [2013-2022] and Timberwolves [2023-2024].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year on Monday, finished second in the voting. Wembanyama, the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft, led the league in blocks per game [3.6] and also averaged 1.2 steals per game. He received 19 first-place votes and 245 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>

 Caitlin Clark’s first WNBA game in Los Angeles is being moved to a bigger stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Los Angeles Sparks said on Tuesday that their home game against Clark and the Indiana Fever on May 24 is being moved from Walter Pyramid on the Long Beach State campus to Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other Sparks home games – May 26 against Dallas and June 5 against Minnesota – are also moving to Crypto.com Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's where the Sparks usually play all their games and it seats 19,067 for basketball games. Walter Pyramid seats 5,000. The games were originally moved to Long Beach because of construction at Crypto.com Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women’s basketball is experiencing unprecedented viewership and attendance numbers so moving these games back to Crypto.com Arena provides us the ability to have more fans in the stands and have our players back to competing on their home floor," Sparks President Christine Monjer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sparks will still open the season on May 15 against Atlanta and play Washington on May 21 in Long Beach. (AP)

    Forest lose appeal against EPL points deduction

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The decision means Nottingham Forest remain on 29 points, three points above the relegation zone, with just two games left to play. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752208_1_20240508001828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest have failed in their appeal against a four-point penalty for breaching Premier League financial rules, the English top flight announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club were hit with the sanction by an independent commission in March for breaching the profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) threshold of £61 million (US$76 million) by £34.5 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest quickly indicated their intention to appeal but an independent appeal board panel has upheld the original penalty, which relates to a three-year assessment period ending with the 2022/23 season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means the 17th-placed club remain on 29 points, three points above the relegation zone, with two games left to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest had sought a reduction in the punishment because they felt the original commission should have taken the big-money sale of Brennan Johnson to Tottenham, two months after the end of the financial year ending 2023, into account as a mitigating factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also felt the original commission had made a mistake by not wholly or partially suspending the sanction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A release published on the Premier League website read: "The club argued that the independent commission committed an error in not treating its sale of a high-profile player shortly after the assessment period as a mitigating factor, and that it committed a further error in electing not to suspend some or all of the points deduction it imposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Each of these grounds was rejected by the appeal board, which found the independent commission was entitled to immediately impose the sanction it did.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The four-point deduction will therefore remain in place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In November, Everton were docked 10 points for breaching PSR, reduced to six on appeal, while a separate two-point deduction imposed on the club for a separate breach is under appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Goodison Park club are now clear of relegation danger following a run of good results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier League clubs are usually allowed maximum losses of £105 million over a three-year assessment period but this is reduced by £22 million per season for any seasons within the period spent in the Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, two time European champions, were promoted to the Premier League in May 2022, meaning two seasons of their three-year assessment period were as a second-tier club. (AFP)

    Brunson brilliance fires Knicks past Pacers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Brunson produced a scintillating fourth quarter performance as the New York Knicks edged past the Indiana Pacers 121-117 in their NBA Eastern Conference playoff series opener on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Knicks talisman Brunson finished with 43 points, six rebounds and six assists to give New York the early advantage in their best-of-seven conference semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was his ice-cool performance down the stretch that swept New York to victory in front of 19,812 fans at an electric Madison Square Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks guard rattled in 21 points in the fourth quarter to complete his fourth straight playoff game with 40 points or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donte DiVincenzo backed Brunson with 25 points while Josh Hart weighed in with a monster performance that included 24 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists, three steals and a block.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner led the Pacers scorers with 23 points while Pascal Siakam added 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's what you love about Jalen," Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said after the win. "I could go on and on about him, but the thing I love about him is he's all about the team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson's fourth quarter rally settled a pulsating contest that saw neither side gain more than a single-digit advantage across four quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers opened up a nine-point lead early in the fourth quarter before the Knicks came roaring back to reel it in, edging into a four-point lead at 113-109 after Brunson's step-back jumper with 2min 42sec remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DiVincenzo also came up with a huge clutch play with 40 seconds remaining, nailing a 28-foot three-pointer to put New York 118-115 ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana got back to within one at 118-117 but a harsh offensive foul called against Turner on DiVincenzo with 13 seconds remaining proved decisive, ceding possession back to New York and allowing the hosts to close out the win. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama was voted NBA Rookie of the Year in a unanimous decision on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French star received all 99 first-place votes from a media panel voting on the award, joining Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard and Karl-Anthony Towns as unanimous winners of the award. Oklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren was a strong runner-up by receiving 98 of a possible 99 second-place votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama lived up to the hype surrounding him as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 draft. He averaged 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocked shots and 1.2 steals in 71 games. His 254 total blocks led the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama led all NBA rookies in points, rebounds and blocks along with double-doubles [43] and triple-doubles [two]. He became the youngest player in league history to post a 5x5 when he had 27 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, five blocks and five steals against the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wembanyama became the first player in NBA history to tally 1,500 points, 700 rebounds, 250 assists, 250 blocked shots and 100 3-pointers in a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the first player from France to win the award and third member of the Spurs, joining franchise legends David Robinson and Tim Duncan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlotte's Brandon Miller [86 total points, including one second-place vote], Miami's Jaime Jaquez Jr. [10 points], Golden State's Brandin Podziemski [four points] and Dallas' Dereck Lively II [one point] also received votes. (Reuters)

    Crystal Palace thrash Man Utd 4-0

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palace have four wins and one draw in their last five under Oliver Glasner. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752087_1_20240507080913.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Michael Olise scored a brace of goals as Crystal Palace completed a league double over Manchester United for the first time in their history with a thumping 4-0 victory at Selhurst Park on Monday that will add to the pressure on Erik ten Hag.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A makeshift United defence that included Casemiro at centre-back was easily picked apart by Palace on several occasions as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell were also on the scoresheet in the impressive win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games, two points behind Newcastle United in sixth, with their hopes of European football next season fading fast. Palace are still in 14th with 43 points from 36 matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United had several injury absentees and were without Bruno Fernandes, the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career he has missed a match with injury, but the ease with which they were beaten will be a huge concern for everyone at the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A big disappointment. We just had an off-day and we weren't in it," midfielder Christian Eriksen said. "It is what it is. We can't really change the injury things. We have to do what we can on the pitch to change it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today it didn't matter who we played. Everyone could have done better. We tried to do what we could but we were not good enough. We'll take the blame as players."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first time in the Premier League era United have lost 13 games in a season and the scoreline might have been worse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home side took the lead inside 12 minutes as Olise collected a throw and evaded a limp challenge from Casemiro. With no United player attempting to close him down, he was able to unleash a low shot from just inside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was 2-0 five minutes before the break as Mateta breezed past United defender Jonny Evans and thrashed the ball into the net for a ninth goal in 11 games since the arrival of Glasner in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The striker had scored 11 goals in his previous 80 games for Palace before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United’s makeshift defence was struggling to contain the movement of their hosts and when Diogo Dalot failed to deal with a ball to the back post, Mitchell had a tap-in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olise’s second goal added more salt to the wound and it could have been worse for the visitors as Odsonne Edouard saw his shot come back off the woodwork late on. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham manager David Moyes will leave "by mutual consent" when his contract expires at the end of the season, the Premier League club said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement of Moyes's impending exit came just a day after the Hammers suffered an embarrassing 5-0 loss to London rivals Chelsea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "West Ham United can confirm David Moyes will leave the club by mutual consent at the end of the 2023/24 season, when his contract expires," said a club statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's announcement came amid media speculation that former Real Madrid, Wolves and Spain manager Julen Loptegui had agreed a deal to replace Moyes, in his second spell as West Ham manager, after the end of the current campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moyes said: "I have enjoyed four-and-a-half brilliant years at West Ham, and the club is in a stronger position than when I returned back in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I joined West Ham for a second time, the club was one place above the relegation zone, and it has been a terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 61-year-old Scot, a former manager of Everton, added: "After leading the club (West Ham) to safety, we guided the team to finishes of sixth and seventh in the Premier League, and I was delighted when we won the Europa Conference League title last June – the club's first major trophy in 43 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four-and-a-half years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham joint chairman David Sullivan told the club's website: "On behalf of everyone at West Ham United, I would like to offer our sincere thanks and gratitude to David for the contribution he has made to the football club during his time as manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "David has been responsible for a period of great progress and success in our history, and we are extremely grateful for all of his hard work, commitment and dedication to the role." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers silenced the young guns of Orlando, beating the Magic 106-94 in game seven of their NBA playoffs first-round series Sunday to book a meeting with Eastern Conference top seeds Boston.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was another magisterial performance from Mitchell, who scored 39 points two days after pouring in 50 in the Cavs' game six defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time he had plenty of scoring support from teammates as the Cavs erased an 18-point second-quarter deficit to clinch a series in which the home team won every game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caris LeVert scored 15 points off the bench and Max Strus scored 11 of his 13 points in the third quarter, when the Cavs out-scored the Magic 33-15 to take charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evan Mobley scored 11 points with 16 rebounds and five blocked shots to help Cleveland withstand a 38-point performance from Paolo Banchero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs, with starting center Jarrett Allen sidelined a third straight game with bruised ribs, moved on to the second round a year after a stinging first-round loss to the New York Knicks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Magic pushed their lead to as many as 18 points in the second quarter before the Cavs clawed back to cut the lead to single digits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banchero's layup in the closing seconds of the first half saw Orlando take a 10-point lead into the break, but momentum was on Cleveland's side and they overwhelmed the Magic in the third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mitchell, relentless in the paint, tied it at 64-64 with a floater and LeVert drained a pair of free throws to give the Cavs their first lead since the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs pushed their advantage to 14 points in the final frame, fans chanting "We want the Celtics" as the final minutes ticked off. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by over seven seconds with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took over the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall, bringing a yellow flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "About time huh?" said Norris, "I knew on Friday that we had the pace...today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy, it all paid off," he added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ireland's Gavin Mullin (left) scores a try during the men's Cup final between Ireland and New Zealand at the HSBC Rugby Sevens Singapore tournament. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751911_1_20240506004950.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand secured double glory at the Singapore Sevens on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's tournaments to signal their Olympic intent with the Paris Games fast approaching.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New Zealand's men held off a determined challenge from Ireland to win 17-14 while their women's team surged to a 31-21 victory over Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand raced into an early 10-0 lead in the men's final with tries by Leroy Carter and Fehi Fineanganofo but Gavin Mullin narrowed the deficit for the Irish just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dylan Collier restored New Zealand's 10-point cushion in the second half but Harry McNulty's response set up a tense finale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks held on for their second series win in a row after their success at Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand forward Tone Ng Shiu said his team were building momentum for the sevens series grand final in Madrid and the Paris Olympics in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We started off slow in the world series this year but now we're just building up to the Olympics, taking it one tournament at a time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two wins in a row -- you've got to be happy with that," added Ng Shiu, who was in the New Zealand side that took the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know there's a bit of pressure to get that gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried two times and we weren't quite there. So hopefully we can embrace the pressure at the next tournament and build for the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina were crowned men's series winners after they recovered from a 10-point deficit to beat South Africa 14-10 in the fifth-place playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Americans won tournaments earlier this season in Cape Town, Perth and Vancouver to top the table with 106 points, two points ahead of the second-placed Irish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain bounced back from a heart-breaking 15-12 extra-time loss to Ireland in the semi-finals to trounce Australia 29-7 in the third-place match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result saw GB leapfrog the United States for eighth place in the league standings and secured their status as a core team in next season's world series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be in that top eight in Madrid secures our programme's funding for another year," said GB captain Robbie Fergusson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means the boys have jobs next year, it means we can have contracts. It means everything," said the Scot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody gave us a hope-in-hell chance this weekend of pushing the USA out of the top eight and taking that spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we had total belief in our group and we did something special this weekend and hopefully we can kickstart a special few months now heading into the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina, Ireland and Great Britain will be joined in the grand final by New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, France and South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, Spain, Samoa and Canada finished outside the top eight and will face four teams from the challenger series in a promotion-relegation event in Madrid to determine next season's core teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's tournament, New Zealand clinched top spot in the standings after a hat-trick of tries by Michaela Blyde helped them to a convincing victory over Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a clash between the top two teams, the Black Ferns trailed 14-5 late in the first half but scored four tries to win their fourth straight tournament after victories in Vancouver, Los Angeles and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France finished third in Singapore and in the standings after a 29-7 victory over Fiji. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans hold a Chinese flag after the men’s finals of the Thomas and Uber Cup badminton tournament in Chengdu. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751910_1_20240506002250.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China completed a Thomas and Uber Cup double on Sunday as both men's and women's teams beat Indonesia to win their respective world team championship finals in Chengdu.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men, who won 3-1, lifted China's first Thomas Cup since they beat Japan in 2018 – and their 11th in all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it meant agony again for 14-time winners Indonesia, who lost their second successive final after falling to India two years ago in Bangkok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's event, Indonesia had earlier been powerless to prevent a flawless China lifting the Uber Cup for a record-extending 16th time with a 3-0 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next most successful women's nation are Japan, who have won the Uber Cup six times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He Bingjiao's 10-21, 21-15, 21-17 victory against Ester Nurumi Tri Wardoyo completed a perfect 24-0 tournament match record for China's women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They regained the title they lost to South Korea two years ago in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the night session, world number two Shi Yuqi got China's men off to a fast start by destroying seventh-ranked Anthony Ginting 21-17, 21-6 in 43 hugely impressive minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pivotal moments came in the first doubles as Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang edged an epic to beat Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto 21-18, 17-21, 21-17 in a 64-minute thriller.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair fought back time and again after trailing 10-4 in the opening game, 6-3 in the second and 8-4 in the third in a gutsy display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number three Jonatan Christie gave Indonesia some hope when he beat sixth-ranked Li Shifeng 21-16, 15-21, 21-17 in 1hr 17min of see-saw action to extend the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Indonesia's chances were snuffed out when He Jiting and Ren Xiangyu ran away with the second doubles 21-11, 21-15 in just 37 minutes to beat Muhammad Shohibul Fikri and Bagas Maulana and seal the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier the outranked Indonesian women's slim chances had hinged on Gregoria Mariska Tunjung breaking through in the opening singles against Chen Yufei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chen never allowed her opponent into the contest in a comprehensive 21-7, 21-16 win in just 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I didn't feel that comfortable although I have played such matches before," said Chen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still feel stressed, and maybe my opponent was. I always feel pressured in finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have lost to her before. What I did was watch a lot of matches that I'd lost to her. It's not going to help if I only watch matches that I won."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan did not give Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti and Ribka Sugiarto a sniff in a 39-minute doubles demolition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scariest thing is when people think you should win," said Chen Qingchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Things become different when you assume you can win. The only thing we need to do is prepare and be humble."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their 21-11, 21-8 canter set up He for the Cup-winning victory in the second singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the last three years we experienced failures, and I'm happy that we could regain the title," said He. (AFP)

    Liverpool crush Spurs, adding to Villa's misery

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool shattered Tottenham's hopes of finishing in the Premier League's top four with a 4-2 win that left Aston Villa on the brink of Champions League qualification despite their 1-0 defeat at Brighton on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Needing a win at Anfield to close the gap on fourth-placed Villa, Tottenham slumped to a fourth successive loss to leave their Champions League hopes in tatters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa are seven points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have a game in hand but will miss out on the top four if Unai Emery's men win one of their remaining two matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Salah was back in the Liverpool team after being dropped for last weekend's draw at West Ham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jurgen Klopp, in the final weeks of his nine-year reign, was celebrating in the 16th minute when Salah notched his 25th goal in all competitions this term with a clinical header from Cody Gakpo's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrew Robertson scored Liverpool's second on the stroke of half-time as the Scotland left-back finished from close-range after Salah's shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was worse to come for woeful Tottenham as Gakpo headed in a 50th-minute cross from Harvey Elliott, who netted the fourth in the 59th minute with a superb curler from 20 yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was little consolation for Tottenham that Richarlison reduced the deficit in the 72nd minute before setting up Son Heung-min's goal five minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Villa win combined with a Tottenham loss would have sealed a Champions League place for Emery's side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Villa were unable to fulfil their part of that equation as Joao Pedro's 87th-minute goal condemned them to a second painful defeat in four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ending Brighton's six-match winless run, Pedro headed in the rebound after Robin Olsen saved his penalty, which had been awarded for Ezri Konsa's foul on Simon Adingra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Stamford Bridge, seventh-placed Chelsea thrashed West Ham 5-0 to keep alive their hopes of European qualification. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Adrian Otaegui shot a superb seven-under-par 65 on Sunday to come from five shots back to win the Volvo China Open and a place in the US PGA Championship in two weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard finished on a 54-hole total of 198, 18-under par, to win the weather-shortened event at Hidden Grace Golf Club in Shenzhen after Saturday's play was cancelled because of dangerous storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave him victory by one stroke from Italy's Guido Migliozzi, who carded a final-round 67.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-round leader Sebastian Soderberg of Sweden, who started five clear of Otaegui, saw the title slip from his grasp with a sorry double-bogey at the 18th when a par would have taken him into a playoff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished at 16-under par after a 72 alongside England's Paul Waring (69) and Switzerland's Joel Girrbach (67).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was starting five shots back so I just didn't look at the leaderboard, not think about the result. Just play my game," said Otaegui who won his fifth DP World (European) Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Otaegui's victory in the final event of the DP World Tour's Asian Swing secured a berth at the season's second major, the US PGA Championship at Valhalla, beginning on May 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, that's very good news," said Otaegui when informed that he had finished third on the Asian Swing standings -- enough to get him into the next major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing some majors this year was a big goal for me," said the world number 143.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will just be enough time to rest a little bit at home next week and then head to America."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saul "Canelo" Alvarez retained his undisputed super-middleweight world title with a convincing unanimous decision over fellow Mexican Jaime Munguia on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez handed Munguia the first defeat in 44 professional bouts, dropping the 27-year-old challenger in the fourth round and inexorably taking control to improve to 61-2-2 in his storied career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges scored it 117-110, 116-111 and 115-112 for Alvarez, who retained his IBF, WBA, WBC and WBO belts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, whose 34 knockouts included victories inside the distance in four of his previous five fights, came out on the attack against the vastly experienced Alvarez, pushing him back with his jab and rattling the champion in the third round with a right to the jaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Alvarez responded in the fourth. After Munguia connected with a pair of solid rights Alvarez followed a left hook with a massive uppercut that sent Munguia to the canvas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth round opened to chants of "Canelo!" ringing in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, where support was evenly divided between the Mexican combatants in a fight coinciding with Mexico's Cinco de Mayo festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Alvarez jab popped Munguia's head back and, in the sixth, an Alvarez left hook had Munguia's knees buckling briefly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a fight billed as a possible changing of the guard, Munguia -- who has honed his aggressive style under the tutelage of longtime Manny Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach -- continued to press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his vaunted power rarely bothered Alvarez, who repeatedly found away past Munguia's guard to land the more damaging blows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know, I take my time," Alvarez said of his measured start.

  <br/>
  "I have a lot of experience. Jaime Munguia is a great fighter. He's strong. He's smart, but I take my time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have 12 rounds to win the fight, and I did. I did really good and I feel proud about it," added Alvarez, who hasn't posted a knockout since he stopped Caleb Plant in the 11th round in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez said that after a few rounds he could see everything that was coming from Munguia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's strong, but he's a little slow," Alvarez said. "I can see every punch." (AFP)

 Real Madrid won Spain's La Liga title on Saturday with four games to spare after beating Cadiz 3-0 while arch rivals Barcelona lost 4-2 at Girona.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It was a three-way thriller to the wire in the 150th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mystik Dan, ridden by Brian Hernandez, held on late to win a three-way photo finish by just a nose over Sierra Leone and Forever Young to capture the first leg of the Triple Crown on Saturday night in front of 156,710 fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's like a dream come true," Hernandez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sent off at odds of 18-1, Mystik Dan made the turn for home in front and stayed on the rail with Forever Young just to his outside and Sierra Leone on the far outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a gasp from the crowd as the three colts hit the finish line. It took several minutes for the racing stewards to look at the finish line photo and declare Mystik Dan the winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose -- which is the closest margin you can have in horse racing -- and it was the first nose decision since Grindstone edged out Cavonnier in the 1996 Derby. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland remained in the hunt to win the world rugby sevens series title after they came from behind to beat series leaders Argentina 21-5 in the quarterfinals in Singapore on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South Americans could have been crowned regular season champions with a win at the National Stadium and they took the lead when Tobias Wade opened the scoring late in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Ireland hit back through Jordan Conroy just before half-time and tries after the interval by Terry Kennedy and Billy Davis secured their victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland have not finished higher than third in this season's series and would need to win the Singapore event while hoping Argentina lose to South Africa in the fifth-place play-off in order to clinch the series title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Conroy was delighted with his side's performance in the must-win game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was a very important game. It was the decider for who could possibly win the whole series, so we were really focused and worked hard and we got the result," said the 30-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we had lost, we would have been out of the title race. But now we've put ourselves in a really good position for tomorrow and we will get our teeth sunk in then."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland's semi-final opponents on Sunday will be Great Britain who trounced France 35-7 in their quarterfinal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British were beaten 19-5 by Ireland in their opening pool game in Singapore but battled back to beat Fiji and the United States to secure their place in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other semi-final will feature Australia and New Zealand who came through a pair of hard-fought quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia squandered a 19-point lead against South Africa but came back to win 29-24 in extra time while New Zealand prevailed 19-14 against the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regular season winners of the sevens series will be decided in Singapore with the top eight teams going through to the grand final in Madrid later this month while the bottom four sides will compete in a promotion-relegation event to determine the core teams for next season's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's tournament, series co-leaders New Zealand and Australia remained on course for a showdown in Sunday's final after they maintained their perfect records in Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand topped their pool with emphatic wins against Ireland, Canada and Spain before seeing off Great Britain 24-5 in the quarter-finals while Australia beat Fiji, Great Britain and Brazil in pool play and sealed their place in the last four with a 24-14 win over Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fiji will face New Zealand in the semi-finals after edging Japan 12-10 while France will take on the Australians following a 24-0 trouncing of Canada. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland scored four times as Manchester City thrashed Wolves 5-1 to move within one point of Arsenal after the Premier League leaders beat Bournemouth 3-0 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  City responded to Arsenal's victory just hours earlier with a goal blitz at the Etihad Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's side took the lead in the 12th minute when Rayan Ait-Nouri clattered into Josko Gvardiol, conceding a penalty that Haaland stroked past Jose Sa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland bagged City's second in the 35th minute as he rose highest at the far post to meet Rodri's cross with a majestic header that looped over Sa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deep into first half stoppage-time, Nelson Semedo tripped Haaland to give City another penalty that was drilled home by the Norway striker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hwang Hee-chan got one back for Wolves in the 53rd minute after a mistake by City keeper Ederson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Haaland curled a fine finish into the far corner in the 54th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Alvarez's 85th minute finish capped City's sixth consecutive league win, extending their unbeaten run in the competition to 20 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reigning champions, who have a game in hand on Arsenal, will clinch an unprecedented fourth successive English title if they win their last three matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They head to Fulham next Saturday before visiting Tottenham on May 14 and hosting West Ham five days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal cruised to a fourth successive victory, with Bukayo Saka's penalty putting them ahead on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard slotted past Bournemouth keeper Mark Travers in the 70th minute before Declan Rice capped a dominant display by blasting home in stoppage-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chasing their first title since 2004, Arsenal's 26th Premier League victory this season equalled the club's top-flight record for a single campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was probably the best first half we've played all season," Gunners boss Mikel Arteta said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were unbelievable. Everything flowing, super composed on the ball. We generated so many chances, we could have gone three, four, five up easily."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal travel to Manchester United in their penultimate game next weekend before hosting Everton on May 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley's hopes of avoiding relegation suffered a huge blow as Newcastle ran riot in a 4-1 win at Turf Moor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vincent Kompany's second bottom side are five points from safety, with only two games left to avoid an immediate return to the Championship after last season's promotion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Callum Wilson put Newcastle ahead with a 19th minute tap-in and Sean Longstaff doubled their advantage in the 35th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Guimaraes made it three in the 40th minute with a powerful strike before Arijanet Muric saved Alexander Isak's 50th minute penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isak made amends five minutes later when he grabbed his 20th league goal this season, making Dara O'Shea's 86th minute header no consolation for bedraggled Burnley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Bramall Lane, fourth bottom Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards survival with a 3-1 win against already-relegated Sheffield United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalo Montiel brought down Ben Brereton Diaz and the Blades forward picked himself up to lash in the 17th minute penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Callum Hudson-Odoi grabbed Forest's equaliser in the 27th minute with a superb strike that curled into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Yates slammed in Forest's second from close-range after 51 minutes and Hudson-Odoi curled home in the 65th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gave the Blades an unwanted record as the first club to concede 100 goals in a 38-match Premier League season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forest, awaiting the result of their appeal against a four-point deduction for financial breaches, are three points ahead of third bottom Luton, who drew 1-1 with Everton on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West London rivals Brentford and Fulham shared a dour 0-0 draw. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ipswich Town's Harrison Clarke celebrates promotion to the Premier League after defeating Huddersfield 2-1. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751824_1_20240504225137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ipswich returned to the Premier League for the first time in more than two decades after beating Huddersfield 2-0 to secure promotion from the Championship on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Wes Burns and Omari Hutchinson ensured the Tractor Boys became just the fourth side in the Premier League era to go from the third to the top tier via consecutive promotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds needed an Ipswich defeat coupled with victory over Southampton to leap into the top two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Daniel Farke's men lost 2-1 to Saints at Elland Road, meaning he will come up against old club Norwich in the playoff semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich's most famous fan Ed Sheeran, who sponsors the club's shirts, was not in attendance for wild scenes of celebration at Portman Road as fans poured on to the pitch and lit blue flares at full-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Suffolk club, which was sold to American investors for just 40 million pounds (HK$391.96 million), will now pocket at least 200 million pounds in television revenue in the coming years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich's rise was masterminded by boss Kieran McKenna, who has earned rave reviews in his first managerial role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenna failed to make the grade as a Tottenham player due to a hip injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 37-year-old thrived as a youth academy coach with Tottenham and then Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was promoted to help coach United's first-team by Jose Mourinho and retained that role under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford before joining Ipswich in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot, mostly seeing how much it means to everyone, the players, the supporters. To be one of the leaders of that is absolutely massive," McKenna said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a wonderful day, I'm very proud of everyone involved. It's what we've done all year. It's an incredible amount of effort." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The commemorative boxing belt for the fight between Saul ''Canelo'' Alvarez and Jaime Munguia in Mexico City. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751812_1_20240504184541.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undisputed super-middleweight world champion Saul "Canelo" Alvarez and unbeaten Jaime Munguia both made weight Friday for their world boxing title showdown in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alvarez, who will put his four super-middleweight belts on the line on Saturday, weighed in at 166.8 pounds (75.6kg) while fellow Mexican Munguia tipped the sales at 167.4 pounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighters greeted each other with respect on the stage in front of the T-Mobile Arena, where thousands of fans turned out to record the spectacle with their cell phones to the sound of mariachi music.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel really good," Alvarez said. "I feel in my prime. I feel in my best, because I've got no injuries anymore, so I feel my best right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll show you guys on Saturday night. I'm in my best shape -- ever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old champion had surgery on his left hand in 2022 after suffering the second loss of his career, against Dmitry Bivol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then,Alvarez has won three straight decisions but he hasn't added to his tally of knockouts and brings a record of 60-2-2 with 39 knockouts to the bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fight marks Alvarez's first since 2017 against a Mexican opponent, who has drawn plenty of fans himself for the bout coinciding with the Cinco de Mayo holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Munguia, who boasts a record of 43-0 with 34 knockouts, vowed to make the most of his opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I'm going to be world champion," said the 27-year-old from Tijuana, who has honed an explosive style under the guidance of trainer Freddie Roach, long-time trainer of Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promoters have hyped the encounter as a potential changing of the boxing guard, with Munguia poised to dethrone an opponent who made his professional debut way back in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unsurprisingly, Alvarez -- and oddsmakers -- see it differently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't care about experiences versus youth, I'm Canelo," Alvarez said this week, predicting a "decisive" victory in defence of his WBC, WBA, IBF and WBO world titles. (AFP)

    Lakers ditch Ham after playoff thumping

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Darvin Ham's prayers were not answered as his team crashed out of the playoffs. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751714_1_20240504034454.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Los Angeles Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham on Friday after two seasons and a 90-74 regular-season record.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We greatly appreciate Darvin's efforts on behalf of the Lakers and recognize the many accomplishments achieved over the past two seasons including last year's remarkable run to the Western Conference finals," general manager Rob Pelinka said in a team-released statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all want to thank Darvin for his dedication and positivity. While this was a difficult decision to make, it is the best course of action following a full review of the season. This organisation will remain unwavering in its commitment to deliver championship-calibre basketball to Lakers fans around the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers finished the regular season with a 47-35 mark, good enough for only an eighth-place finish in the Western Conference. They defeated the New Orleans Pelicans in the play-in round to earn the No 7 seed in the playoffs but were bounced by the Denver Nuggets in the opening round, 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets also defeated the Lakers last season in the conference finals on the way to their first NBA title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All had seemed optimistic in Lakers land when the team roared to the title in the NBA in-season tournament with a 123-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers at Las Vegas on December 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a 3-9 stretch followed, and reports emerged of growing unrest between the players and Ham, 50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers hired Ham on June 3, 2022, to replace Frank Vogel following a 33-49 record in 2021-22, two years removed from winning the NBA championship. It was Ham's first NBA head coaching job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lakers fans chanted "Fire Darvin Ham" in Game 3 of the series with the Nuggets. After the game, All-Star Anthony Davis said the Lakers "don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor" for stretches of games. (Reuters)

 Uefa have agreed to increase squad sizes from 23 to 26 players for the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, European football's governing body said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  International managers had voiced concerns when a return to the pre-Covid-19 23-player limit had been confirmed by Uefa, after it was increased to 26 for Euro 2020 and World Cup 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Uefa Executive Committee has today decided to increase the maximum squad size of the teams participating in the upcoming Uefa Euro 2024 from the original quota of 23 to 26 players," a Uefa statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The increase does not represent an obligation for the participating national associations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participating countries have until June 7 to provide Uefa with a squad list containing a minimum of 23 players and a maximum of 26. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Indiana Pacers powered into the second round of the NBA playoffs on Thursday, thrashing the depleted Milwaukee Bucks 120-98 to win their Eastern Conference series 4-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Unable to close out the Bucks on Tuesday, the Pacers got their uptempo offence flowing again, relentlessly pulling away after trailing by seven points in the opening minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton delivered a double-double of 17 points and 10 assists, but it was reserve guard Obi Toppin leading the Pacers scoring with a career playoff high 21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TJ McConnell added 20 points off the bench along with nine assists and four steals as the Pacers reserves contributed a whopping 50 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud of the perseverance," Haliburton said of Toppin and McConnell. "Obviously neither of them had a really good game last game -- none of us did. We just responded the right way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana led by 12 at halftime, and after the Bucks cut the deficit to seven on a Brook Lopez layup with 1:05 left in the third the Pacers authored an 11-0 scoring run and romped away in the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight-time All-Star Damian Lillard returned from a two-game injury absence and led the Bucks with 28 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lopez and Bobby Portis scored 20 points apiece, but with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo still sidelined by the calf injury suffered late in the regular season the Bucks couldn't find an answer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bucks, who won the title in 2021, lost in the first round for the second straight season after falling to Miami last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers hadn't won a playoff series since 2014, when they reached the Eastern Conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Eastern Conference semi-finals Indiana will take on either the second-seeded New York Knicks or the Philadelphia 76ers, who clashed later Thursday in Philadelphia with the Sixers trying to stave off elimination. (AFP)

    Chelsea shatter Spurs' top four bid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spur's Cristian Romero in action with Chelsea goalscorer Nicolas Jackson. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751602_1_20240503092814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pinpoint headed goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Nicolas Jackson earned Chelsea a 2-0 victory over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Thursday, dealing a blow to Spurs' hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former academy defender Chalobah diverted the ball expertly into the top corner from a Conor Gallagher free kick 35 metres out in the 24th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Chelsea a deserved lead after sustained pressure from the home side with chances for Mykhailo Mudryk, Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke. Spurs defender Micky van de Ven kept his side in the match, with last-ditch tackles in the area and a clearance off the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham's Australian coach Ange Postecoglou looked furious in the dugout throughout the first 45 minutes and his side came out of the second half with greater verve and determination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But efforts by Son Heung-min and Pedro Porro were blocked and saved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senegal's Jackson calmed home nerves against the run of play in the 72nd minute when he was on hand to head home after a free kick from Chelsea top scorer Cole Palmer hit the bar and bounced down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three points, taking them to eighth, were vital for the push by Chelsea, under former Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino, towards a Europa League place after a disappointing season but left Tottenham seven points adrift of the top four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are in a good place," Pochettino said. "We have amazing professionals working on set-pieces. The team really showed in the way we wanted to build this way to play."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described the first half as fantastic. "Then you have to contain and suffer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou took responsibility for the defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like we've lost a bit of belief and conviction in our football and that is on me to change that," he said. "We were nowhere near good enough. That is on me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham have a poor record against their southwest London rivals. They lost the home fixture last November 4-1 and have won only one of their last 10 meetings. (Reuters)

    Sabalenka sets up Swiatek rematch in Madrid Open final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sabalenka had lost three of her last four clashes against Rybakina. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751599_1_20240503092119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Madrid Open champion Aryna Sabalenka produced a brilliant comeback from a set and a break down to beat Elena Rybakina and reach the final on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Belarusian second seed triumphed 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 [7/5] and will face world number one Iga Swiatek on Saturday in a rematch of last year's final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinical Swiatek earlier eased past American Madison Keys with a comfortable 6-1, 6-3 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw third seed Daniil Medvedev retired injured from his quarter-final clash with Jiri Lehecka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka, 25, sealed her victory with a typically powerful serve that Rybakina could not control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big-hitter had lost three of her last four clashes against the 24-year-old but emerged triumphant as they met on clay for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek has a 6-3 record against Sabalenka but in their only match in the Spanish capital, the latter triumphed in three sets a year ago to claim the title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dominant on clay, Swiatek barely put a foot wrong against Keys, making just eight unforced errors in the match to leave the 29-year-old American with virtually no chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Medvedev struggled through to the end of the first set against Lehecka with an apparent upper thigh problem, losing it 6-4 before retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech progressed to his first Masters 1000 semi-final, where he will face Felix Auger Aliassime, who received a walkover after top seed Jannik Sinner withdrew Wednesday with a hip problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taylor Fritz will face Andrey Rublev in the other semi-final on Friday, after the Russian ousted home favourite Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics crushed the Miami Heat 118-84 to complete an emphatic 4-1 series victory Wednesday and book their place in the second round of the NBA playoffs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The postseason top seeds – upset by Miami in last year's Eastern Conference finals – avenged that loss in spectacular fashion with a one-sided wire-to-wire rout at the TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaylen Brown and Derrick White scored 25 points apiece to lead Boston, who barely noticed the absence of the injured Kristaps Porzingis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics threw down the gauntlet in the first quarter, racking up a whopping 41 points to open up a commanding 18-point advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They extended that lead to 22 points by half-time, and kept up the pressure in the third quarter to lead 98-66 heading into the final frame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla could afford to rest his frontline players for the fourth with the game effectively won against an injury-hit Miami team missing Jimmy Butler and Jaime Jaquez Jr.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston will now face either the fourth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers or fifth seeds Orlando in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. Cleveland lead that series 3-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics advance into the next series brimming with confidence after ruthlessly taking care of eighth-seeded Miami in five games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White's 25-point haul included five three-pointers while Jayson Tatum added 16 points including 12 rebounds with three assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam Hauser added 17 points off the bench while Jrue Holiday also cracked double figures with 10 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bam Adebayo led Miami's scoring with 23 points, with Tyler Herro finishing with 15 and Caleb Martin 10. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten cricket pitches have completed their journey up the East Coast of the United States from Florida to New York state and are being installed in a new stadium built for next month's T20 World Cup.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "drop in pitches" have been prepared in Florida since December and were recently transported by 20 trailer trucks to the venue in Long Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surfaces, which will soon be used for games including the highly-anticipated clash between cricket giants India and Pakistan, were developed by Australian Damian Hough, curator of the Adelaide Oval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winter conditions in New York meant that the grass needed to be grown in the warmer climate of Florida before being transported and installed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hough said the journey from the base in Boynton Beach, Florida, to Nassau County in New York state, took over 24 hours, with regular stops for checks and hydration of the grass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The temporary 34,000 capacity stadium at Eisenhower Park has already been built with stands and hospitality areas already in place and the outfield has been put in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hough said the surface is likely to be typical of the kind used for T20 matches, where fans expect to see big shots from the batsmen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our ambition is to produce pitches along the lines where they're good quality pitches, minimal spin, minimal seam and ball coming onto the bat and let the players play the shot," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first World Cup game at the venue will feature Sri Lanka v South Africa on June 3 but organisers are planning some test events before then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the material for the stands has been taken from Formula One motor racing and will be dismantled after the end of the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the international standard playing surface will remain in place with the possibility of it being used for local cricket. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Milwaukee pitchers Abner Uribe and Freddy Peralta and Brewers manager Pat Murphy were suspended along with Tampa Bay outfielder Jose Siri by Major League Baseball Wednesday for their roles in a brawl.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uribe was suspended for six games and Peralta for five, with both players launching an appeal to shorten the punishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Rays said Siri would appeal his three-game suspension while Murphy served the first game of his two-game ban on Wednesday, when the Brewers beat the Rays 7-1 in Milwaukee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were ejected from the Brewers' 8-2 victory over the Rays on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With one out in the sixth inning, an errant fastball from Peralta hit Siri – who had homered earlier – in the left thigh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That led to Peralta, and an incensed Murphy being ejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Siri came to the plate in the eighth he hit a ground ball that was tossed to pitcher Abner Uribe covering first base – where the two traded swings that brought players racing from both dugouts. Siri and Uribe were ejected after order was restored.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could tell that something was being said," plate umpire Chris Guccione said. "We tried to get in there to break them up, but it happened so fast that it blew up." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ronnie O'Sullivan's bid to capture a record eighth world snooker title came crashing down on Wednesday when he was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Stuart Bingham.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bingham, the 2015 champion, came through 13-10 and will face Welsh qualifier Jak Jones for a place in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jones stunned former champion Judd Trump 13-9 in his quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a little cry in my dressing room, I was fearing the worst," said Bingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know how I've held myself together."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bingham, who has lost his place in the world's top 16, pulled away from an increasingly agitated O'Sullivan, reeling off the final three frames to seal a nerve-jangling win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm actually really happy to be honest, it's just the way it goes sometimes," O'Sullivan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like I'm actually getting through the ball, which is more important to me at this stage. It's been a worrying couple of years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not the win I'd have liked to have had, but that's snooker. That's the way it goes. Good luck to Stuart." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Niclas Fuellkrug gave Borussia Dortmund a 1-0 home win over Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League semi-final first leg on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seeking a return to the final for the first time since 2013, the 1997 winners were dogged and determined, outmuscling their heavily favoured opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuellkrug, playing in his first Champions League season at the age of 31, collected a lofted pass from centre-back Nico Schlotterbeck in the 36th minute and blasted a low shot into the left corner of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PSG, led by Kylian Mbappe, hit the post twice in quick succession early in the second-half but could not break through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dortmund, who had already lost and drawn against PSG this season in the group stage, can continue to dream of a return to Wembley 11 years after their last Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the setback, however, PSG will remain confident of overturning the deficit at home next week against a side they thoroughly outclassed at their home venue in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dortmund manager Edin Terzic said pre-match PSG were "built to win the Champions League" since the Qatari takeover a decade ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nowhere was the contrast between the two clubs greater than PSG's global superstar Mbappe, playing in his last season for his hometown club, and journeyman Dortmund striker Fuellkrug, who was playing second-division football this time two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory, along with Tuesday's 2-2 draw between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the other semi-final, guarantees Germany rather than England or France an extra Champions League place for next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That has already secured Dortmund's place in the competition next season (AFP)

    Alcaraz crashes, Sinner hobbles out of Madrid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz exits the Madrid Open at the hands of Andrey Rublev. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751439_1_20240502080854.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz saw his title defence and 14-match winning streak in Madrid come to an end at the hands of Andrey Rublev in the quarter-finals on Wednesday while top-seeded Jannik Sinner withdrew from the tournament citing a right hip injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rublev upset home favourite Alcaraz 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 to reach the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz missed the clay-court tournaments in Monte Carlo and Barcelona last month due to a forearm injury and needed a third-set tiebreak to squeeze past last year's finalist Jan-Lennard Struff in the fourth round on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He couldn't hold off an inspired Rublev though, his quest to become the first man to win three consecutive titles in Madrid coming to a crashing halt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner was due to face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the quarter-finals on Thursday but revealed he has been battling through a hip issue this week in the Spanish capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My hip has been bothering me this week and has slowly been getting more painful. Taking the advice from the doctors we decided it's best to not play further and make it worse," wrote Sinner in a statement on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner is due to play on home ground at the Italian Open in Rome next week before heading for an assault on the French Open, the season's second major, which starts in Paris on May 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elena Rybakina battled back from 2-5 down in the deciding set and saved two match points to overcome Yulia Putintseva 4-6, 7-6 [7/4], 7-5 and reach the semi-finals of the WTA event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A late-match collapse from Putintseva, who smashed her racquet and left it on court after the match, helped Rybakina advance to her sixth semi-final of the season, where she will face defending champion Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Sabalenka picked up a 10th consecutive victory in Madrid with a 6-1, 6-4 win against 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka is 5-3 lifetime against Rybakina but lost three of their last four meetings, most recently in the Brisbane final in January. Their Madrid semi-final will be their first encounter on clay. (AFP)

    Vinicius on the spot to keep Real-Bayern tie level

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vinicius Jr celebrates after slotting home his winning penalty. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751327_1_20240501085033.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr scored twice, including a late penalty, to snatch a 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich in an entertaining Champions League semi-final, first leg on Tuesday, leaving the tie wide open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Brazilian, who put Real in front after 24 minutes, has now scored in the semi-finals for a third successive season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bayern, with only the Champions League title left to fight for, had scored twice in four minutes early in the second half through a Leroy Sane strike and Harry Kane penalty to turn the game around before Vinicius' spot kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always want to win but we know that this competition is like that, you can't give away balls because teams score the chances they have," Vinicius Jr said. "We have to keep our heads calm, rest until next week and we know that we and the fans are going to leave everything at the Santiago Bernabeu to qualify."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now it's time for a magical night at home to win and secure our place in the final," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Facing each other for a record eighth time at this stage of the competition, it was Bayern who got off to a strong start, racking up half a dozen attempts on goal by the 15th minute with Sane and Kane coming close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real needed only one chance to score though, stunning the home crowd against the run of play when Kroos sliced open the Bayern defence with a through ball and Vinicius Jr chased it down to beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kroos almost added another himself in the 51st but his curled shot was palmed wide by Neuer. Instead, it was Bayern who scored two minutes later with a solo effort and shot from Sane that eluded goalkeeper Andriy Lunin for a deserved equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their comeback was complete in the 57th when Jamal Musiala was brought down in the area by Lucas Vazquez and Kane sent Lunin the wrong way from the spot to put the home side ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real, chasing a 15th European Cup, levelled in the 83rd with Vinicius' penalty, after Rodrygo was felled by a clumsy challenge from Kim Min-jae, to set up a mouth-watering return leg in Madrid next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything we're fighting for is in this competition," said Kane. "We've just got to find a way to get it done. Real Madrid away is going to be tough but we've got to go there with full belief and go for the win."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners will face either Borussia Dortmund or Paris St Germain, who meet in the second semi-final on Wednesday. (Reuters)

    Alcaraz holds off Struff to reach Madrid quarter-final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz of Spain is in action during the 2024 ATP Tour Madrid Open tennis tournament at Caja Magica in Madrid, Spain. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751305_1_20240501024942.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Second seed Carlos Alcaraz extended his Madrid Open winning streak to a record-equalling 14 with a hard-fought victory over familiar foe Jan-Lennard Struff to move into the quarter-finals on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of last year's final at the Caja Magica, Alcaraz snapped Struff's six-match winning streak with a 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/4) result to squeeze through to a last-eight clash with seventh seed Andrey Rublev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Jannik Sinner has been dealing with a hip problem but managed to overcome Karen Khachanov 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 to reach his fourth Masters 1000 quarter-final in as many events this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, who missed Monte Carlo and Barcelona with a forearm injury, saved eight out of 10 break points and saw four match points come and go before he completed the two-hour 52-minute win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How much I've missed this! Quarters next," wrote the former world number one on the camera lens after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, who is now 24-0 on Spanish clay since the start of the 2022 season, is bidding to become the first player to win three consecutive Madrid titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After blowing a 2-0 lead in the second set, Alcaraz opened up a 3-1 advantage in the tiebreak, only to lose the next five points and go on to surrender the set to Struff, who came into the tournament on the back of a maiden ATP title run in Munich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A break of serve in the fourth game of the decider gave Alcaraz the score cushion he needed but the two-time Grand Slam champion was broken while serving for the victory from 40-0 up at 5-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Struff saved four match points and the contest fittingly went to a deciding tiebreak. Alcaraz let a 3-0 lead slip, but he got his hands on more match points by landing an inch-perfect lob and he closed on his fifth opportunity of the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This match reminds me of last year's. It was a great fight," said Alcaraz after matching Rafael Nadal's record winning streak in Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was difficult for me to deal with my emotions, to handle difficult moments. Serving for the match, it was really difficult for me to get broken after being 40-0 up, but I'm really happy that at the end it didn't affect me and my mentality and I kept fighting." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Oklahoma City Thunder sealed a 4-0 series sweep of the New Orleans Pelicans to book their place in the NBA playoffs second round on Monday as Boston dominated Miami to move to the brink of the conference semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Western Conference top seeds Oklahoma City finally got the better of New Orleans with a late scoring burst in the fourth quarter to complete a 97-89 road victory in Louisiana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pelicans led by five points with just over eight minutes remaining before Oklahoma City responded with an 18-2 run to close out victory in a hard-fought contest that saw the lead change hands 19 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalen Williams and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 24 points apiece while Chet Holmgren and Josh Giddey each scored 14 and Luguentz Dort 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the Thunder's first playoff series win since 2016 and leaves them facing a Western Conference semi-final against either the Los Angeles Clippers or Dallas Mavericks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Monday, Derrick White scored 38 points as the top-seeded Boston Celtics scored a dominant 102-88 road victory over the Miami Heat to take a commanding 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an enthusiastic 20-point win over Miami in game three on Saturday, Boston picked up where they left off with another emphatic performance over last season's Eastern Conference champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White set the tone for Boston with an electric first quarter display, rattling in 16 points in the opening frame – including four three-pointers – to help the Celtics take a 10-point lead heading into the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston then kept up the pressure with the scoreboard ticking over to open up a 53-36 half-time lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics stretched the lead to 28 points at one stage in the third quarter, and even though Miami rallied in the fourth, narrowing the deficit to 13 points with just over five minutes remaining, Boston's grip on the lead never looked in serious jeopardy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win means the Celtics can clinch their place in the second round, where they will face either Orlando or Cleveland, with a win in game five on Wednesday back in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday's evidence, few would bet against Boston bringing the series to a swift conclusion. (AFP)

    Kelce signs contract extension with NFL's Chiefs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kelce and the Chiefs won their second Super Bowl in a row in February. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751128_1_20240430081139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time Super Bowl champion tight end Travis Kelce, better known to many as singer Taylor Swift's sweetheart, said on Monday he has signed a two-year contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old signed a deal to stay with the Chiefs through 2027 for US$34.25 million and become the NFL's highest-paid tight end, according to multiple reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Back at it again baby," Kelce said in a video posted by the Chiefs on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Feels good to be in KC. I remember coming here 12 years ago, man. It's an honour and a pleasure and I can't wait to get after it these next two years but no better than right now getting fired up for this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just got out on the field with the boys. We're back at it baby. Chiefs forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelce just missed an eighth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season in 2023, catching 93 passes for 984 yards and five touchdowns this past campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I told yall I'll never let him leave!! Congrats my guy! @tkelce," Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 159 career games over 11 NFL seasons, all with the Chiefs, Kelce has caught 907 passes for 11,328 yards and 74 touchdowns
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We signed the greatest tight end ever to a new contract," the Chiefs posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kelce has caught an NFL record 165 passes in the playoffs for 1,903 yards and 19 touchdowns for a Chiefs squad that has reached the AFC Championship six consecutive years and the Super Bowl in four of the past five seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chiefs won their second Super Bowl in a row in February and also won the 2020 Super Bowl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift attended many of Kelce's games, often watching alongside his mother, bringing the NFL and Chiefs in particular extra attention from Swift's devoted fan following. (AFP)

    Premier League clubs agree new spending cap - reports
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Defending champions Manchester City reportedly rejected the proposal. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751109_1_20240430043736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs have reportedly agreed in principle to introduce a spending cap to limit the gap in financial muscle between sides at the top and bottom of the English top flight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clubs will be limited to spending a multiple of the amount of money accrued in television rights by the lowest-earning club in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Athletic reported "the anchoring" plan will be capped at five times the amount the lowest earning side receives via the Premier League's broadcast deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures for last season show the bottom club, Southampton, were paid £104 million (US$130 million) in TV money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said that clubs are expected to be assured that any cap would not cause any of them to reduce spending from their present level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan received at least the 14 votes necessary from the 20 clubs to be approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But defending champions Manchester City, Manchester United and Aston Villa are among those to have reportedly rejected the proposal, with Chelsea said to have abstained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved at an annual general meeting in June, the new model will replace the controversial Profit and Sustainability Regulations (PSR) from the 2025-26 season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton and Nottingham Forest have been docked points this season due to breaches of PSR, which allows clubs to lose only £105 million over a three-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of other clubs are close to crossing that limit, which led to a massive downturn in spending during the January transfer window.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics of a cap on spending believe it could hinder the Premier League's position as the richest and most watched league in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Players' union the Professional Footballers' Association have also opposed "any measure that would place a 'hard' cap on player wages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, those in favour of the plans cite increasing Champions League revenue for the top teams and the spending power of state-backed clubs such as City and Newcastle as justification for limiting spending to maintain a competitive balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier League clubs have already agreed to follow Uefa's new financial fair play regulations from 2025/26 by limiting spending to 85 percent of their total revenue on wages, transfer payments and agents' fees. (AFP)

 Disgraced former Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales denied any financial "irregularities" on Monday after testifying in court in a corruption probe into his time in charge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "What I maintain, and will always maintain, and I am convinced that justice will (demonstrate), is there has never been any money received in an irregular way," Rubiales told reporters after leaving the Madrid court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales, 46, who resigned following global outrage after he forcibly kissed Women's World Cup star Jenni Hermoso on the lips last summer after the final, testified at length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have answered all the questions I was asked, if I have to come here again I will be here, collaborating – I am the one most interested in clearing everything up," said Rubiales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales must appear in court every month and ask permission from the judge before making any trips outside of Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was briefly detained on his return to Spain from the Dominican Republic at the start of April as part of a probe into federation (RFEF) contracts signed since 2018, including one signed by Rubiales to take the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has never been any irregular tender, we have been paid with the utmost excellence and in the pursuit of legality," added Rubiales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On March 20 investigators searched Rubiales' house in the southern city of Granada among 11 locations in the alleged graft scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raids were part of "an investigation linked to presumed crimes linked with corruption in business, fraudulent administration and money laundering," according to judicial sources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Super Cup contracts are worth 40 million euros a year (US$43.3 million) with the deal brokered by Kosmos, a company owned by former Barcelona and Spain defender Gerard Pique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish Super Cup took place for the first time in Saudi Arabia in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It returned to Spain for a year during the Covid-19 pandemic but the subsequent three editions have returned to the oil-rich Gulf state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Spanish football president Pedro Rocha is also under investigation in the alleged graft case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rocha served as federation vice-president under Rubiales, then replaced him on an interim basis before being elected as chief this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales is also set to go on trial over the non-consensual kiss on Hermoso's lips, which under Spanish law can be classed as sexual assault. (AFP)
