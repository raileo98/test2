<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris claimed pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday ahead of Oscar Piastri as McLaren celebrated their first front row lock-out in over a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen took third in qualifying to start Sunday's race on the second row with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz for company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's under pressure teammate Sergio Perez crashed out in the first session, triggering a red flag and increasing pressure on his job as the Dutch driver's number two at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Ricciardo, a former winner at the circuit, produced a late flash of speed once Q1 resumed to top the times in his RB from Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes with the seven-time champion's teammate George Russell the big name absentee from Q2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris led the pack into the top-10 shoot out, with Hamilton, who broke his lengthy winless run at Silverstone last time out, sneaking through with the slowest time of the middle leg of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuki Tsunoda ended up in a wall in his RB, forcing a second red flag with just two minutes left and Norris and Piastri provisionally locking out the front row for McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen had to sit out the conclusion of qualifying when it resumed after Tsunoda's stricken RB was removed due to an issue with his car as McLaren sealed the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton is on the third row after the fifth fastest time ahead of Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari, Aston Martin duo Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll, with Ricciardo and Tsunoda completing the top 10.
  <br/>

    Former world snooker champion Reardon dies aged 91

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ray Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762471_1_20240720202754.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world champion Ray Reardon, the coal miner who dominated snooker in the 1970s, has died at the age of 91.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Welshman Reardon had previously been diagnosed with cancer and passed away on Friday night, his wife Carol confirmed on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ray Reardon, widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever and a six-time world champion, has died at the age of 91," a World Snooker Tour statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jimmy White, one of snooker's most popular players, said on X: "Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978, earning an MBE in the 1985 Queen's Birthday honours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed 'Dracula' after playing a session of the 1974 World Championship final in a cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket, Reardon rose to prominence as snooker became a popular sport in Britain thanks to the Pot Black television programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most," Reardon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He battled the flamboyant Alex Higgins in a long-running rivalry with the "Hurricane" that included an epic 18-15 defeat in the 1982 World Championship final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former world number one worked as a coal miner and was also a police officer for eight years before taking snooker by storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was fortunate to survive a mining accident when a 12-foot girder and a deluge of rubble crashed down on him while he was building a pit lane, leaving him trapped for three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right," he wrote in his autobiography.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon retired in 1991 at the age of 58 but remained in the snooker world, helping Ronnie O'Sullivan as a consultant during his run to the 2004 world title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Welsh Open trophy was named in Reardon's honour in 2016. (AFP)

    Lowry takes Open lead as McIlroy, Woods miss cut

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Irishman Shane Lowry heads into the weekend at Troon two shots ahead. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762385_1_20240720052225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday, as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among the star names to miss the cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Only 10 of the 154 players left in the field are under par as the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast wreaked havoc, with five of the world's top 10 failing to make the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry leads by two from Justin Rose, who came through qualifying to book his place in Troon, and unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown on his major debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here," said Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also well in the running at one under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy's decade-long wait for a major will extend into 2025 at least after a disastrous two days to finish on 11 over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two needed an under par round after shooting 78 on Thursday but carded a triple bogey eight at the fourth in a run of six dropped shots in four holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That four-hole stretch to start off is what cost me," said the Northern Irishman. "Twenty-two holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods was one of the few players to finish below McIlroy on 14 over after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time British Open champion's score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and was his poorest at this event by three shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg, Wyndham Clark and Viktor Hovland were the other top-10 players to miss the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were joined by 2022 champion Cam Smith, Tommy Fleetwood and Sahith Theegala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre bounced back from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to sneak into the weekend at five over. (AFP)

    Japan gymnast Miyata pulled from Olympics for smoking

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Teenage gymnast Shoko Miyata has been pulled from Japan's team for the Paris Olympics after being caught smoking and drinking, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old, a world bronze medallist and captain of Japan's women's gymnastics team for the Games, was sent home from their training camp in Monaco after admitting she had violated their code of conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With her confirmation and after discussions on all sides, it has been decided that she will withdraw from the Olympics," Japan Gymnastics Association (JGA) secretary general Kenji Nishimura told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said the association had been told that Miyata was seen smoking in a private setting in Tokyo some time at the end of June or beginning of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also reportedly drank alcohol in a room at Japan's national training centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoking and drinking are both illegal under the age of 20 in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said it was not clear whether Miyata was at a party or drinking alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being a member of the Japan national gymnastics team is a position where you have high demands on you all the time," said JGA chairman Tadashi Fujita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fujita said that Miyata was already back in Japan after leaving the team's camp and that the JGA would give her support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miyata won bronze in the balance beam at the 2022 world championships in Liverpool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the all-around title at Japan's national championships earlier this year. (AFP)

    Pogacar closes on Tour triumph with stage 19 win

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tadej Pogacar overcame previous issues with altitude to claim stage 19. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762375_1_20240720013404.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tadej Pogacar climbed to a convincing victory on stage 19 of the Tour de France on Friday, extending his overall lead over defending champion Jonas Vingegaard to close on a historic Tour-Giro double.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With two tough stages remaining, the 2020 and 2021 Tour de France champion Pogacar leads Vingegaard by 5min 3sec while Remco Evenepoel remains third, now at 7min 1sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar is also two stages away from a Giro d'Italia and Tour de France double, which would be a first since 1998.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A dominant and confident Pogacar promised to attack here on the 'Queen' stage with its massive mountains and came into stage 19 with a 3min 11sec lead over Vingegaard, with Evenepoel at 5min 11sec in third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous weak moments for the Team UAE rider have come at altitude and in hot weather, as he let slip the last two Tour de France titles to the Dane Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So the 25-year-old will have been happy riding under overcast skies as the mercury dipped to 18.5 Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was plenty of altitude on the menu however as the pack first crossed the fan-packed Col de la Bonette, a 23km climb at 7 percent average gradient to the dizzying altitude of 2,800m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final climb to Isola 2000 ski resort is hardly less crushing and Pogacar attacked with a jaw-dropping 10km to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left his rivals trailing in his wake and chewed up the attackers one by one in quick succession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matteo Jorgenson was second on the day at 21sec, while Simon Yates had led much of the way but dropped to third at 40sec after Pogacar passed him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Carapaz was fourth at 1min 11sec and Evenepoel fifth with Vingegaard on his wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eritrean break-out star Biniam Girmay retained the green sprint jersey ahead of Jasper Philipsen as the escape group took the intermediate sprint points way ahead of the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay and Philipsen have both won three stages on this year's race, while Pogacar has four. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal continued his Olympic preparations with a confident 6-4, 6-4 win over Cameron Norrie at the Bastad Open on Thursday, showing signs of the power hitting that fired him to 14 French Open titles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old Spaniard continued his return to winning ways on the Swedish clay as he moved into the quarter-finals, racking up his ninth Tour win of the year and back-to-back wins for the first time since reaching the last-16 of the Madrid Open in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Great feelings now, I've been a while now without playing on the Tour since Roland Garros and had the chance to compete well against a great player like Cameron," said Nadal during his on-court interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I played, for moments, good tennis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal now leads the former world number eight Briton 5-1 in their head-to-head record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam champion was unstoppable as he ground his opponent down with powerful, topspin-heavy ground strokes. He broke Norrie again and served out to love, having won five games in a row to take the match in straight sets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian Victor Campenaerts wept with joy after winning stage 18 of the Tour de France as overall leader Tadej Pogacar and defending champion Jonas Vingegaard saved their thunder for a trilogy of harsh stages over the final weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pogacar and Vingegaard were relaxed as the escape pulled 15 minutes clear, the pair content to hold fire as the 2024 Tour reaches its climax in Nice on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow and Saturday," Pogacar said at the line, shaking his head as if the names of the day's themselves explained the massive challenge ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we enjoyed today with the team, what a wonderful journey," said the 2020 and 2021 champion who came second on the last two Tours to Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Slovenian is three days away from a cycling landmark as he won the Giro d'Italia in May and will become the first rider in 25-years to complete the double if he holds on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar retained a 3min 11sec lead on Vingegaard as the peloton rolled gently over the finish line 13min 41sec after the winner, while rookie Remco Evenepoel is third at 5min 09sec. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Marseille have signed striker Mason Greenwood from Manchester United, the Ligue 1 side announced on Thursday, despite the objection of some of the French club's fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old, who has played once for England, was suspended in January 2022 by Manchester United following allegations of attempted rape and sexual assault but prosecutors dropped charges in February 2023. He spent last season on loan at Getafe in La Liga.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Olympique de Marseille are delighted to announce the signing of Mason Greenwood from Manchester United. The 22-year-old striker has signed for the club following a successful medical," said the French club on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marseille made no mention of the allegations in their statement. They called Greenwood "a precocious talent" and an "English nugget".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The southern club, eighth in Ligue 1 last season, said their new striker will wear the number 10 shirt but did not specify the length of his contract or mention any fee to Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the deal is reported to be worth an estimated 30 million euros (US$32.7 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We wish Mason all the best in his future career," said United on their website. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Vieira stood down as manager of Strasbourg, the Ligue 1 club confirmed on Thursday, as his name was linked to the vacant United States men's team coaching job.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vieira, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, joined Strasbourg last season and is leaving "by mutual agreement," the French club said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, 48, coached New York City in the MLS between 2016-2018 and, according to widespread reports, could be returning to the US to succeed Gregg Berhalter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berhalter was axed as United States coach following their first-round exit in the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira was asked about the States job last week after Strasbourg lost 4-0 to Turkish giants Fernebahce in a pre-season friendly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States? Ah no, my focus is 100% in Alsace (Strasbourg)" he told a local newspaper in the north eastern region of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, who was under contract with Strasbourg until 2026, ended last season with his club in 13th place in Ligue 1. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Justin Thomas made a strong start at the 152nd Open but then hit trouble as rain squalls kept a grip on the early scoring at Royal Troon in Scotland on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Alex Noren was the early clubhouse leader with a birdie on the 18th giving him a two-under-par 69, but Thomas initially looked like eclipsing that mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former PGA Championship winner gathered four birdies with one bogey on his outward nine and then birdied the 10th to top the early leader board on four under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a double-bogey six at the 12th and a bogey on the 13th dropped him back into the pack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow American Bryson DeChambeau, last month's US Open champion, started in the company of young Swede Ludvig Aberg, who is ranked fourth in the world, but the big-hitting DeChambeau suffered a terrible start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was five over after his first six holes and in danger of playing himself out of contention on day one. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Argentina's Fernandez (right) during the 2024 Copa America final against Colombia. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762065_1_20240718084300.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into racist chants by Argentina players after they won the Copa America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "FIFA is aware of a video circulating on social media and the incident is being looked into," a spokesperson for world football's governing body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added: "FIFA strongly condemns any form of discrimination by anyone including players, fans and officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chants were heard during a live video posted on social media by Chelsea and Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez from the team bus in the wake of the Copa victory over Colombia in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some players, including 23-year-old Fernandez, sing a chant dating back to the 2022 World Cup final in which Argentina beat France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The song targets France's star striker Kylian Mbappe among others and includes racist and homophobic insults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea had earlier announced they had launched an internal disciplinary procedure against Fernandez over the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez has apologised and the club said in a statement it had launched an "internal disciplinary procedure".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chelsea Football Club finds all forms of discriminatory behaviour completely unacceptable," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We acknowledge and appreciate our player's public apology and will use this as an opportunity to educate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez, who joined Chelsea from Portugese club Benfica in 2023, said in his apology: "The song includes highly offensive language and there is absolutely no excuse for these words.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I stand against discrimination in all forms and apologise for getting caught up in the euphoria of our Copa America celebrations." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal and Casper Ruud saved a match point in the deciding set tie-break to reach the semi-finals of the doubles in Bastad on Wednesday, hours after the Norwegian was knocked out of the singles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadal and Ruud squeezed past France's Theo Arribage and Roman Safiullin of Russia 6-4, 3-6, 12-10 to advance to the last four, winning the final three points of the match after being on the brink of defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we had some fun. It was an emotional match at the end, a good level of tennis against two good players," said Nadal, who is also competing in the singles tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We enjoy it, the crowd was amazing. Full crowd in a doubles match, that's fantastic. Just enjoying every single day here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Nadal and Ruud wait to discover their semi-final opponents, the Spaniard will be back in action on Thursday against Britain's Cameron Norrie in the round of 16 in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam champion returned to competition for the first time this week since his early French Open exit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will hope to avoid the same fate as Ruud, whose Olympic preparations took a hit when he lost 6-3, 6-3 to Thiago Monteiro in the second round earlier on Wednesday. (AFP)

 Ecuador's Richard Carapaz won stage 17 of the Tour de France after the remnants of a breakaway finished ahead of the main pretenders in the High Alps on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  EF rider Carapaz dropped Simon Yates and soloed the final 10km to win his first ever Tour de France stage after finishing third overall in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Giro d'Italia champion, who won the Tokyo Olympics road race, also wore the overall leader's yellow jersey after his efforts in the second stage to Bologna.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall leader Tadej Pogacar, defending champion Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel kept their powder dry until late in the medium mountain run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio then produced an entertaining scrap with third-placed Evenepoel finishing 12sec ahead of Pogacar, with Vingegaard losing two seconds to the leader. (AFP)

    R&amp;A chief 'doesn't care' about Open prize money gap

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rory McIlroy bumps fists with a fan after a practice round ahead of the 152nd British Open Golf Championship at Royal Troon. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762031_1_20240718004735.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers has said he "doesn't care" that the British Open's prize fund is not among the top 25 in men's golf.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Royal & Ancient Golf Club announced minimal increases to prize money for the 152nd British Open this week amid "concern" about the impact on financial sustainability and the perception of men's golf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner at Royal Troon on Sunday will receive £2.38 million (US$3.1 million), which is an increase of just US$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bryson DeChambeau earned US$4.3 million for winning last month's US Open, while Scottie Scheffler's Masters victory in April came with a US$3.6 million prize.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total British Open prize fund of US$17 million is up by just US$500,000 on last year and stands as less than the other three majors, 12 PGA Tour events and all 14 Liv Golf events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A, I didn't know, and B, I don't care," said Slumbers, who is set to step down from his role in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we will always offer a very competitive prize fund for the Open, our wider focus is on increasing participation and improving pathways in golf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to make choices about how we allocate resources and make the resources we have go as far as they can. Our responsibility is to ensure the game is thriving 50 years from now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not worried about being a lone voice. Sometimes leadership is lonely."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 158 players, rather than the usual 156, will contest this year's British Open after more past champions than expected opted to play at Royal Troon, with 18 players from Liv Golf in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But while USGA chief executive Mike Whan said last month he is serious about creating a formal pathway for Liv players into the US Open, Slumbers suggested that was not necessary for the British Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We decided after last year's event that we wanted to ensure that there was sufficient enough opportunities for all players, whichever tour they're playing on, to get into the Open," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used our Open Qualifying Series. We picked events that were available for all players. We used the Asian Tour and we used final qualifying to create those opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will that evolve in the coming years? I think that depends on how the game evolves. But we will continue to want the best players in the world to be able to get into the Open in an appropriate way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for future venues, Slumbers said that the Open was "absolutely" going to return to Muirfield for the first time since 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The possibility of staging the Open outside the UK for the first time also remains on the agenda, with Portmarnock having asked the Irish government for support in putting forward a case to stage the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are fully supportive of the club doing that and we are actively engaged in making those assessments," Slumbers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But no decisions have been made because we don't even know if it's possible." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boston's Jarren Duran, the All-Star MVP, hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the fifth inning as the American League beat the National League 5-3 on Tuesday night for its 10th win in the past 11 All-Star Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes pitched a hitless first for the NL, twice hitting 100mph, and Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run homer in the third for a 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Juan Soto hit a two-run double and scored on David Fry's single to tie the score in the third, and Duran went deep off Cincinnati's Hunter Greene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duran is the fifth Boston player to be an All-Star MVP, the first since J.D. Drew in 2008. The others were Pedro Martinez in 1999, Roger Clemens in 1986 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nadal celebrates after his victory against Sweden's Leo Borg. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761891_1_20240717084121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal swept past Leo Borg, son of tennis great Bjorn Borg, to advance to the second round of the Bastad Open on Tuesday as he builds towards the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was Nadal's first singles match since the 38-year-old fell in the opening round at Roland Garros on May 27, and he eased to a 6-3, 6-4 win in wet conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Nadal and the 21-year-old Borg, currently ranked 461st in the world, were wild card entries to the Swedish clay-court tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an early scare with the former world number one slipping on the wet white line, Nadal broke for 3-1, hitting four aces to take the first set in 43 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An immediate break gave the Spaniard a foothold in the second, sealing the match on his second match point after 1hr 25min on court for his eighth ATP tour match win this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's good, I'm finally defending my title," joked Nadal, who has not played in Bastad since winning the title aged 19 in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't been playing a lot of tennis in the last few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even in the tougher moments, I have been able to keep going with the help of the team, but of course the fans have a huge impact on that. They give me amazing energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam winner praised his rival, the son of the long-retired former world number one Bjorn Borg, now 68.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a huge honour to play against the son of one of the biggest legends in the history of our sport," said Nadal. "I think he played quite well, he has a great future in front. I wish him all the very best." (AFP)

    Real Madrid officially unveil Kylian Mbappé

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé finally put on a Real Madrid jersey on Tuesday, fulfilling his childhood dream in front of a packed Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 80,000 fans were in hand at the Bernabeu to welcome the 25-year-old France star during his official presentation as the club's newest player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After signing his five-year contract with the Spanish powerhouse alongside club president Florentino Pérez, Mbappé entered the stage set up at the Bernabeu to loud cheers by the Madrid fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wearing the No. 9 jersey, Mbappé smiled broadly and waved to the fans who chanted his name, then embraced Pérez and former Madrid player and coach Zinedine Zidane, who invited Mbappé to visit the Spanish club for the first time when he was just a teenager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's an incredible day for me," Mbappé told the crowd, in good Spanish. ”Since being a kid I dreamed about playing for Madrid and today I'm here. It means a lot to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé finished his speech by asking the crowd to join him and chant “Hala Madrid,” similar to what his childhood idol – and “now friend” – Cristiano Ronaldo did when he arrived at the club. Mbappé then kissed the club’s shield and went around the Bernabeu kicking balls to the crowd in the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now I have another dream, which is to live up to the history of this club, the best club in the world,” he said. “I’ll give my life to this club and to this shield.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record 15 European Cups won by Madrid were on display on the stage where Mbappé was introduced. His relatives, club officials and several former players were also by the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I see my family happy, I see my mother crying,” said Mbappé, who earlier Tuesday underwent his physical with Madrid's doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The message “Welcome, Mbappé” was shown on the large video boards at the newly revamped Bernabeu, which had its roof closed for the midday ceremony in the Spanish capital. (AP)

    Gareth Southgate resigns as England manager

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After eight years, four major tournaments and two finals, Gareth Southgate announced he was stepping down as England manager on Tuesday, saying it was “time for change.”
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunday’s 2-1 loss to Spain in the European Championship final proved to be his last game in charge of the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As a proud Englishman, it has been the honor of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all,” he said. “But it’s time for change, and for a new chapter.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate’s contract was due to expire this year and his announcement comes after months of uncertainty surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Oyarzabal’s 86th-minute winner in Berlin was a painful way to end his reign after he transformed the fortunes of England’s underperforming national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hired in 2016, he led England to back-to-back finals at the Euros and to the semifinals of the World Cup in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, ultimately, he was unable to end the nation’s decades-long wait for a first major trophy since the World Cup in 1966. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's Thomas Müller has called time on his 14-year international career after their European Championship exit, the Bayern Munich forward said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old featured in his eighth and last tournament on July 5, in Germany's 2-1 quarter-final defeat by Spain, where he was brought on as a substitute in the 80th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Müller helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup and has the third most appearances for the national team with 131 caps and 45 goals. He also won the Golden Boot and Young Player Award during the 2010 World Cup, when Germany finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It always made me very proud to play for my country. We celebrated together and sometimes shed a tear together," Müller said in a farewell video on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I had the privilege of making my first international appearance, I would never have dreamed of all this. I would like to say thank you to all the fans and my Germany teammates for their support over the years. Take the enthusiasm and joy of this year's Euros with you." (Reuters)

    Copa chaos raises concerns for 2026 World Cup

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans rush the gates before the Copa America final at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, Florida. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761747_1_20240716082151.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chaotic scenes at the Copa America final have raised serious questions for the organisers of the 2026 World Cup which will be held in North America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The start of Sunday's final between Colombia and Argentina at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium was delayed by 82 minutes as overwhelmed security struggled to process the safe entry fans into the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers blamed ticketless fans for rushing the entry points into the venue for their decision to keep the gates closed for almost three hours after the planned opening time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, while there was plenty of evidence of ticketless fans entering, it was also clear that the security system was unable to cope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some fans needed medical attention for heat exhaustion after being stuck in the crush around the fencing at the entrance to the 65,000 capacity venue amid alarming scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hard Rock Stadium will host seven games at the 2026 World Cup which the USA is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Copa America was organised by South American confederation CONMEBOL while the World Cup will be controlled by global governing body FIFA and it's local organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not a good look," said former USA international Alexi Lalas, now a leading television pundit for Fox Sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand this is not a good look for CONMEBOL and this is also, because it is happening on our watch, in our country, not a good look for the US less than two years out from the World Cup," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA, who had no role in the running of the Copa, did not immediately comment on the incidents but sources indicated they would now intensify discussions with stadiums over their security plans. (AFP)

 Thousands of people in Madrid welcomed Spain's squad home on Monday after they beat England to win Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After receptions with King Felipe VI and prime minister Pedro Sanchez, La Roja were paraded through the capital city on an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was adorned with the message "it's only the beginning" and the trophy sat at the front of the bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want a lot," Sanchez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want more," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The likes of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Sunday's match-winner in Berlin, Mikel Oyarzabal, wore white t-shirts with the number four on them in reference to the record number of times Spain have won the European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For now, we're not realising yet what we have accomplished," Williams said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacker, who scored the opening goal of the 2-1 victory, was also eager to thank Spain's fans "for the love and warmth they brought the team".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team bus took them to Plaza Cibeles in central Madrid where thousands more fans waited to celebrate the success, following on from victories in 1964, 2008 and 2012. (AFP)

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun is looking to take part in his second Olympics next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clinched gold in men's single sculls in the lightweight category of the World Rowing Cup in May, which involved athletes weighing no more than 72.5 kilogrammes. Now, he's taking on a whole new challenge by participating in the open category in the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu told RTHK he's adopting a new strategy that he believes will better prepare him against the "real giants".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina captain Lionel Messi hopes forward Angel Di Maria ends his international career with a goal in Sunday's Copa America final against Colombia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Di Maria, 36, announced in November his plans to retire from internationals after representing his country for 15 years and Messi wants him to get his name on the scoresheet as he did against Brazil to clinch the continental title in 2021 and against France as they won the 2022 World Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe he'll score another goal in the final like he did in all the previous ones he's played in. It would be extraordinary," Messi said in an interview with Direct TV Sports, adding that the team still hopes he will reverse his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always tell him that if everything goes well, we have playoff games coming up. Nevertheless, 'Fideo' (Di Maria) has made up his mind and there's nothing that can change it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Di Maria has scored 31 goals in 144 appearances for Argentina, having played in six Copa Americas and four World Cups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also struck the winner in Argentina's 1-0 victory over Nigeria to win Olympic gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz overpowered seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets to retain his Wimbledon title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish third seed produced a performance combining awesome power with delicate touch to win 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/4), collecting the fourth Grand Slam of his young career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz equals the Open Era record for most Grand Slams won at the age 21 or under, joining Boris Becker, Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he is just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, who had knee surgery just weeks ago, was aiming to win a 25th Grand Slam - which would have been a record in the men's and women's game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he had no answers in the Centre Court sunshine as the electric Alcaraz pounded him from the back of the court and treated the crowd to an array of his trademark drop shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly, it is a dream for me winning this trophy," said the Spaniard. "I did an interview when I was 11 and I said my dream is to win Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me this is the most beautiful tournament, the most beautiful court and the most beautiful trophy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz paid tribute to his beaten opponent, who only found his range in the third set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Djokovic is an unbelievable fighter, I knew he was going to have his chances," said Alcaraz who had needed five sets to defeat the Serb in the 2023 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was difficult but I tried to stay calm going into the tie-break and tried to play my best tennis. I was glad at the end I could find the solutions."(AFP)

    Last-gasp drop goal lifts Ireland over Springboks

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland toppled rugby world champions South Africa 25-24 with a drop goal by Ciaran Frawley in the last second of a ferocious body-smashing contest at Kings Park on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Irish rebounded from losing 27-20 last weekend in Pretoria by notching only their second ever win over the Springboks in South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It didn't look like it would happen after the Springboks came back from 16-6 down at halftime, finding another gear and forcing errors that Handre Pollard used to kick eight penalties from eight attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after falling behind 24-19 with 15 minutes to go, Ireland found the energy to pin South Africa in their 22. They waived off a penalty kick to go for a try and squandered a tapped penalty. But, out of nowhere, replacement flyhalf Frawley lined up a 42-metre drop goal in the 70th minute to keep them in touch at 25-22 behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irish, playing their 15th and last test of a super-long Rugby World Cup season, rallied yet again and, as the match clock ticked into the red, Frawley let fly with another drop goal from the same length as the first and won a gripping match and squared a classic series. (AP)

    Resurgent Australia pile more misery on Wales

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wales' Rio Dyer dives in to score a try in the corner and set up a tense finale. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761485_1_20240714011612.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A resurgent Wallabies earned their first back-to-back rugby Test wins since 2021 on Saturday with a hard-fought 36-28 victory over Wales, who extended their horror run to nine straight defeats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Filipo Daugunu scored twice with Jake Gordon and Allan Alaalatoa also crossing on a wet and cold Melbourne night to back up their 25-16 triumph in Sydney a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took a 23-14 lead into the break and withstood intense second-half pressure and a series of handling errors to seal the series 2-0 and give new coach Joe Schmidt the second win of his tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was tough, bit of relief at the end there," said Wallabies skipper James Slipper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was scrappy from us for sure, it wasn't our best game, but we got the result. There's plenty to work on though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are gritty, they hang in there, they played our kicking game really well tonight," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat piled more pain on Warren Gatland's team which is now one loss away from equalling Wales' all-time record of 10 consecutive defeats, which came in 2002 and 2003 under another New Zealander, Steve Hansen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have slumped to 11th in the world rankings, below Fiji and Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite clawing back from 17-0 down after 25 minutes, they paid the price for conceding too many penalties and again lost the breakdown battle, sorely missing injured workhorse No 8 Aaron Wainwright.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We never gave up, we had a never-say-die attitude," said Wales captain Dewi Lake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But obviously we are a young team and we don't have enough experience really at Test level. What matters is results and we are not giving ourselves those at the moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taine Plumtree assumed Wainwright's role in the back row with James Botham, grandson of England cricket great Ian Botham, starting at blindside flanker and Tommy Reffell at openside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they were immediately exposed as Australia scored inside seven minutes with a move that started from near their own try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under pressure, wing Andrew Kellaway sidestepped the Welsh defence then collected his own chip before offloading to a charging Fraser McReight who powered up the field and found Daugunu to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the rain hammering down, they kept the pressure on with Lolesio making it 10-0 off the tee with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu made a try-saving tackle on Botham as Wales warmed to the task, but it was Australia who scored once more against the run of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scrum-half Gordon sent up a box kick and a handling error from fullback Cam Winnett allowed him to collect it and weave past two defenders to the try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undeterred, a well-worked rolling maul from the lineout saw Lake muscle over to get Wales on the board after half-an-hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Australia's Lukhan Salakaia-Loto in the sin-bin he repeated the feat soon afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both tries were converted to get Wales back in the game at 20-14 and an early converted try to veteran winger Liam Williams in the second-half put the Wallabies on notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the hosts proved they too could work a rolling maul, with Alaalatoa powering over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu got his second after a schoolboy error from Williams, who tried to keep the ball in play from a Wallabies kick, only to palm it perfectly to a charging Daugunu who surged to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Australia a 33-21 lead, but they went to sleep and Wales winger Rio Dyer smashed over in the corner to set up a tense finale. (AFP)

 Tadej Pogacar extended his overall lead on the Tour de France when he won stage 14 in the Pyrenees on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His arch rival Jonas Vingegaard came second at 39sec while Remco Evenepoel was third at 1min 10sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of another monster run in the Pyrenees on Sunday, Pogacar extended his lead to 1min 57sec over Vingegaard as Evenepoel dropped to third at 2min 22sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar's team UAE waited until the third and final climb of the day before sending Adam Yates on an attack that the Slovenian would soon join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Pogacar unleashed a ferocious acceleration, his two podium rivals followed, but were either unwilling or unable to match the pace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the final section of a climb, packed on either side by raucous fans, 2020 and 2021 champion Pogacar extended his lead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Barbora Krejcikova won Wimbledon for her second Grand Slam title with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 victory over Jasmine Paolini in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is a 28-year-old from the Czech Republic who adds this trophy to her championship at the French Open in 2021 .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was unseeded in Paris back then and was only the 31st of 32 seeds at the All England Club after illness and a back injury this season limited her to a 7-9 record entering this tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is the eighth woman to leave Wimbledon as the champion in the past eight editions of the event. Last year's champion is also from the Czech Republic: unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, who lost in the first round last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seventh-seeded Paolini was the runner-up at the French Open last month and is the first woman since Serena Williams in 2016 to get to the finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same season. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New Zealand hung on to beat England after two tries from Mark Tele'a. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761467_1_20240713204131.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wing Mark Tele'a scored two tries on Saturday as New Zealand squeezed past England 24-17 to win a hard-fought second rugby Test in Auckland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tele'a touched down either side of half-time as the All Blacks took the series 2-0 and extended their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just like in the 16-15 first Test win at Dunedin, New Zealand had to wrestle back the lead in the second half from a spirited England side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hugely proud of the boys to hold on and win the arm wrestle and finish off a good performance," said New Zealand captain Scott Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Test matches certainly challenge your character and we had to dig deep there, right till the last minute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Marcus Smith led the visitors to a 14-13 advantage at half-time after his pin-point cross-field kicks created tries for wing Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a breathless opening spell, the All Blacks took the lead when Tele'a caught the England defence napping from a ruck to dart over for a try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All Blacks fly-half Damian McKenzie landed the conversion, but England immediately hit back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith kicked wide into the arms of Feyi-Waboso, who stepped inside the defence for a converted try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand should have had a second try when Tele'a broke away, but Smith intercepted the final pass to Stephen Perofeta on the England tryline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed a penalty, but Smith quickly took the kick-off to pin the All Blacks deep in their own half, where they stayed for the next 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie stroked over another penalty, but England led at half-time after Freeman outleapt Tele'a to haul in Smith's kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England number 10 successfully converted from the touchline .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England started the second-half camped in the All Blacks half and Smith extended the lead to 17-13 with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half an hour left, scrum-half Cortez Ratima came on to make his All Blacks debut when he replaced the dazed Finlay Christie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game's momentum swung New Zealand's way when the All Blacks brought on Beauden Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The twice world player of the year showed his class by restoring the lead for New Zealand when he scythed through a gap to put Tele'a over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie missed the conversion, but landed two penalties to pull New Zealand out of England's reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors fought until the end with England captain Jamie George denied near the New Zealand line from scoring a potential match-levelling try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're a significantly better team than we when we started," said England captain George.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's hugely exciting times ahead for this English team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll welcome them to Twickenham in November, we'll look forward to that." (AFP)

    Djokovic, Alcaraz to clash again in Wimbledon final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At 37, Novak Djokovic can become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he beats Carlos Alcaraz this time around.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic swept past Lorenzo Musetti on Friday to book a second successive Wimbledon final against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and move one win away from a record-setting 25th Grand Slam title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just five weeks after undergoing knee surgery, seven-time Wimbledon champion Djokovic reached his 10th final at the All England Club with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 win over the Italian 25th seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz earlier defeated Daniil Medvedev 6-7 (1/7), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach a fourth Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, can equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles and become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he avenges last year's dramatic five-set final loss to Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time Djokovic and Musetti met was at the French Open in June when the Serb claimed victory in a third round tie which ended at 3:07 in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, however, Djokovic was untroubled on his way to a 37th Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He broke for 4-2 lead in the opener and, despite surrendering the advantage and letting two set points slip in the ninth game, he broke again in the 10th to claim the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second seed was playing in his 49th Grand Slam semi-final while the 22-year-old Musetti was in his first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That experience was key as Djokovic hit back from losing serve in the opening game of the second set to level in the sixth before dominating the tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A break in the opening game of the third set launched him on his way to victory against a demoralised Musetti, who at least had the consolation of saving three match points before Djokovic completed his progress to yet another Wimbledon final. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"Playing for England is the best job in the world" said James Anderson. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761389_1_20240713002102.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England great James Anderson said he felt "really proud" after bringing down the curtain on a remarkable Test career with a thumping win over the West Indies at Lord's.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His final appearance before international retirement saw the 41-year-old paceman take a typically frugal 3-32 in 16 overs as the West Indies were dismissed for just 136 on Friday to give England victory by an innings and 114 runs inside three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England selectors had already agreed with Anderson that this first of a three-match series would represent his farewell to national on-field service as they look to rebuild ahead of the 2025/26 Ashes series in Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anderson, now set to mentor England's quicks for the rest of the season, bowed out with a remarkable 704 wickets from 188 Tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only spinners Shane Warne (708 Test wickets) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800) have enjoyed more bowling success at this level, with India batting hero Sachin Tendulkar (200 matches) the lone cricketer to have played more Tests than Anderson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been quite an amazing week," Anderson told Sky Sports. "I've been overwhelmed with the reaction of the crowd and everyone around the ground, and the lads as well. I'm just proud of what I've achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously this morning was quite emotional with the two teams lined up, and the reaction from the crowd was pretty special. I'm still trying to hold them (tears) back now but I think I am just really proud," added Anderson after ending his Test career where it started – with a debut against Zimbabwe at Lord's in 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for 20-odd years is an incredible effort, especially for a fast bowler, so I'm just happy that I've made it this far, happy that I've been lucky enough to stay injury-free pretty much throughout my career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for England is the best job in the world and I've been privileged to do it for a long time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England captain Ben Stokes hailed Anderson by saying: "He has just been an incredible inspiration to so many people...The amount of games and the amount of wickets he's taken are just absolutely phenomenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes you can be lost for words but if you gave me 15 minutes I wouldn't be able to compliment him enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a sense of a torch being passed at Lord's, with debutant fast bowler Gus Atkinson named player of the match following a sensational haul of 12-106.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By taking 12 wickets in his first Test, he managed something Anderson was unable to achieve in 188, with the Lancashire swing specialist's best match return at this level 11-71 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an incredible week," said Atkinson. "I just want to say thanks to Jimmy. Playing here in his last Test has been incredible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Surrey quick, asked if he had idolised Anderson as a child, replied: "A hundred percent. Growing up Jimmy was someone I would come to Lord's and watch. I was standing at mid-off thinking I had seen that so many times on the TV. It was amazing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite summed up many an opposition batsman's view of Anderson by saying: "He is a legend of the game. I won't miss him at all!" (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory over the final straight on Thursday to complete Stage 12 of the Tour de France in Villeneuve-sur-Lot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Girmay of Eritrea outlasted Wout van Aert of Belgium and Arnaud Demare of France to finish in 4 hours, 17 minutes, 15 seconds and capture his third stage of the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Ackermann of Germany ended up in third after Demare was demoted to 67th place for pushing van Aert to the barriers during the 204-km stage that brought riders from Aurillac to Villeneuve-sur-Lot in southwestern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time Grand Tour champion Primoz Roglic of Slovenia was involved in his second crash in as many days, with Thursday's slip-up coming near the finish line. Roglic finished 2:27 after Girmay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, there were no changes atop the leaderboard. Two-time Tour champion Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia retained the yellow jersey, 1:06 ahead of Belgium's Remco Evenepoel and 1:14 ahead of two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark.

    Krejcikova stuns Rybakina, faces Paolini in final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Barbora Krejcikova celebrates after beating Elena Rybakina on Centre Court at Wimbledon. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761246_1_20240712035538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in the Wimbledon final after battling back for a shock 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over former champion Elena Rybakina on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just hours after Paolini beat tearful Croatian Donna Vekic 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10/8) in the longest ever women's semi-final at the All England Club, it was Krejcikova's turn to dig deep for victory against fourth seeded Rybakina in two hours and seven minutes on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova faces seventh seed Paolini on Saturday in what will be the second Grand Slam final of the 28-year-old's career after her French Open triumph in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud about my game and my fighting spirit today," said Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech started 2024 with a run to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, but a first round exit at the French Open was a major setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She struggled with a back injury and illness, winning just three singles matches in the five months before finally finding her form in remarkable style at Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova shocked 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round and former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals, before turning her sights on Rybakina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-time Wimbledon doubles champion is now one win away from an unexpected triumph in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unbelievable. It is very tough to explain, but a lot of joy and a lot of emotions," Krejcikova said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I broke her in the second set, I started to be in the zone and I didn't want to leave the zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rybakina had been in formidable form, dropping just one set as she extended her impressive All England Club record to 19 wins from 21 matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old, who won Wimbledon in 2022, made a fast start with two quick breaks for an early 4-0 lead in a one-sided first set against Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her first Wimbledon semi-final, Krejcikova turned the tide in the second set, landing a priceless break in the sixth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She levelled the match on her sixth set point, making it the first time in 20 years that both Wimbledon women's semi-finals had gone to the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech held all the momentum and she eventually wore down Rybakina, who had committed over 35 unforced errors by the time she surrendered her serve in the decisive, seventh game of the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini had never won a main draw match at Wimbledon before this year, but the world number seven tenaciously saw off Vekic in two hours and 51 minutes to secure a second successive Grand Slam final appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old, who lost the French Open final to Iga Swiatek last month, is the first Italian woman to reach the Wimbledon final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini, who also made the Australia Open last 16 in January, had not gone past the second round in any Slam before this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without a win at the All England Club heading into the tournament, Paolini now has six victories under her belt and has dropped just two sets in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last months have been crazy for me. It is a dream. I was watching finals when I was a kid on this Wimbledon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know there is no place better than here to fight for every ball and every point. I will remember this forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vekic paid the price for 57 unforced errors, with the semi-final fittingly ending on another wild forehand from the unseeded Croatian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unable to contain her frustration at letting 3-1 and 4-3 leads slip in the last set, Vekic broke down in tears in the closing stages of a rollercoaster clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was crying because I had so much pain. I didn't know how I could keep playing," Vekic said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I was going to die in the third set. I had so much pain in my arm, in my leg." (AFP)

    Colombia to meet Argentina in Copa America final

<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uruguay's Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia went down to 10 men just before half-time when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ollie Watkins struck a stunning injury-time winner as England beat the Netherlands 2-1 on Wednesday to set up a Euro 2024 final showdown with Spain in Berlin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an incredible finish to an evening that began badly for England, as Xavi Simons gave the Netherlands an early lead in the semi-final in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, England were soon level through a Harry Kane penalty following a contentious VAR call by German referee Felix Zwayer, and the match looked set for extra time until Watkins struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On for Kane, Watkins received a pass from fellow substitute Cole Palmer with his back to goal in the first minute of stoppage time, turned and fired low into the far corner to leave the Netherlands bewildered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm lost for words really," said Watkins, the Aston Villa striker. "I don't think I've hit a ball that sweet before, and obviously in such a special moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has rarely been a convincing campaign from Gareth Southgate's England side, but they are through to their second consecutive European Championship final as they dream of finally winning a first major trophy since 1966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To do that they will surely have to perform better than at any point so far in Germany as they face an outstanding Spain team, who beat France 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands had been hoping to repeat their triumph at the last Euros in Germany, in 1988, but their current side lacks anyone with the star quality of Marco van Basten or Ruud Gullit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A victory for them would have seen this Euros conclude with the same final as the 2010 World Cup. Instead they now go home. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) on Wednesday formally named a star-studded 592-member team for this month's Olympic Games in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US squad, which is comprised of 314 female athletes and 278 male athletes, will be aiming to top the Olympic medal table for a fourth straight games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team includes Olympic stars such as gymnast Simone Biles, swimmer Katie Ledecky and NBA icon LeBron James.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with immense pride and excitement that we announce the 2024 US Olympic Team and the exceptional athletes that embody the spirit of dedication, resilience, and excellence, continuing the proud history of Team USA at the Olympic Games," USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US team includes more than 250 returning Olympians, including three five-time Olympians, four four-time Olympians and 16 three-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The squad includes 122 Olympic medallists, including 66 Olympic champions who boast a combined 110 gold medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forty-five athletes on the team have won multiple Olympic medals, while 23 have won multiple Olympic golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The youngest member of the team is gymnast Hezly Rivera, who turned 16 on June 4, while the oldest member of the squad is equestrian Steffen Peters, the 59-year-old German-born rider who first represented the United States at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. (AFP)

    Musetti through to semi-final, Djokovic gets free pass

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Musetti celebrates after winning his quarter-final match against Taylor Fritz. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761090_2_20240711081337.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lorenzo Musetti threw his head back and spread his arms wide to celebrate reaching his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon, then covered his face with both hands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25th-seeded Musetti, a 22-year-old from Italy, never had made it past the third round at the All England Club – or past the fourth round at any major tournament – until this fortnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He defeated 13th-seeded American Taylor Fritz 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, though, comes a far tougher test – taking on Novak Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic earlier progressed to a record-equalling 13th Wimbledon semi-final without hitting a ball on Wednesday after Alex de Minaur pulled out injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian ninth seed De Minaur, 25, announced shortly after midday at the All England Club that he was "devastated to pull out due to a hip injury."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means Djokovic has now equalled Roger Federer's men's record of 13 semi-final appearances at Wimbledon as he closes on the Swiss great's mark of eight singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Serbian is also through to a record-extending 49th men's Grand Slam semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Minaur, who beat Djokovic at the United Cup in January, said: "It's no secret that this would have been the biggest match of my career but it's a unique injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I woke up this morning wanting to feel some sort of miracle, but there was a high risk of making the injury worse if I stepped on court. One stretch, one slide could take this from a three to six weeks' injury to four months out."
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi was on target as 2022 world champions Argentina turned on the style to beat Canada 2-0 on Tuesday and reach the Copa America final where they will look for a third straight major title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-times Copa champions produced their best display of the tournament in front of a capacity crowd at the 82,500 MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina soaked up some early pressure before Julian Alvarez ghosted in between two defenders to open the scoring with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Messi had chances throughout the match and doubled the lead in the 51st minute when he stuck out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The truth is that it's crazy what this group has done, what the Argentina national team has been doing," Messi told TyC Sports after his first goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not easy for us to be in a final again, for us to compete again to be champions. I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum," said the 37-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defending Copa champions will face the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Uruguay and Colombia in what will be a highly anticipated final in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit," said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight," he added. (Agencies)

    Alcaraz, Medvedev set up semi-final repeat, Sinner out

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev set up a Wimbledon semi-final repeat on Tuesday, while Daniil Medvedev defeated world number one Jannik Sinner to reach a second successive Wimbledon final four.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz battled back from a set down to defeat Tommy Paul 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 while Medvedev stunned world number one Jannik Sinner, who suffered a mid-match health scare, 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish world number three Alcaraz, seeking a fourth Grand Slam title, was broken twice by 12th-seeded Paul in a 72-minute first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three breaks in the third set put the Spaniard in charge and he stepped up another gear in the fourth, making just four unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, seeking to become just the sixth man to capture the French Open and Wimbledon titles back to back, defeated Medvedev in straights sets in last year's Wimbledon semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniil Medvedev defeated world number one Jannik Sinner in five sets on Tuesday to reach a second successive Wimbledon semi-final, subduing the gallant challenge of the Italian, who suffered a worrying mid-match health scare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth-ranked Medvedev triumphed 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3 to avenge his Australian Open final loss to Sinner in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His four-hour victory also ended a five-match losing streak against the Italian as Medvedev reached his ninth Grand Slam semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a tight first set in which neither man gave up a break point, Medvedev edged ahead in the tie-break on the back of a lung-busting 33-shot rally. However, he squandered a set point and his game suddenly fell apart, serving up a double fault as Sinner pocketed the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mercurial Russian carved out the only break of the second set in the third game on his way to levelling the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner slipped another break down at 2-1 in the third set and immediately summoned the tournament physio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian, appearing distressed, had his blood pressure taken courtside before he left for a medical time-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a 10-minute delay, the 22-year-old resumed play and thrilled the Centre Court crowd when he bravely clawed his way back to 5-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Italian was undaunted and levelled the quarter-final on the back of breaks in the third and fifth games of the fourth set. But it was Medvedev finished the fresher of the two players, breaking in the final set on his way to victory. (AFP)

    Yamal makes history as Spain reach Euro 2024 final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Yamal becomes the youngest-ever scorer in a European Championship. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760947_1_20240710062439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain struck twice in five minutes in a pulsating first half to secure a 2-1 comeback win over France on Tuesday as a record-breaking goal from teenager Lamine Yamal and a Dani Olmo effort propelled them into the Euro 2024 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani's opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, confirmed their favourites tag with another display of attacking football, especially in the first half, that is a far cry from the tiki-taka passing game that earned them world and European titles more than a decade ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will now face the winners of Wednesday's match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a anti-climactic end to France's tournament, although the 2022 World Cup finalists never lived up to expectations in Germany with a very low conversion rate that carried into the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was deflected in by France's Jules Kounde.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they could not carve out an equaliser with Spain, pulling back and successfully soaking up the pressure. (Reuters)

    Ex-Liverpool striker Bellamy appointed Wales manager

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Craig Bellamy says he is keen to get started with their Nations League games. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760928_1_20240710003437.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Craig Bellamy has been appointed as the new head coach of the Wales national football team on a contract until 2028, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bellamy has replaced Rob Page, who was sacked following Wales' failure to qualify for Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 44-year-old former Liverpool, Newcastle and Wales striker leaves Burnley, where he was assistant to former manager Vincent Kompany last season as they were relegated from the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will give my full commitment to develop this team and I am passionate to bring continued success into Welsh football," Bellamy told the FAW website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't wait to get started with our Nations League games in September."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FAW's chief football officer, Dr David Adams, said: "I am absolutely delighted to announce Craig as our new head coach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We undertook a thorough recruitment process for the new men's national team head coach and Craig was identified as the standout candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are all looking forward to the Nations League games and working with Craig to deliver success for Welsh Football."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley chairman Alan Pace added: "I want to thank Craig for all his hard work during his time at Burnley and wish him the best for his new position as Wales manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Craig has been a very important part of our wonderful journey the last two years. I've admired his leadership, knowledge and passion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Page guided Wales to their first World Cup in 64 years in 2022 and to the second round of Euro 2020 but failed to reach this year's Euros, losing in a penalty shoot-out to Poland in a play-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he subsequently oversaw one of the most embarrassing results in Wales' history, a 0-0 draw with Gibraltar in a friendly and then suffered a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Slovakia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wales' next game is the opening match of their Nations League campaign against Turkey on September 6, with a trip to Montenegro three days later. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday held a flag presentation ceremony for the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics ahead of the start of the Games later this month, with Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan announcing higher rewards to further motivate athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I’m glad to learn about the Jockey Club Athlete Incentive Awards Scheme, which will increase the reward for athletes. There will be a 20 percent increase in cash incentives in total compared with the last Olympics. For example, the reward for an individual gold medallist will be raised to HK$6 million. This is a great way to motivate our athletes to strive for better results,” he said at the ceremony at the government headquarters in Tamar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also revealed that due to the rising temperatures in Paris, the administration plans to provide air conditioners for athletes competing there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The order's been placed, the equipment's on its way… I'm going there on July 22nd, and I anticipate that all our rooms [will] have the air conditioning,” said Brian Stevenson, Chef de Mission for the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending a delegation of about 90 people to Paris. Among them are 35 athletes, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Épée fencer Vivian Kong, who narrowly missed out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is now heading to Paris as the world number one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said her mindset has changed since the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the biggest difference between these three years is that Tokyo gave me a lot of time to reflect on why I want to train, why I want to become better, why I want to win, because it doesn't seem to matter if people aren't healthy, if people aren't happy. There are more important things than sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think this time in Paris we can really enjoy sports... Hopefully everyone's healthy again and that it gives more purpose and motivation for me to do well.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For veteran swimmer Camille Cheng, this will be her third Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her family will be in Paris to see her in action in the Games for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think about this time of the season as really the fun part of the season. We've put in the hard work. It's all about the small details, fine-tuning things, focusing on recovery," Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And really, I think more than anything, it's about mentally so that you're in a happy place, that you're surrounded by positive energy... because for me I believe that a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sprinter Felix Diu made the final cut to the Olympics through a wild-card. The 100m specialist and first-time Olympian said his goal is to achieve a personal best at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My expectation for the Olympics is to get a [personal best time] for like 10.3 or 10.2 seconds,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Wai-fung, another Olympic debutant, secured Hong Kong's first-ever Taekwondo Olympic qualification. While excited about that, he said he feels the pressure of representing all the Taekwondo enthusiasts in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes to bring home a medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will be held from July 26 to August 11.

    Djokovic blasts fans' 'disrespect' at Wimbledon

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic accused Wimbledon fans of "disrespect" in a withering on-court tirade after reaching a 60th Grand Slam quarter-final and 15th at the All England Club on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number two Djokovic, the seven-time champion at Wimbledon and chasing a record-setting 25th major, defeated 15th-ranked Holger Rune 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic then launched a bitter outburst at a section of Centre Court fans who constantly chanted "Rune" throughout the match, echoing the shouts of "Root", popularised by cricket fans in the country in support of former England cricket skipper Joe Root.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To all the fans that have had respect and stayed here tonight, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I appreciate it," said an angry Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And to all those people that have chosen to disrespect the player–in this case me – have a goooooooood night," he added, mocking his tormentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When told by the TV interviewer that some fans were shouting "Rune" rather than booing, Djokovic hit back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were. They were. I am not accepting it. No no no. I know they were cheering for Rune but that's an excuse to also boo," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Listen, I have been on the tour for more than 20 years. I know all the tricks. I focus on the respectful people that pay for the ticket, and love tennis and appreciate the players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have played in much more hostile environments, trust me – you guys can't touch me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic goes on to face Australian ninth seed Alex de Minaur for a place in the semi-finals. (AFP)

    Alcaraz, Sinner stay on course for Wimbledon meeting

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates after his fourth round win. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760631_1_20240708075038.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Carlos Alcaraz defeated French 16th seed Ugo Humbert 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to make the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for the ninth time in just 14 appearances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, it was another uncomfortable afternoon for the Spaniard, who had needed five sets to see off Frances Tiafoe in the third round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His erratic performance on Sunday saw him drop serve five times and commit an uncharacteristic 33 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old, bidding to become just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back, eased through the first set under the Centre Court roof before crucially saving four break points in the fifth game of the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will be there, fighting until the last ball," said Alcaraz, who is chasing a fourth Grand Slam title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz will take on American 12th seed Tommy Paul, who beat Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over on Court One, top seed Sinner moved into the last-eight with a 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (11/9) win over American 14th seed Ben Shelton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner, who won his maiden Slam crown at the Australian Open this year, will face Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev for a place in the semi-finals in a rematch of their final in Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a tough match, especially the third set. I had to keep saving set points," said Sinner, a semi-finalist in 2023. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kenya's Faith Kipyegon celebrates after winning the women's 1,500m to set a new world record. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760618_1_20240708014703.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Kenyan Faith Kipyegon hit world record-breaking form at Sunday's Diamond League meet in Paris in the perfect boost before the Olympics kick off in three weeks' time in the French capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mahuchikh broke the 37-year-old women's high jump world record, while Kipyegon improved her own record in the women's 1,500m, two results that will make them two of the stars to watch in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion Mahuchikh set a new best of 2.10m, beating by 1cm the record set by Bulgaria's Stefka Kostadinova at the 1987 world championships in Rome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Coming into this competition, I had feelings that I could jump 2.07m and maybe 2.10m," said Mahuchikh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finally, I signed Ukraine into the history of world athletics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1,500m, led out by two pacemakers, two-time defending Olympic champion Kipyegon broke to the front and clocked 3min 49.04sec in a superb display of running. It improved by 0.07sec her previous best set in Florence in June 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wow this is just amazing! I am so happy to break the world record over my favourite distance again," said Kipyegon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't wait to come back to Paris to defend my Olympic title!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armand "Mondo" Duplantis went close in a bid to better his own pole vault world record in an afternoon of top-class track and field that featured a stunning men's 800m, while French decathlete Kevin Mayer took a worrying tumble in the 110m hurdles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a distinctly Olympic tinge to proceedings at a packed Stade Charlety in southern Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stadium was awash with tricolour flags, Olympic mascots and a lot of blue after organisers asked fans to come dressed in the colour to support home athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not work for decathlon world record holder Mayer, who tumbled to the ground in the hurdles, the third event of a triathlon also including the shot put and long jump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayer received medical attention before being helped off the track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In better news for the hosts, Sasha Zhoya equalled his personal best of 13.15sec to win the 110m hurdles in a photo finish from American Trey Cunningham. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lewis Hamilton held off Max Verstappen in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday for a first victory since Saudi Arabia in December 2021.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I've been waiting for this," shouted Briton Hamilton after crossing the line in his Mercedes to claim a ninth victory at Silverstone, breaking a tie with Michael Schumacher for most wins at one track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris of McLaren was third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After his record-extending 104th Formula One victory, the 39-year-old Hamilton wept as he fell into the arms of his father as the home crowd roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since 2021, every day fighting, training and putting my mind to the task, working as hard as I can," Hamilton, who will be moving to Ferrari after this season, said at the finish line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is my last race for the team here, I love them so much, I'll be forever grateful to everyone at Mercedes and to the incredible fans."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton, who started second on the grid behind his teammate George Russell, recorded his 13th consecutive podium at his home track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell, the winner a week earlier in Austria, was forced out with a hydraulic problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton overtook Russell on lap 18 but was passed by Norris two laps later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a poorly executed McLaren pit stop allowed Hamilton to regain the lead with 12 laps remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton finished 1.465sec ahead of Verstappen who overtook Norris three laps from the finish as the race ended in sunshine after a brief shower during the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's Verstappen increased his lead in the drivers' standings over Norris by three points to 84 points despite failing to win for two consecutive races for the first time since Silverstone and Austria in 2022.
  <br/>

    South Korea names Hong Myung-bo as coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong returns as South Korea coach 10 years after stepping down. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760593_1_20240707170820.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former coach and captain Hong Myung-bo will return to guide South Korea's national men's football team, the governing body said on Sunday, five months after the dismissal of Jurgen Klinsmann.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We have signed Hong as our next national team head coach," a spokesman for the Korea Football Association (KFA) told AFP, declining to give any details of Hong's contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann, a World Cup winner as a player in 1990, was dismissed after South Korea's disappointing semi-final exit from the Asian Cup in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong returns as South Korea coach 10 years after stepping down in the wake of the team's group-stage exit from the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong, 55, is celebrated as one of South Korea's greatest football players. As a defender, he captained the South to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup, which South Korea co-hosted with Japan, and scored the decisive penalty in a quarter-final shootout against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann was dismissed after only a year in the job following a 2-0 Asian Cup defeat by underdogs Jordan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just before his sacking, it emerged there had been a bust-up on the eve of the semi-final loss between Tottenham striker Son Heung-min and Lee Kang-in of Paris Saint-Germain, leaving Son with a dislocated finger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann later said in an interview with The Athletic that he and his coaching staff were made "responsible for the fight".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The KFA's leading target to replace Klinsmann, former Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch, chose to coach Canada instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governing body also reportedly talked to Iraq's Spanish coach Jesus Casas, with 71-year-old Senol Gunes from Turkey and former Saudi Arabia coach Herve Renard also in the picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea, led by Son as captain, played the past four World Cup qualifier matches under two interim coaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong will guide the national squad through the final stages of qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, to be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An own goal by Mert Muldur completed a dramatic comeback for the Netherlands on Saturday as they overcame a tenacious Turkey 2-1 to book a Euro 2024 semi-final meeting with England.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defender bundled the ball into his own net in the 76th minute under pressure from Cody Gakpo as the Dutch bounced back from a poor first-half display to win a bruising clash and complete the final four line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stefan de Vrij had equalised only six minutes earlier after Turkey went into the break 1-0 up from Samet Akaydin’s 35th- minute header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey rode waves of passionate support at the Olympiastadion to get on course for an unlikely semi-final place but, after keeping the Dutch at bay they finally succumbed to the pressure in the last 20 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France and Spain meet in the other semi-final on Tuesday before the Dutch face England in Dortmund on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only one of the weekend’s quarter-finals to be completed without extra time or penalties was no less drama-filled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey’s goal came after a strange decision from Dutch fullback Denzel Dumfries to let a shot, which had clearly deflected off Nathan Ake, go out for a corner when he could easily have kept the ball in play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The resultant set piece was initially cleared but fell for teenager Arda Guler to deliver a perfect cross to the back post and Akaydin was first in a queue of three Turkish players to rise and head home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goal came after sustained pressure from Turkey, who had seen off early Dutch dominance, to set up several opportunities, including a succession of corners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial enterprise from the Dutch was met with tenacious defence as Turkey giving their opponents little room to play in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not help the Dutch cause that attackers Memphis Depay and Gakpo looked flat, prompting coach Ronald Koeman into throwing on pinch hitter Wout Weghorst at the start of the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the imposing centre forward looked to sew panic among the Turkish defenders, however, it was at the other end that the next opportunities arose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guler’s 56th-minute free kick was bent expertly around the Dutch wall but struck the outside of the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten minutes later, Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen got a hand to deny Baris Alper Yilmaz’s stinging shot and Kaan Ayhan missed out on tucking away the rebound as Weghorst cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch kept plugging away and, as Turkey’s defence became more scrambled, they finally made the breakthrough with Depay’s cross finding an unmarked De Vrij to head home in the 70th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege continued and it was matter of time before the Dutch grab a second, bundled in six minutes later as Gakpo pressurised Muldur after a cross by Dumfries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tired-looking Turks, drawing last vestiges of energy from rabid support from the majority of the capacity crowd, gamely sought to take the game into extra time but had desperate efforts blocked by the Orange defence and Verbruggen made another key save in stoppage time. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barely a week after furious fans hurled beer cups and insults at Gareth Southgate, the England manager danced with his players in front of the team's supporters on Saturday after a thrilling shootout victory launched them into the Euro 2024 semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Southgate's men defeated Switzerland 5-3 on penalties after regulation ended 1-1, with Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka scoring a brilliant equalizer when he cut in from the right wing and curled a blistering 20-metre left-footed shot in off the far post following Breel Embolo's opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate's 100th game as England boss was his team's best in an uninspiring tournament that has seen the 53-year-old come under fire and speculation swirl about his future in the job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every now and then you think 'Surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job?'. So if I can't enjoy that moment, then the whole thing is a waste of time," the normally unflappable Southgate said, on letting loose to dance with his players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win put England in their third semi-final in four tournaments, where they will face either Turkey or the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I love the players, I love being in that moment with them. I took this job to try and improve English football. I wanted us to regain credibility on a world stage. So I can't deny that when it's as personal as it's been in the last few weeks on a human level, that's quite difficult," Southgate said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we're fighting. We're not going to stop fighting. And as I said, we're in another semi-final and we'll see where we can get to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka, Ivan Toney and Trent Alexander-Arnold converted from the penalty spot to clinch the win. The Liverpool defender joyously grabbed the ball as it rebounded out of the goal and booted it high into the air as his teammates hurtled forward in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were watching the (Spain-Germany) game last night and I spoke to them about it, just about playing well. Spain mixed their game up. They took seven yellow cards. They found ways to win," Southgate said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These players are showing all those other attributes, dealing with everything that's around us. Twice coming from behind in games, now a penalty shootout where their composure was impeccable. So I'm so, so proud of them.

  "I gave him a massive cuddle on the pitch," the manager said. "He's a special boy. He's a dream to work with. Wonderful family. And, of course, you're pleased for everybody, but for him especially when his went in." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Adrian Newey, the much-coveted designer who is leaving Red Bull, will not make any announcement on his future until September at the earliest - and may delay a decision until the end of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newey, 65, has been linked to Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Williams and Aston Martin, since saying he wanted to leave Red Bull where he has won 13 world titles in nearly two decades of success with the team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has suggested he will continue to work in Formula One and may not make a final decision until later this year after easing off "to focus on final development and delivery of Red Bull's first hyper-car, the RB17", as revealed by Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know. At the moment, I'm just kind of still working on the RB17, our track car, and just taking some time off, Newey told Sky Sports F1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last week, actually, we took seven days and had lucky timing with the weather and went around the south coast with our dogs in an old Aston Martin DB6. Great fun!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if he had to decide his future by a deadline at the end of the year, he said, "That's certainly the target. I'll need to have my mind up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newey, widely regarded as a guru of ground effect technology, is expected to leave Red Bull finally in March next year, allowing him to take part in the development of a new car for the new 2026 regulations with whichever team he joins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was reported to have had a tour of Aston Martin's factory last month and has been in negotiations with them, but any deal with the ambitious Silverstone team is unlikely to be announced before September to comply with his contract at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aston Martin last week recruited the highly-rated former Mercedes engine boss Andy Cowell to take over as group chief executive officer, replacing Martin Whitmarsh in October. (AFP)

    Winning all that matters at Euro 2024 for Mbappe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Portugal's forward Cristiano Ronaldo embraces France's Kylian Mbappe prior to the UEFA Euro 2024 quarter-final match. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760540_1_20240706221117.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three goals scored in five games, one a penalty and two own goals, and yet Kylian Mbappe's France are into the semi-finals of yet another major tournament as Spain await at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is remarkable that any team could get to the last four of such a competition despite struggling so much in front of goal, but all the more so when that team is captained by arguably the best forward in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe is surrounded by other world-class attackers, but his penalty in a group-stage draw with Poland is the only goal scored by a French player at this European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having edged Belgium in the last 16 thanks to a late own goal, France came through a nail-biting quarter-final against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal on Friday, triumphing 5-3 on penalties after a goalless two hours of football in Hamburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have said it before lots of competitions. The most important thing is that we win," Mbappe told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People thought it was a wisecrack. I have only scored one goal but we are in the semi-finals and I am really happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In charge for 12 years and at his sixth major tournament, France coach Didier Deschamps has regularly been criticised for not playing thrilling football with an extraordinary collection of players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he has always got results, with France winning the 2018 World Cup and 2021 UEFA Nations League under his watch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They lost the 2022 World Cup final on penalties to Argentina and the Euro 2016 final in extra time against Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now they are in a fourth semi-final in the last five major tournaments despite their paltry record in front of goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece may be remembered as perhaps the least spectacular side to win such a competition, but their status as outsiders at Euro 2004 justified a more cautious approach, and they still scored seven goals in six matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including their 0-0 friendly draw against Canada just before the Euros, France have gone six games without one of their players finding the net in open play, a first in 60 years according to statisticians Opta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That record has not prevented them advancing to the semi-final against a Spain side who have found the net 11 times in Germany. (AFP)

    All Blacks edge England 16-15 in bruising encounter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England's George Martin is tackled by New Zealand's Sevu Reece during the rugby union Test match between the New Zealand All Blacks and England at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760528_1_20240706190400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damian McKenzie landed two late penalties as New Zealand beat England 16-15 in the first Test on Saturday to make a winning start to the tenure of new coach Scott Robertson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks held their nerve in a brutal defensive contest in Dunedin in which both teams scored two tries, extending their winning run on home soil against England to eight matches since 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It took a grinding effort in the second half to secure victory after England winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso scored a try to break a 10-10 deadlock at the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks struggled to penetrate a disciplined England defence and never threatened a try in the second half, but they did enough to set up McKenzie for penalty goals in the 54th and 65th minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie was timed out when lining up a third penalty attempt in the dying stages but England failed to score from the final play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks came into the game after just 10 days under former Canterbury Crusaders mentor Robertson, who succeeded Ian Foster after the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had also lost a handful of experienced players -- retired or playing abroad -- in the wake of their World Cup final loss to South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coming off a 52-17 win over Japan two weeks earlier, England played with great cohesion but also struggled to create try-scoring chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither team led by more than five points throughout an absorbing contest dominated by the physicality of the collisions and some confusion on rulings made by Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England fly-half Marcus Smith missed an early penalty before All Blacks winger Sevu Reece opened the scoring with a try after fielding a McKenzie cross-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors struck back through a close range try by lock Maro Itoje but New Zealand regained the ascendancy when 2023 World Player of Year Ardie Savea capitalised on a break from full-back Stephen Perofeta to score in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand conceded a penalty after the half-time hooter which was slotted by Smith to square the scores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England dominated the opening exchanges after the break and created space for Feyi-Waboso to cross in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England prop Joe Marler could be in doubt for the second Test in Auckland next week after exiting early with a foot complaint while All Blacks scrum-half TJ Perenara didn't return from the half-time break following a knee injury. (AFP)
