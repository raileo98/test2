<div class="itemFullText">
 It was another action packed day on Monday at the Olympics in Paris with Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung making history for Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung distinguished himself with the successful defence of his Olympic title in the men's individual foil while Haughey won a consecutive medal in the 200 free.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king Edgar Cheung defended his Olympic gold medal in men's foil in dramatic fashion after making a brilliant comeback in the final match against Italian Filippo Macchi in the early hours of Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian pulled ahead 14-12, but Cheung immediately gained two points to bring the game into a tie-breaker for the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the score tied at 14-14, the fencing got even more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On two occasions, both fencers thought they had won the last point, but the judges said it was too close to rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After three attempts to break the tie, Cheung took home the win for Hong Kong, China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he couldn't believe he's the first athlete to repeat in men's foil in 68 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe [that I've won]...and being the first man to repeat in so long, actually, I really rather can't believe it," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of the best moments in my life. To have a gold medal in France, with a French coach, for me it's a wonderful day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he woke up not feeling too good, and he didn't feel he too good before entering the bout - but when he fenced, it was different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said coach Greg Koenig told him not to focus on the judges' decisions late in the game, and focus on the next move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach, for his part, said he never doubted that Cheung could overcome his deficit at 11-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three last points, to be honest, I know he can do it. I will stay positive. I will send him my maximum positive energy because I know, three points in a row for him is absolutely nothing," Koenig said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory helped him claim his second gold in as many Games and becomes the first athlete from the SAR to grab consecutive Olympic titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong now has two gold medals in Paris, all in fencing, the most ever won at a single Games so far.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Siobhan Haughey gives Australia's Mollie O'Callaghan a congratulatory hug after the 200 free final. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763766_1_20240730042314.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey won a consecutive medal in the women's 200m freestyle, earning bronze on top of the silver she won in Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong star was among the first to turn at the half-way point before her Australian rivals Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus turned up the heat in the second 100 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Callaghan pulled away from Titmus and Haughey in the last lap to win in an Olympic record time of 1 minute, 53.27 seconds, 0.54 seconds ahead of defending champion Titmus who settled for silver while Haughey picked up the bronze in a time of 1 minute, 54.55.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said after the race that her time wasn't as good as she thought it would be, but she's still satisfied with the result, saying the Australian swimmers were really strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said it was a special moment for her because when she won silvers in Tokyo, there were no spectators because of Covid, and she's glad that her parents were among many in the crowd cheering her on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star swimmer also thanked Hongkongers for staying up to support her and other SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you so much for everyone who's been waking up really early to watch our races, our matches and competitions," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really been on social media a lot these past few days, but I've received everyone's messages and all the love and support, so, thank you so much and please keep supporting us because it means the world to us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Haughey's third Olympic medal following the two silvers she won in the 100m and 200m freestyle events at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is due to compete in the women's 100m free on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Summer McIntosh set the pool alight at La Defense Arena in Paris, with a commanding victory in the women's 400m individual medley.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Canadian won in a time of 4 minutes, 27.71 seconds, ahead of American silver medallist Katie Grimes and her bronze-winning US teammate Emma Weyant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh's triumph comes two days after taking silver behind Australian powerhouse Ariarne Titmus in the 400m freestyle on the meet's opening on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, the men's 200m freestyle a closely fought battle between at least six swimmers in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, it was Romanian teenager David Popovici who powered to the gold medal on Monday, edging Britain's Matthew Richards by a fingertip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old touched in 1 minute 44.72 seconds ahead of Richards who took silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Luke Hobson took bronze in a frantic finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was Popovici's first Olympic medal after missing out in Tokyo where he came fourth and he also became the first Romanian male to win an Olympic gold in swimming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another gold for Italy as world record holder Thomas Ceccon won the men's 100m backstroke gold at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Xu Jiayu took silver, with 2016 gold medallist Ryan Murphy of the US taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also won silver in the women's 100m breaststroke as Tang Qianting finished just behind Tatjana Smith of South Africa who added the 100 breast title to the 200m gold she won in Tokyo three years ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese men's gymnastic team took home silver at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Tuesday, as two falls from one of the gymnasts in the final round proved to be too costly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japan took gold on 259.594 points, a little more than half a point ahead of China. The United States got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China led by more than three points heading into the final round, with Xiao Ruoteng, Su Weide and Zhang Boheng up on the horizontal bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su slipped and lost his grip on the bar twice in his routine, for a subpar score of 11.6. Zhang was unable to make up for the deficit in the last routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China had taken the lead after the first three rotations, with exceptional performances on the rings, led by Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Liu Yang, and strong scores on the horse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan and Zhang then extended the advantage with slick moves on the parallel bars, with Zou getting 16 points on the apparatus, the highest individual score in the entire event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su had a night to forget as his slips also meant the chance at gold faded away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese themselves had to overcome a poor start to the competition to capture gold in the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China snatched bronzes in the same event at both the Tokyo and Rio Olympics.

  “He really could control his emotions. He showed real maturity in his fencing. Whatever the score was, he was really focused so it was amazing,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We still have one more match. We came here for the gold and we will give the maximum for the gold.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be the second fencing medal for Hong Kong, China, given Cheung is guaranteed at least a silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also means Cheung becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to have a chance at defending their Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If he wins, Cheung would be the first man to defend an Olympic foil title since 1956.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will face Italian Filippo Macchi in the final at 4.10am Hong Kong time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s windsurfers were finally able to make some waves in the south of France, with Mui Ma ranking fourth after finishing her first day of Olympic races.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma finished sixth and fifth in her two races respectively. There are five races in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her fellow windsurfer Alex Cheng ranked 20th after his first race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR’s skiff sailors, Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth, remained in second to last place after completing half of their races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The windsurfing competitions were postponed for a day due to a lack of wind down in Marseilles.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis stars Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting will play for a mixed doubles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, after losing to North Korea's pair 3-4 in the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an up and down match, with Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong, the lowest seed in this tournament, starting with a bang and taking the first game 3-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong then took the second game 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth-seeded Hong Kong pair then had a 2-1 edge after winning the third game 11-3. But they dropped the next two, 9-11, 9-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall at the South Paris Arena, Doo and Wong went on to win the sixth game 11-9 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's when the North Koreans went on the attack, as they jumped out to a 7-0 lead behind Ri's strong forehand smashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair fought their way back to make it 6-9, before eventually dropping the final game 6-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Korean giant killers had started the tournament defeating the world number two pair, Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan, in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo will face South Korea's Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon, who lost to China's top-seeded Sun Yingsha and Wang Chuqin in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, Wong said they gave it their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Facing these North Koreans, they're the so-called dark horses. But any team in the final four has to be very good. So actually, when we faced them, we felt we were the dark horses," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So on the table, we fought until the very end, but we failed. We will collect ourselves for the bronze medal match and hopefully we can win a medal for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal match will take place on Tuesday at 7:30pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung overcame a partisan home crowd to edge out Enzo Lefort of France for a place in the semi-finals of the men’s individual foil on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lefort took control in the opening stages, with Cheung ending the first round down 3-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete was able to turn it around early in the second round, but the French fencer fought back, leading to a nail-biting back and forth that ended with the second round score at 13-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, knowing he would go out if he lost another point, scored two quick points in an intense final round to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, taking Hong Kong, China into the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When you fence against a guy who is a two-time world champion, who is playing in his hometown with all the public, of course it’s going to be hard, harder than usual but Ka-long found the psychological resources to put the last point, which is amazing regarding to the match, so I am very, very again proud of what he did,” said coach Gregory Koenig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to understand that even when you are tired, you have enough adrenaline to find the resources. You are tired but the psychological is the most important at this point. Even when you have pain everywhere, you have to think ‘OK I have pain, but this is life, this is how it is, I have to do what I know what to do’ and that is what he did in the last two points. The last two points were amazing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Koenig added that his next opponent Kazuki Iimura of Japan would definitely be a challenge, saying the Japanese fencer might be shorter than Cheung, but he moves very quickly.

    Djokovic downs Nadal in Olympic blockbuster

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Djokovic and Nadal of Spain embrace after their match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763742_1_20240729223953.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic crushed Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in their blockbuster Olympics clash on Monday as the two titans met for the 60th and possibly final time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The showdown between the two most successful men's tennis players in history appeared to be fizzling out before a late fightback from Nadal enabled him to avoid his heaviest-ever defeat by Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very relieved," said Djokovic. "Everything was going my way, I was 6-1, 4-0 up but I played a sloppy service game and gave him chances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic's 31st win in a rivalry that began on the same Roland Garros clay courts in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb added: "I never thought back in 2006 that we'd still be playing each other almost 20 years later."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal admitted Djokovic was the "clear favourite" ahead of their first clash in more than two years, with the Spaniard a shadow of the player who reigned for the best part of two decades at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 14 of Nadal's 22 Grand Slams have come in Paris, the 38-year-old has been plagued by injuries in recent years and he has slumped to 161st in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His participation in the singles in Paris had been in doubt until the last minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic has not had a good season by his stratospherically high standards but the 37-year-old Serbian rose to the occasion in his pursuit of an elusive Olympic gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed raced into a 5-0 lead before Nadal finally got on the board but Djokovic closed out the set and surged 4-0 ahead in the second before Nadal offered some belated resistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal clawed his way back to 4-4 only for Djokovic to break once more, this time making no mistake as he put away his old foe and perhaps brought down the curtain on one of the greatest rivalries in the history of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a bronze medallist on his Olympic debut in 2008, goes on to face Matteo Arnaldi or Dominik Koepfer for a spot in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will turn his focus to the doubles where he is in a dream-team pairing with compatriot Carlos Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the reigning men's French Open and Wimbledon champion, takes on Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor later Monday in the singles. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung advanced to the quarter-finals on Monday, after beating Mo Ziwei of China 15-10 in the last-16 of the men’s individual foil at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is ranked third in the world, started out strong earning himself an early three points to put him ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo was able to fight back, but Cheung maintained good defence to put him at an 8-6 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo then bounced back into the action, but he couldn’t overtake the SAR star, who won in two rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will play host France’s Enzo Lefort in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gregory Koenig said Cheung has to be prepared to face Lefort and a strong home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He has really the perfect mindset. He is self-confident, he knows he can be strong and this is what I want from him. Now as you can see on the table, he will have to fence Enzo Lefort, which is really the ‘chouchou’ of the French public, so it’s going to be hard,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be like in Rio against the Brazilian guy. He has to face off. If you want to become an Olympic champion, you have to face these kind of matches where you have to fence against one guy plus five thousand people of the public, but he will be prepared for this.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Monday flocked to shopping malls and government facilities to watch Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and other SAR athletes in action.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people were at a shopping mall in Kwun Tong to watch the live-stream of the Games on a giant screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the spectators was Valerie, who was there with her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really exciting, because there are people cheering when the athletes won or scored a point. I think this is really different (from) watching at home," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another spectator, Ena, said she was there to cheer on all the Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, their performance has been really motivational to all the Hong Kong citizens. Just wonderful to see more Hong Kong people step into the Olympics, like be the Olympians, and participate in such a big event," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, who was watching Cheung's bouts, said he was moved by the perseverance of the home-grown athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they are so hardworking. They put a lot of efforts on it. We should really support them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and star swimmer Siobhan Haughey are among those in action on day three of the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Sheng Lihao claimed the Paris Olympic title in the men's 10m air rifle event on Monday, adding to his victory in the 10m air rifle mixed team event along with Huang Yuting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sheng, the silver medalist from Tokyo, set an Olympic record with a score of 252.2 points at the Chateauroux Shooting Center.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm quite satisfied with my performance at the Paris Olympics. As you could see, I encountered some difficulties during the competitions, but I managed to hold myself together and complete them," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lindgren of Sweden claimed silver with 251.4 points. He came from behind to eliminate Miran Maricic of Croatia by 0.5 points through the second shot of the penultimate series, scoring 10.6 to Maricic's 9.9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite finishing first in Sunday's qualification round, the 19-year-old Sheng was not at his best, scoring 631.7 points, which is 6.2 points lower than his own world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he responded with a strong start in the final and dominated after three series in the elimination stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two perfect 10.9 shots gave him a 2-point advantage over second-placed Arjun Babuta of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Sheng's lead diminished to 0.6 points before the final series against Lindgren due to two sub-10 shots, he managed a 10.5 and a 10.6 to secure victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the third shooting gold for China at Paris 2024 from five events, and the country's fifth gold overall. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Edgar Cheung on Monday easily booked his spot in the last 16 of men’s foil individual event at the Grand Palais in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer beat Daniel Gu of Canada 15-5 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung went ahead by seven points before his Canadian opponent started striking back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he could not narrow the deficit and Cheung went on to win in the opening three-minute period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This was the plan. We knew this opponent is a strong opponent but I knew if Cheung Ka-long is at his level, he can defeat easily and this was the plan,” said Cheung's coach Gregory Koenig after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will take on China's Mo Zewei next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I really wanted Ka-long to keep focus, to stay focus on every point even if the score was very high difference, to keep focusing, to keep fighting to be fully prepared for the next match, which is going to be to very tough against Mo Ziwei,” Koenig added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gu said he treasured the opportunity to take on an Olympic champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is no point being mad or upset about it. I already knew going into this, I am not a favourite to win, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like to get beat by someone that good,” said Gu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was fun. It is always a learning experience so all the hits and points he gets on me, there is a reason why he is an Olympic champion.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two SAR table tennis players, Wong Chun-ting and Zhu Chengzhu, on Monday won their singles matches at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw, Wong beat Ibrahima Diaw of Senegal in a nail-biter in a round of 64 match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair split the first six games, including a marathon second game lasting 14 minutes in favour of Wong, 18-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong prevailed in the seventh and deciding game, 11-4, to make it through to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, I feel satisfied with my performance today," he said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it was tough, but there were also some surprises... My opponent was in form quickly and acted more decisively, creating a lot of big difficulties for me. So it’s a good thing that I quickly adjusted my game, and luckily I won the second game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Zhu's victory in her round of 64 match was a more straight-forward affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She swept Chien Tung-chuan of Chinese Taipei 11-7, 11-7, 11-7, 12-10.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Cindy Cheung was on Monday eliminated in the first round of women’s 100m backstroke in the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She finished fifth in her heat at the Paris La Defense Arena in 1 min 3.45 secs, which put her 29th among 36 contestants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fastest 16 swimmers qualify for the semifinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff and Regan Smith from the United States and Australian Kaylee McKeown are in the top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though the time isn't the most satisfactory, I will still say it's a great opportunity, and I'm just grateful that I get to finally say that I've competed in the Olympics," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of performance, and may be like handling the nerves, I think there's still much to improve on, that I can learn from other more experienced swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yeah, I'm just here as a learning experience and to enjoy my time here."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A chief surgeon who performed two knee operations on Hong Kong fencing champion Vivian Kong says her Olympic success demonstrates her resilience and determination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Patrick Yung, who chairs the department of orthopaedics and traumatology at Chinese University, said he was moved to see Kong claim a gold medal in Paris at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's moving and touching. Indeed, I witnessed Vivian over the past seven to eight years overcoming all those big and small injuries," he told RTHK in an interview in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After all these years, [going] through all the injuries, all the different setbacks, she champions in the biggest stages in the sports world.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong’s journey to Olympic gold has been filled with ups and downs, after she suffered serious anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung recalled seeing in the newspaper Kong’s return to action just three months after her surgery in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “She didn't tell me, so I called her up and said ‘How come you get back so soon?’ and then she just said 'hehe' and 'Well, I'm okay,' but since then I understand that this girl is very disciplined. She recovers very fast.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung, a long-time honorary medical doctor for the Hong Kong Sports Institute, said Kong’s recovery was exceptionally fast thanks to her unwavering discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have operated on thousands of ACLs, but she's probably the one who got the fastest recovery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, Kong withdrew from the Asian Fencing Championships because of another knee injury. But she recovered in less than a month to defeat Auriane Mallo-Breton in dramatic fashion in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In about a month's time, most people would be okay to walk around with that injury. But if we are talking about competing in the highest level of the sports arena, it's very much demanding. Again she performs another magic,” Yung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago. The top épéeist is the third Hong Kong gold medallist in history, following windsurfer Lee Lai-shan and fellow fencer Edgar Cheung.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey made it to the women’s 200m freestyle final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first 100 metres, Haughey maintained a steady top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to narrow the gap and finished third in the second semi-final of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 minute, 55.51 seconds was the fourth fastest overall, earning her one of eight spots in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final will take place in the early hours of Tuesday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey’s main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday, and Ariarne Titmus, who holds the world and Olympic records in the event and defended her title in the 400m free on the first day of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m free at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago and won the world title in the 200 freestyle earlier this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Adam Peaty was denied in his bid to became the first person to win three consecutive 100m breaststroke titles at the Olympic Games, finishing joint second with America's Nick Fink in a time of 59.05 seconds at La Defense Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Top honours went to Italy's Nicolo Martinenghi who was only 0.02 seconds faster than the Brit and American in a relatively slow final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the second night of swimming got off to a great start for hosts France as swim star Leon Marchand dominated the field in the men's 400m individual medley to win in a new Olympic record time of 4 minutes, 02.95 seconds, just shy of his world mark of 4 minutes, 02.50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marchand was ahead as soon as his head popped from the water and he steadily pulled away from the field in what was essentially two separate races: Marchand racing the clock and everyone else competing for silver and bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The silver went to Japan's Tomoyuki Matsushita, who finished nearly 6 seconds behind the winner in 4 minutes, 08.62 seconds. American Carson Foster claimed the bronze a fraction of a second behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was crazy. I think I will remember this one for a very long time," said Marchand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The emotions are very difficult to describe. It was incredible for a swimmer. I opened my eyes, listened to everything that was happening around. And that really pushed me to already have a great race and have a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, it was a US one-two in the women's 100 metres butterfly as Torri Huske stunned her American teammate and world-record holder Gretchen Walsh to clinch the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walsh turned first, but Huske came home strongly to touch in 55.59 seconds, with Walsh second in 55.63 and China's Zhang Yufei taking bronze in 56.21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't really remember my race that much. My first 50 felt good, and then I've been really working on my second 50 a lot, especially after last year," said Huske.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian defending champion Maggie Mac Neil finished fifth and Australia's Emma McKeon, the queen of the pool in Tokyo with seven medals, came sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In semi-final action, China's Tang Qianting is ranked fourth going into the women's 100m breaststroke final later on Monday while Yang Junxuan is fifth seed going into the women's 200 free. On the men's side, Xu Jiayu qualified first in the 100m backstroke. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's badminton pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have staved off elimination from the Paris Olympics, after beating their American counterparts in a grueling match in the early hours of Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR shuttlers recovered a day after losing their opener against a pair from Bulgaria, to beat US twins Kerry and Annie Xu 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by eight points at one point, the SAR duo went on a 12-4 run to close the first game 24-22, saving four game points in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xus fought one back, 21-17, taking advantage of the Hong Kong pair's mistakes in quick succession towards the end of the second game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As fatigue appeared to affect the Americans more, the Hong Kong shuttlers won the decider, 21-11, for their first point of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Yeungs will battle Team China's Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the SAR loses, the pair will need the Americans to beat the Bulgarian sisters, Gabriela and Stefani Stoeva, by a wide margin for them to have a chance to advance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's dominance of Olympic skateboarding continued in Paris on Sunday as World No.1 Coco Yoshizawa won the women's street competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her compatriot, and the second highest ranked in the competition, Liz Akama, took silver while Brazil's Rayssa Leal overcame a poor start to the competition to win the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Cui Chenxi finished just outside the medals in fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen-year-old Yoshizawa held her arms out wide after sliding down the rail in the highest-scoring attempt of the best-trick stage of the competition, as an enthusiastic crowd at the La Concorde venue cheered wildly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Akama, who had a slim lead heading into the best trick portion of the competition, nailed a sublime 270 switch front board on her opening trick but could not improve on that effort. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting are one win away from a medal at the Paris Olympics, after advancing to the mixed doubles semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They defeated Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao of Spain 4-2 in the quarter-finals on Sunday at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair dropped the first game 9-11, but they won the next two games 11-9 and 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth game saw a suspenseful back and forth with the Spanish team securing that game 12-10, but Doo and Wong fought back in the next game winning 11-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team ultimately took the win 11-8 in the last game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the final four is Hong Kong's best result in this event and Wong said they were glad to have made the breakthrough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I'm just excited like everyone else is. Because at the previous games we went out in the last eight, and now we've made a breakthrough to enter the semifinals," he told reporters post-game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very difficult match. We've lost to them before. This time we gained our revenge. Ah Doo performed very well on the table. I trusted her 120 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Doo, it was the perfect tonic after losing her first-round singles match earlier in the day to North Korea's Pyon Song-gyong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo will square off against the North Korean team again in the semis on Monday when she and Wong face Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong at 10pm Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Koreans had defeated the world number two pair of Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan in an earlier round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong skiff sailors found themselves in second to last place after completing the first day of their Paris Olympics races on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth ranked 19th out of 20 teams in the event after three races in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They started off with 17 points in the first race, and improved to 12 points in the second. The final event of the day didn't turn out as well, as the pair finished with 19 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sailors with the fewest points win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China's pair of Wen Zaiding and Liu Tian are tenth after race day one, while New Zealanders Isaac McHardie and William McKenzie have taken the top spot so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The medal rounds are due to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the windsurfing competitions were postponed for the day due to a lack of wind. Hong Kong's Alex Cheng and Mui Ma are in the men's and women's events, respectively.

<div class="itemFullText">
 George Russell won the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa on Sunday holding off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton in a stunning Mercedes 1-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri came home in third with pole-sitter Charles Leclerc of Ferrari in fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started in 11th, finished fifth, extending his championship lead over the second McLaren of Lando Norris who finished one place further back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell began the race in sixth place and hit the front after opting for a one-stop pit strategy which saw him nursing his second set of tyres for 34 of the race's 44 laps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We definitely didn't predict this win in our strategy meeting this morning," said Russell for whom this was a third grand prix win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One-two for the team was awesome and what a way to go to the break."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen leads the championship race with 275 points, 78 clear of Norris. Red Bull lead the constructors' championship 42 points ahead of McLaren.
  <br/>

  Formula One now heads into a summer break with the next race in Zandvoort for the Dutch GP on August 25. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans booed a Dutch beach volleyball player convicted of raping an underage girl as he played his first match at the Paris Olympics, where his controversial selection has put the sport in the spotlight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven van de Velde, now 29, was convicted in 2016 of raping an underage girl and sentenced to four years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He walked onto centre court Sunday with teammate Matthew Immers on Sunday morning to cheers and applause, with many orange-clad Dutch fans standing to clap the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he was introduced individually over the loudspeaker, however, there was a loud chorus of boos from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also sporadic boos as he served throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player has won the backing of his country's national Olympic committee, and exchanged a warm hug with teammate Immers before the start of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his selection has drawn outrage among women's and sports safety groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the player would be separated from his teammates, not stay in the athletes' village, and forbidden from speaking to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His teammate Immers told reporters after the match that they had been "disappointed" by all the focus on van de Velde's past conviction, particularly after a "hard fight" to qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know the guy for two, three years together and we played every tournament," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me that's a big example that you grew, you learned a lot from it. What happened in the past... it's not good of course. But right now we are trying to enjoy and go to the next round," Immers added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ju'Riese Colon, chief executive of the US-based Center for SafeSport, said she was "deeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate" in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With teams from around the world convening in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety," she said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The maiden Olympic journeys of two SAR fencers, Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho, came to an end on Sunday, but both earned praise from their coaches for their strong performances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nineteen-year-old Chan bowed out of the women's foil individual event after she was beaten 15-8 by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16 at the Grand Palais in Paris. It's still the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong competitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sauer seized a 5-4 advantage after a back-and-forth first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world No 6 from Germany continued to impress in the second round, extending the lead to 10-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was too big a deficit for Chan, ranked 31st in the world, to overcome, but she said after the match that making it this far is already a huge accomplishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy I could reach top 16 and I think I enjoyed the stage so much, the atmosphere was amazing, and I'm very happy that I completed my first Olympics in a really good way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her coach Gregory Koenig applauded the teenage fencer for her performance, adding that Chan has the capability to compete at the highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know people can be disappointed because she doesn't bring a medal to Hong Kong. But we have to be honest, she fenced very well. She showed us she has the ability to have an amazing mindset for this kind of event, at 19 years old, her first Olympic Games," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Psychologically, she can be a great champion. Now she still has to work on the technical skills, the tactical skills, all the physical part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When all these are perfectly set out, if she can keep this mindset, she can really be in the top of the world and bring a medal in the next Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan had edged out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Hong Kong Olympic debutant, Cedric Ho, lost to Masaru Yamada of Japan 15-9 in the men's épée.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho was off to a quick start in their round of 32 match, racing to a 5-2 lead at the end of the first period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamada rallied in the next period, tying the score at 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer faltered in the third and final period which his Japanese opponent won 7-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all the times I have competed against him, I have never had a lead of more than five points. After the draw, I knew he was difficult to beat, but I wanted to try my best," Ho said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a big lead before I was overtaken, which I regret."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said Ho gave an exceptional performance despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that he was himself. That's the most important thing," he said. "The only regret is he didn't believe enough. My old coach used to say these are the moments you are more afraid of winning than losing."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pauline Ferrand-Prevot delivered France's second gold medal of the Paris Olympics as she took a high-quality field apart to win the women's cross-country mountain bike race on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old produced a devastating acceleration at the start of the second of seven laps around the dusty 4.4 kilometre circuit on Elancourt Hill and rode solo to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haley Batten of the US and Jenny Rissveds of Sweden were involved in a fierce scrap for silver with Batten bursting clear to finish runner-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Young Dutchwoman Puck Pieterse was the only rider who looked capable of making it a race and was alone in second place when she suffered a puncture on lap five and needed a wheel change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrand-Prevot, who will return to road racing after the Olympics, is a five-times cross-country world champion but suffered heartbreak at the last two Olympics when favourite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, in front of thousands of flag-waving French fans in the countryside near Versailles she reigned supreme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe it, I've worked so hard for this day that I was like a robot today," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so huge that I don't know what to say. In the final lap it was easier to enjoy it." (Reuters)

 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday booked a place in the women's 200m freestyle semifinals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey came second in her heat, 0.10 secs behind China's Li Bingjie.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem was on Sunday eliminated in the first round of the women's singles at the Paris Olympics, losing 4-1 to North Korea's Pyon Song Gyong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time SAR Olympian started off the round of 64 match losing two straight games 8-11 and 7-11, before fighting back and winning the third 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the North Korean won two more games 11-7 and 11-4 and sent Doo packing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Doo, who won bronze as part of the SAR's women's team at the Tokyo Games, will play in the mixed doubles quarter-finals with teammate Wong Chun-ting later on Sunday. They will take on the Spanish duo of Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao for a spot in the semi-finals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Sunday advanced to the quarterfinals of the men's single sculls at the Paris Olympics after finishing second in his repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu finished two seconds behind Sid Ali Boudina of Algeria, clocking 7 minutes and 12.94 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR rower was in second place through the first 500 metres, but dropped to third for the next kilometre. He picked up the pace in the final stretch and overtook Bermuda's Dara Alizadeh for second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have earned the respect of many competitors, because they thought Hong Kong's rowing team might not be able to perform well and be competitive in open events. But I showed them that I was capable to reach the quarterfinals," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had finished out of the running in Saturday's heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterfinals are set to be held on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China shaded Japan in men's artistic gymnastics qualifying at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with all-around leader Zhang Boheng hailing his team's spirit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a frenetic first day's action at Bercy Arena, a boisterous crowd was treated to a taste of the thrills and spills ahead, with American superstar Simone Biles making her eagerly awaited entrance on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian Olympic Committee won the men's team title at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games but Russian gymnasts are not defending their title, leaving China as favourites to take gold for the first time since London 2012 on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Led by Olympic debutant Zhang, China topped the team qualifying standings by 2.434 points from Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain, featuring world vault champion Jake Jarman and double Olympic pommel horse gold medallist Max Whitlock, were third ahead of Ukraine and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang topped the individual all-around table from Japan's Shinnosuke Oka and defending champion Daiki Hashimoto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy with that, it's my highest score in a major competition this year" said Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our team performed excellently. Everyone did very well and showed great team spirit." (AFP)

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Meanwhile in the swimming pool, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia began their Olympic swim campaign with two golds while the United States stamped their authority in the men's 4x100 metres freestyle relay to win in a time of 3 minutes, 9.28 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia took silver and Italy won bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's relay capped an exciting night of Olympic swimming at La Defense Arena, which began when Germany's Lukas Maertens surged to victory in the men's 400 metres freestyle gold medal, narrowly missing the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old was under world record pace for 350 metres before fading in the final stretch to touch in 3 minutes, 41.78 seconds ahead of Australia's Elijah Winnington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korean 2024 world champion Kim Woo-min took bronze in 3 minutes, 42.50 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maertens was overcome with emotion after his win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Means everything to me -- you can see my progress in performance... I am extremely happy and just overwhelmed," said Maertens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't put into words what I am feeling now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's 400 metres freestyle final wasn't as fast as expected but it saw defending champion and world record holder Ariarne Titmus stamp her dominance from the get go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian led from start to finish to win in 3 minutes 57.49 seconds, holding off the challenge from Canada's Summer McIntosh who took silver while US star Katie Ledecky grabbed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just happy to get the result for myself and I feel so honoured to be a part of the race and be alongside legends like Katie," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look up to her so much as an athlete and there's certainly not a rivalry beyond the races. I really respect her as a person and I hope that I put on a good show tonight and everyone enjoyed it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia also claimed their fourth consecutive gold in the women's 400 freestyle relay in an Olympic record time of 3 minutes, 28.92 seconds as the Dolphins out fought their American rivals who took silver in an Americas record time while China won bronze with a new Asian mark. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing queen Vivian Kong on Sunday won the women's epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics in the most dramatic fashion, defeating local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in a fence-off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Frenchwoman, ranked sixth in the world, started off strong, taking a 7-1 lead in the second round after taking the first 4-0, to the delight of the home crowd, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at the Grand Palais.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With momentum fully on Mallo-Breton's side, world number one Kong changed sword in an apparent attempt to regroup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China athlete then fenced on a 9-3 run to tie the score at 10-10 in the middle of the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencers took the score to 12-12 for the one-minute fence off, and Kong struck first to take home the SAR's first gold medal at this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what went through her mind when she clawed back from the big deficit, Kong said she didn't want to "lose ugly" and not be able to fence with "the Hong Kong spirit".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also thanked people in Hong Kong for showing support. "Thank you for staying up and watching, and I know, I'm so grateful," Kong told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really thankful, I'm really grateful, I'm just so lucky because every [fencer] deserves it, in fencing anything can happen, I love all the girls here, I just can't believe it's me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tearful Kong also said that in the past, she was afraid of losing and got more nervous. But she now believed that, as she's worked to the best of her abilities and everyone around her has done their best to support her, she no longer had to sweat herself out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong fencer's coach for the past nine years, Octavian Zidaru, said he thinks Kong has made amazing progress and overcame lots of injuries to reach the top of the Olympic podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Kong now has many moves and tactics at her disposal, and in the past month he's tried to just calm her nerves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last month, I tried not to put any pressure on her, even in Hong Kong," Zidaru told reporters. "I told her, 'we participate in this Olympic Games like in any other competition.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's only the third Hong Kong gold in history and follows fellow fencer Edgar Cheung's foil victory in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee sent his congratulations, while the sports minister, Kevin Yeung, said after watching the final in Paris that he was "touched and delighted by her performance and demeanour of a great athlete".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as Macron, spectators who saw Kong's triumph included US First Lady Jill Biden and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France won an historic first gold medal in men's Olympic Rugby Sevens, beating two-time defending champions and rugby sevens' powerhouses Fiji 28-7 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was also the first gold medal of the Games for the host nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tied at 7-7 going into the break, the French dominated the Fijians much to the delight of the home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Dupont scored two tries and set up another to inspire France to the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result is a remarkable comeback for the French who failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Africa beat Australia 26-19 in a closely-fought bronze-medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Aussies took a 7-5 lead at the break, but the Springbok Sevens took control of the match in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two quick tries by Zain Davids, both converted by Tristan Leyds, coupled with a red card to Australia's Nick Malouf for a dangerous tackle on Tiaan Pretorius, put South Africa in control at 19-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Aussies scored two late tries, one of which was converted, to pull level on the scoreboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the last restart, with seconds left on the clock, the Springboks created space on the left with Selvyn Davids racing away before giving the ball to Shaun Williams to score the match - and medal - winner. (Agencies)

 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix on pole position with Red Bull's Sergio Perez next to him on the front row.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World champion Max Verstappen was 0.595 seconds quicker than Leclerc in a wet qualifying session on Saturday but the Red Bull driver starts in 11th place because of a 10-place grid penalty for taking a new engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I definitely did not expect that this weekend but with the tricky conditions we could do something above our expectations," said Leclerc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a good day for the team and now we need to focus on tomorrow and see what will happen when the rain is gone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's teammate Perez, who was just 0.011sec behind Leclerc, will join the Monegasque on the front row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton starts from third in his Mercedes, followed by the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who locked out an impressive 1-2 in the last race in Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mercedes' George Russell was seventh fastest ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and the Alpine of Esteban Ocon. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong will be the first Hong Kong, China medallist of the 2024 Paris Olympics after a dramatic semi-final victory in the women's epee in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one defeated Estonia's Nelli Differt 15-11 in a nail-biting semi-final that saw the lead change hands frequently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first period started with a tight back and forth tussle that resulted in a two-all tie. That intensity continued into the second period, as the two players went neck to neck but Kong was able to move herself up on the scoreboard 8-7 by the end of that spell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong successfully widened the gap in the final round, adding seven points to pull herself into the gold medal bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencing queen is the second person from the SAR to win a fencing medal after Tokyo champion Edgar Cheung, and the first in the epee discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gold or silver will be Hong Kong first ever medal in women's fencing. She'll face local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in the final at 3.30am, Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA deducted six points from Canada in the Paris Olympics women’s football tournament and banned three coaches for one year each on Saturday in a drone spying scandal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The stunning swath of punishments include a US$226,000 fine for the Canadian soccer federation in a case that has spiraled at the Summer Games. Two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand’s practices before their opening game last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Bev Priestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, already was suspended by the national soccer federation then removed from the Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priestman and her two assistants implicated in the case, Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander, are now banned from all soccer for one year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA fast-tracked its own disciplinary process by asking its appeals judges to handle the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA judges found Priestman and her two assistants “were each found responsible for offensive behavior and violation of the principles of fair play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Canadian federation was held responsible for not ensuring its staff complied with tournament rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coaches and the Canadian federation now can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport's special Olympic court in Paris. That tribunal is set up for urgent hearings and verdicts at the Olympics. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid unveiled Brazilian teenager Endrick, who has joined the European champions on a six-year deal, in an event at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Endrick, who turned 18 last week, arrives from the Brazilian club Palmeiras, where he won two league titles and a Super Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his international debut aged 17 against Colombia last November, going on to score his first goal against England in a 1-0 win in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was a member of Brazil's Copa America squad, making his first international start in the quarter-final with Uruguay which they lost on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't have words to describe what I'm feeling because I've always wanted to be here," Endrick said during his presentation at the Bernabeu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wanted to play for Madrid, it's like a dream coming true today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid begin the defence of their La Liga title when they face Mallorca on August 18. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting advanced to the last eight in the mixed doubles event, defeating their Hungarian opponents 4-1 in their opening match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo jumped out to a 2-0 lead, before Dora Madarasz and Nandor Ecseki clawed a game back 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hungarians lost the fourth game 11-6 as the SAR duo stormed their way to take the final game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our belief never wavered. We hope we can play every point well. And in the end, we managed to do that," Wong told reporters in the post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair will face Maria Xiao and Alvaro Robles from Spain in the quarter-finals on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong gymnast Stone Shek was unable to make it to the final round in vault, finishing 12th in the qualifying round with eight athletes making the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He miscued his first jump after landing on his feet and needed to use his hands to regain his balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shek, who was making his third Olympic appearance after London and Tokyo, ended up with a score of 14.099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite not advancing further, the gymnast, 32, said Paris was a very good experience which he found to be the most enjoyable and pressure free in his 20 odd years in the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because vault after all is a little bit like gambling. No matter how good you do during practice, when you can't make the move during the competition, you can't," Shek told reporters.

 Hong Kong's world number one fencer, Vivian Kong, is another step closer to reaching the Olympic podium, after sweeping Ukraine's Olena Kryvytska in the quarter-finals of the women's individual epee on Saturday at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong started the first round with a strong 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian was able to come back with four points, but the SAR fencing star fought back hard to finish the second period 9-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong then eased her way into the final four with six additional points in the final round to win 15-7, making this bout her best performance so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competition now moves onto the podium piste for the beginning of the semi-finals, where Kong will take on Nelli Differt, the 12th-ranked fencer from Estonia, in the semi-final at 1am Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eszter Muhari of Hungary or France's Auriane Mello-Breton await in the final later.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian Grace Brown destroyed the field to claim her country's first gold medal of the Games in the women's individual time trial, her power and bike handling abilities being unmatched by her rivals on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Several riders slid and fell on wet and cobbled corners on the 32.4-kilometre course, with defending champion Chloe Dygert ending up being the biggest casualty and having to settle for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Anna Henderson took third place, one minute 31.59 seconds behind Brown's winning time of 39 minutes 38.24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dygert hit the deck on a corner in the Bois de Vincennes, which effectively ended her chances of retaining her title and cost her second place as she ended 0.87 seconds behind Henderson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it was a good day for Belgium in the men's individual time trial as Remco Evenepoel won the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel added the Olympic gold to his world title on Saturday, defying rain and a strong field to win on the 32.4 kilometre course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old was almost 15 seconds faster than Italian Filippo Ganna in second while Evenepoel's compatriot, Wout van Aert, took bronze. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Puddles at the skateboarding arena as Saturday's events were delayed because of rain. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763452_1_20240727215944.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pouring rain in Paris on Saturday forced the men's Olympics street skateboarding competition to be postponed and tennis matches were also delayed, while athletes had mixed feelings about how to cope with the unexpectedly wet weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, a dazzling but soaked opening ceremony for the Summer Games saw thousands of athletes parade on a flotilla of barges on the Seine, at the heart of the French capital, waving to the crowd despite the downpour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese badminton player He Bingjiao laughed when she was asked if she thought the opening ceremony had been beautiful, saying she did not make it because of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately I couldn't attend because of the rain. I had to rest," she said. "It's not normal to have had a ceremony like this on the boats. I was watching it on my phone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rain continued on Saturday, forcing some events to be rescheduled and umbrellas were more in evidence than sunglasses at the beach volleyball at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The risk factor becomes too high when skateboarding in the rain," a spokesperson for World Skate said after Saturday's competition was rescheduled to Monday because La Concorde, the outdoor venue where it was supposed to take place, was drenched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening day of the tennis event was also disrupted, with thousands of spectators without tickets for the two main show courts left frustrated after negotiating lengthy queues to get in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Play began on time under the Court Philippe Chatrier roof and across the complex on Court Suzanne Lenglen. But play on the uncovered courts was delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Paris 2024 organisers said they were confident the triathlon events would take place as scheduled on Tuesday even though the rain might lead to Sunday's training session being cancelled due to concerns over the water quality in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes themselves were not that bothered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm from Oslo, so this is a perfect Norwegian summer," Inger Seim Kavlie, Norway women's double sculls rower, said with a grin as the rained poured down in the mixed zone, close to the finish line. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton stars Tse Ying-suet and Jordan Tang made a triumphant start to the Paris Olympics on Saturday, defeating their counterparts from Chinese Taipei 2-0 in their mixed doubles opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair from the SAR beat Lee Chia-hsin and Ye Hong-wei 21-13, 21-13 in their Group C game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse and Tang will next play Japan's pair of Arisa Higashino and Yuta Watanabe, whom they lost to in the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three duos are fighting for two spots in the knockout stages. A Danish pair who would've also competed in the group withdrew from the Games earlier this month after one of them had issues reporting his whereabouts in line with anti-doping regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on the badminton courts, Hong Kong's women's double pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Nga-lam suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Bulgaria's Gabriela Stoeva and Stefani Stoeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bulgarians won 21-11, 21-23 and 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong pair are next in action against the Americans Annie Xu and Kerry Xu on Monday.

 Fencing queen Vivian Kong on Saturday advanced to the quarterfinals of the women's epee individual event, after defeating the United States’ Hadley Husisian 15-12 in the group of 16 match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one ended the first round with a strong 3-1 lead. Kong then widened the gap further in the second period earning five points to bring the score to 8-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two then were locked in a back and forth contest at the start of the final round, but Kong ultimately advanced to the last eight by bringing in three more points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong had reached the quarterfinals during the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763439_1_20240727195849.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Olympic Committee apologised on Saturday for a gaffe during the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics in which South Korean athletes were incorrectly introduced as North Korean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the South Korean delegation sailed down the Seine river in the French capital, they were introduced with the official name for North Korea: "Republique populaire democratique de Coree" in French, then "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" in English.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We deeply apologise for the mistake that occurred when introducing the South Korean team during the broadcast of the opening ceremony," the IOC said in a post on its official Korean-language X account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The error sparked displeased reactions in South Korea, that is technically still at war with the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Korean Sport & Olympic Committee said later on Saturday that it had received a message from the IOC indicating that its chief, Thomas Bach, wished to directly apologise to the president of South Korea over the phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Korea's sports ministry said in a statement it "expresses regret" over the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second vice sports minister Jang Mi-ran, a 2008 Olympic weightlifting champion, has asked for a meeting with IOC chief Bach to discuss the matter, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's foreign ministry said in a statement it had contacted the French embassy in Seoul which expressed regret over what it said was an "incomprehensible mistake".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea was correctly introduced with the country's official name. (AFP)

    Ledecky edges Titmus in Olympic 400m free heats

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Australia's Ariarne Titmus (L) and US' Katie Ledecky (C) compete. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763438_1_20240727193222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American great Katie Ledecky edged defending champion Ariarne Titmus to be quickest into the Olympic 400m freestyle final on Saturday, setting the scene for a titanic battle for gold.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The veteran, who was stunned by the Australian in Tokyo three years ago, touched in 4 minutes 02.19 seconds at a packed La Defense Arena ahead of an evening final on day one of the nine-day meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Racing in the same heat, Titmus went out hard and led through 300m before Ledecky came storming home to win by a fingertip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus hit the wall in 4:02.46, well outside her 3:55.38 world record as both swimmers conserved energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand rising star and current world champion Erika Fairweather was third quickest in 4:02.55, a fraction clear of Canadian Summer McIntosh, who snatched the world record last year before Titmus took it back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good to walk out to a full stadium for our prelims race," said Ledecky, who will also swim the 800m and 1500m in Paris but has dropped the 200m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It felt very similar to our Olympic trials a few weeks back, so I'm excited to see the finals atmosphere tonight as well and just happy to get a good first one under the belt."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus said the race helped "blow the cobwebs out" and denied coming second gave Ledecky any psychological advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think so. It's a heats swim," said the Australian, who broke the 200m freestyle world record and swam the second quickest 400m ever at the Australian trials last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only job for me was to get in the middle lanes [for the final] and I tried to conserve as much as I could." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong judoka Wong Ka-lee on Saturday bowed out from the Olympics, losing 10-0 to Austrian Katharina Tanzer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong was eliminated in the women’s 48-kilogramme competition by Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she was disappointed with her performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could have performed better, because I thought I had a chance after the draw. I hope I could do better next time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank [my coach and my younger brother] for encouraging me all the time... I was very nervous before the match, but they tried to help me relax."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was competing in the Games for the first time and marked the return of a Hong Kong judoka in the Olympics after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team remained in last place for most of the race, before overcoming Ireland to claim seventh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au – who's taking part in her fifth Olympics – said the team had put in "100 percent of hard work" to prepare for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On competing in the future, the swimmer said: "I just wanted to swim well this time, simply focus on doing well in the competition, and think about the rest later."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's shooters on Saturday claimed the first gold at the Paris Olympics, with a victory in the 10-metre air rifle mixed team event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventeen-year-old Huang Yuting and 19-year-old Sheng Lihao clinched their victory over South Koreans Keum Jihyeon and Park Hajun, outscoring their opponents 16-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair had earlier topped the qualifying round with a score of 632.2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had fielded two pairs to compete in the mixed team event, including Han Jiayu and Du Linshu, who placed eighth in the qualifying round.

  Kazakhstan, meanwhile, won the first bronze medal in the same event after beating Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, divers Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen won the women's synchronised three-metre springboard event, kicking off China's bid to take home all eight diving gold medals at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Olympians Chang and Chen outshone their opponents in each of the five rounds, finishing with an overall score of 337.68.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Saturday narrowly missed out on qualifying for the next round at the Paris Olympics, but moves on to the repechage for another chance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-time Olympian finished second-last in his men's single sculls heat, clocking a time of 7:00.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said he was satisfied with his performance, which he described as "above-average".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finishing in seven minutes is a rather good time. I had the fastest time [going into the repechage] out of all six heats, so I hope I could perform like this again in the repechage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it's a pity that I was so close yet so far, and missed the quarter-finals by one spot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who is the first SAR athlete to compete in the Paris Games, will next compete in Sunday's repechage.
