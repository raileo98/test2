<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 33 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter, and the Dallas Mavericks outlasted the Minnesota Timberwolves for a 108-105 win in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals on Wednesday night in Minneapolis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyrie Irving added 30 points on 12-for-23 shooting for Dallas. Daniel Gafford [10 points, nine rebounds] and Dereck Lively II [nine points, 11 rebounds] narrowly missed double-doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 24 points and made 6 of 9 attempts from beyond the arc to lead the Timberwolves. Anthony Edwards finished with 19 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks outscored Minnesota 26-22 in the fourth quarter to help secure the three-point win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas went on a 13-0 run to seize a 97-89 lead with 7:38 to go. Doncic started the run with seven straight points and he finished it with a pair of free throws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota responded with a 10-1 run to grab a 99-98 edge with 4:39 left. Towns hit a 3-pointer from 28 feet to put the Timberwolves on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a timeout, Edwards made a 3-pointer to increase Minnesota's lead to 102-98 with 3:37 to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks answered with back-to-back 3-pointers by Doncic and P.J. Washington to go ahead 104-102 with 1:56 left. Doncic followed with a step-back jump shot to make it 106-102 with 49.2 seconds to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas maintained the lead the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves clung to an 83-82 advantage at the end of the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gafford threw down a pair of alley-oop dunks to start the second-half scoring for the Mavericks. Derrick Jones Jr. followed a couple minutes later with a dunk that put Dallas on top 67-66 for its first lead since the opening quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota led 62-59 at halftime. McDaniels had 19 points before the break, which marked a playoff career high for him in any half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves led by eight in the final minute of the first half, but Irving scored five points in the last 22 seconds to pull Dallas within three. He finished the scoring by converting a three-point play on a basket and a free throw with 0.7 seconds left. (Reuters)

    Atalanta halt Leverkusen to win Europa League

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Atalanta's Berat Djimsiti lifts the trophy with teammates. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754320_1_20240523080746.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ademola Lookman scored a stunning hat-trick as Atalanta beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 in the Europa League final on Wednesday to win just the second major trophy in their 117-year history and end the German champions' remarkable unbeaten streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lookman, who struggled to establish himself in the English Premier League with Everton, Fulham and Leicester City before reviving his career in Italy under Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini, struck twice inside the first 26 minutes before sealing the win 15 minutes from fulltime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory ended Gasperini's own two-decade long pursuit of major silverware as his side totally outplayed Xabi Alonso's formidable Leverkusen side - or 'Neverlusen' as they had been dubbed after going an incredible 51 games unbeaten.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just as they did against Premier League heavyweights Liverpool and three-times finalists Olympique de Marseille in the previous two rounds, Atalanta didn't give their opponents a sniff to mark their first European final with a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen started the game looking decidedly unsure of themselves and some uncharacteristically sloppy play handed the first chance of the game to Gianluca Scamacca, who didn't get enough on his header from a fine Matteo Ruggeri cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an early warning shot and the purposeful Italians struck within minutes when Davide Zappacosta was allowed far too much space down the right before Lookman beat a flatfooted Exequiel Palacios to the cut back to stroke home the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lookman was mobbed by his team mates and substitutes who were in dreamland 14 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Leverkusen error gifted possession to the Nigeria forward, who skipped past one defender and curled a beautiful right-footed shot into the bottom-right corner from just outside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stunned Germans showed brief flashes of how quickly they can turn it on in attack but little came of it and it was Charles De Ketelaere who came closest on the break as Atalanta did not show a shred of debut final nerves nor any effects from the absence of injured captain Marten de Roon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen swapped defender Josip Stanisic for top scorer Victor Boniface at halftime but it changed little as both sets of travelling fans continued to create the kind of Aviva Stadium noise matched only by some of the Irish rugby teams' famous wins or memorable international soccer nights of years gone by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen had only failed to score once during the run that featured 42 wins in all competitions and 17 goals scored in or after the 90th minute, but the chances of another comeback faded away against the resolute Atalanta backline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lookman completely extinguished them on the counterattack with another stunning strike into the top corner, this time with his left foot to complete his hat-trick, the sixth in a major European final and first since Jupp Heynckes' for Borussia Moenchengladbach in the 1975 UEFA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was flung into the air by his team mates 15 minutes later when the final whistle blew and the Bergamo club ended the 61-year wait since their 1963 Italian Cup triumph. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic celebrated his 37th birthday on Wednesday with a much-needed win as he gears up for his French Open title defence, progressing to the Geneva quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one downed Germany's Yannick Hanfmann 6-3, 6-3 in the second round at the Parc des Eaux-Vives grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic took a wild card to play in Geneva in a bid to rescue an alarming dip in form ahead of next week's French Open, the second Grand Slam of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd sang "Happy Birthday" to Djokovic as a cake with candles was brought out onto the court following his win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lifted the cake and showed it off to the crowd, having a nibble before offering some to the ball boys and girls. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Olympic swimming champion David Wilkie has died at the age of 70, his family said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wilkie, who won 200 metres breaststroke gold for Great Britain at the 1976 Games in Montreal, died on Wednesday after suffering from cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great sadness that the family of David Wilkie MBE announce that he died peacefully surrounded by his family this morning, following his brave battle with cancer," his family said in a statement released to Britain's Press Association news agency:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wilkie also won two Olympic silver medals and three world titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1954 to Scottish parents, Wilkie won his first major medal with a bronze at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, representing Scotland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first World Championship gold followed in 1973 in Belgrade, and two years later he won both 100m and 200m breaststroke titles in Cali, Colombia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his finest performance came at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal where Wilkie, who had been training and studying at the University of Miami, broke the US dominance of Olympic swimming by winning 200m breaststroke gold with an outstanding swim, breaking the existing world record by over three seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the only non-American to win a gold in the men's swimming events in Montreal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wilkie retired from competitive swimming soon after the Games, at the age of 22, and subsequently became a successful businessman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is survived by his wife, Helen, and children Natasha and Adam. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Renowned Sherpa mountain guide Kami Rita scaled Mount Everest for a record 30th time on Wednesday, completing his second climb this month to the top of the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rita reached the 8,849-metre summit at 7:49am local time, according to Khim Lal Gautam, a Nepalese government official at Everest base camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first ascent of this year's climbing season was on May 12 guiding foreign clients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also climbed Mount Everest twice last year, setting the record for the most climbs of the world's highest mountain on the first and extending it less than a week later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His closest competitor for the most climbs of Mount Everest is fellow Sherpa guide Pasang Dawa, who has 27 successful ascents of the mountain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rita first climbed Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum scored 36 points, including 10 in overtime after Jaylen Brown's tying 3-pointer with 6.1 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Boston Celtics rallied just in time for a 133-128 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jrue Holiday added a season-high 28 points and Brown finished with 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists for the Pacers, who knocked down 13 3-pointers and scored 56 points in the paint against a Celtics team still playing without 7-footer Kristaps Porzingis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Siakam added 24 points and 12 rebounds. Myles Turner finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds for the sixth-seeded Pacers, who twice turned it over with a three-point lead in the final 30 seconds of regulation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown made them pay for the second one, hitting a 3 from the corner with Siakam right in his face to tie it at 117.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana went back ahead 123-121 when Haliburton hit all three free throws after being fouled with 1:46 remaining. Tatum then muscled in a layup and was fouled by T.J. McConnell. He completed the three-point play to put Boston ahead for good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers turned it over again, this time by Haliburton. The ball found its way to Tatum at the top of key. He pumped, sidestepped a defender and sunk a 3 to make it 127-123 with 43 seconds left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Derrick White and Siakam traded layups. Holiday was fouled and hit two free throws to give Boston a 131-125 cushion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game 2 is Thursday night in Boston. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time champions Kolkata Knight Riders pummelled Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets in the qualifier to waltz into the final of the Indian Premier League [IPL] on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mitchell Starc produced a three-wicket burst to rattle Hyderabad, who managed a below-par 159 before they were all out with three balls left in their innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kolkata romped home with 6.2 overs to spare after unbeaten half-centuries by Venkatesh Iyer [51] and skipper Shreyas Iyer [58].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hyderabad will get another chance to make Sunday's final when they clash with the winners of Wednesday's eliminator between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Starc entered the league as its most expensive player following his US$2.98 million deal with Kolkata, but he struggled for wickets in the first half of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-arm seamer was bang on the money on Tuesday though as he removed compatriot Travis Head for a duck and sent back Nitish Kumar Reddy and Shahbaz Ahmed in successive deliveries to rock Hyderabad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahul Tripathi [55], Heinrich Klaasen [32] and skipper Pat Cummins [30] took Hyderabad past the 150-mark but it was not enough to test Kolkata's formidable batting lineup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Sunil Narine gave Kolkata a flying start before Venkatesh and Shreyas plundered 97 runs off 44 balls to seal an easy victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rajasthan Royals will take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the eliminator at the same venue on Wednesday. (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754125_1_20240522023745.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mauricio Pochettino has left his job as Chelsea manager by mutual consent after one season in charge, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "On behalf of everyone at Chelsea, we would like to express our gratitude to Mauricio for his service this season," sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will be welcome back to Stamford Bridge any time and we wish him all the very best in his future coaching career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino joined Chelsea ahead of the 2023-24 season when he replaced interim manager Frank Lampard as the club's new owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital looked to freshen things up at Stamford Bridge after finishing 12th in the previous campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Chelsea started the season poorly and found themselves in the bottom half of the standings despite spending more than any club in Europe, Pochettino managed to guide the London club to sixth in the Premier League standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speculation had been rife that the former Paris St Germain and Tottenham Hotspur boss would be gone after just one year in charge but Pochettino remained tight-lipped about his future when asked after their final game of the season on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to the Chelsea ownership group and sporting directors for the opportunity to be part of this football club's history," Pochettino said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club is now well positioned to keep moving forward in the Premier League and Europe in the years to come." (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eight goals in 42 appearances for his club this season has not been enough to earn Marcus Rashford an England place.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marcus Rashford paid for his poor season as the Manchester United forward was left out of England boss Gareth Southgate's provisional 33-man squad for Euro 2024 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson and Chelsea skipper Reece James were among the other big names to miss out on the squad, that must be trimmed to a maximum of 26 before the tournament in Germany begins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is rewarded for the Eagles' brilliant end to the Premier League season with his first-ever call up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite and Liverpool duo Jarell Quansah and Curtis Jones are the other uncapped players selected with Southgate short on defensive options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England face Bosnia and Herzegovina on June 3 and Iceland four days later before jetting off for Germany, where they are one of the favourites to win the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wealth of options available to Southgate in attacking areas means Rashford misses out on a major international tournament for the first time since the 2014 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rashford has scored just eight times in 42 appearances for his club this season and only recently returned from injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henderson's move to Ajax in January after a short spell in Saudi Arabia has not done enough to earn the 33-year-old a place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same goes for Jadon Sancho despite his renaissance on his return to Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund on loan from United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raheem Sterling and Kalvin Phillips were also overlooked despite shining for Southgate in the past at major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, who fired Manchester City to the Premier League title on Sunday, and Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka are included as part of a fearsome collection of creative talent to supply England's all-time top goalscorer Harry Kane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's men begin their quest to win a major tournament for the first time in 58 years against Serbia on June 16 before facing Denmark and Slovenia in Group C.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squad:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal), Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace), James Trafford (Burnley)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defenders: Kyle Walker, John Stones (both Manchester City), Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire (both Manchester United), Jarrad Branthwaite (Everton), Jarell Quansah, Joe Gomez (both Liverpool), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Kieran Trippier (Newcastle), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Lewis Dunk (Brighton)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Midfielders: Declan Rice (Arsenal), Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace), Conor Gallagher (Chelsea), Trent Alexander-Arnold, Curtis Jones (both Liverpool)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forwards: Harry Kane (Bayern Munich/GER), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa), Ivan Toney (Brentford), Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), James Maddison (Tottenham), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid/ESP), Phil Foden, Jack Grealish (both Manchester City), Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace) (AFP)

    Women's tennis signs partnership with Saudi's PIF

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Saudi Public Investment Fund [PIF] will become the first-ever naming partner of the WTA's rankings, the two organisations announced on Monday, as part of a multi-year partnership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement marks the PIF's latest foray into tennis, after the men's ATP tour also signed a multi-year "strategic partnership" earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we look forward to sharing the journey of our talented players across the season, as we continue to grow the sport, creating more fans of tennis and inspiring more young people to take up the game," WTA Ventures CEO Marina Storti said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement marks the latest move in a dramatic shift by the women's tour, which was previously reluctant to embrace Saudi partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outgoing CEO Steve Simon said last year that Saudi Arabia posed "big issues" as a host for women's tennis events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was announced in April that the season-ending WTA Finals will be held in the Saudi capital Riyadh from 2024-2026, with the Saudi Tennis Federation offering record prize money of US$15.25 million this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came despite pushback from retired greats Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, while Russian Daria Kasatkina, who came out as gay in 2022, also expressed reservations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's rights activists and members of the LGBTQ community accused the country of "sports-washing", criticising Saudi Arabia's human rights record as it pumps huge amounts of money into soccer, Formula One and the LIV Golf circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed AlSayyad, head of corporate brand at PIF, said the organisation would "continue to be a catalyst for the growth of women’s sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with the WTA to increase participation and inspire the next generation of talent," he said in a statement. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Feyenoord coach Arne Slot was on Monday confirmed as Jurgen Klopp's successor at Liverpool by the Premier League club.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club said in a statement that the Dutchman, 45, would take up the position of head coach on June 1, subject to a work permit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot's arrival has been an open secret, with Liverpool reportedly agreeing a compensation deal worth up to £9.4 million (US$12 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed Anfield was his next destination at his final pre-match press conference at the Eredivisie club on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp announced his departure in January and took charge of his final game on Sunday, a 2-0 win against Wolves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his final speech to the Anfield crowd, the German urged fans to throw their full support behind Slot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me," he said. "You go all-in from the first day. And you keep believing and you push the team." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Karl-Anthony Towns had 23 points and 11 rebounds and the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves overcame a 20-point, third-quarter deficit to beat the Denver Nuggets 98-90 in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals on Sunday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Minnesota advances to the Western Conference finals for the first time in 20 years after winning in Denver for the third time in the series. The Timberwolves won Game 7 against the Sacramento Kings in 2004 to reach the conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota, the No. 3 seed, hosts No. 5 Dallas in Game 1 on Wednesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 22 points and Anthony Edwards was 6-for-24 shooting but finished with 18 points, eight rebounds and seven assists to end the Nuggets' bid for a second straight NBA title. Rudy Gobert was big down the stretch, scoring eight of his 13 points in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nikola Jokic had 34 points and 19 rebounds and Jamal Murray scored 35 points for Denver. It is the second time in six seasons the Nuggets have lost a Game 7 at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota took its first lead since the first quarter on Rudy Gobert's floater early in the fourth quarter and stretched it 77-72. Jokic missed his first six 3-pointers but hit two from deep to keep the Nuggets close.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naz Reid, who scored 11 points, hit two free throws, blocked Jokic's floater and had a putback dunk. Edwards drained a 3-pointer off a Murray turnover to put the Timberwolves ahead 92-82 with 3:07 left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denver closed within 93-88 with 1:02 left but Towns tip-in sealed Minnesota's trip to the conference finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets staged a 16-0 run spanning the first and second quarters and led 53-38 at halftime. They pushed it to 58-38 early in the third and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a 17-footer that would have made it a 22-point lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves came storming back, using a 19-3 run to get within 61-57 with 3:05 left in the period. Towns hit a pair of free throws to get Minnesota within two, and Edwards drained a 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left to make it 67-66 heading into the fourth. (Reuters)

    Schauffele birdies final hole to win at Valhalla

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Schauffele holds The Wanamaker Trophy. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753839_1_20240520081110.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele birdied the final hole to win the PGA Championship by one shot over LIV Golf's Bryson DeChambeau at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday to claim his first major title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Schauffele put the finishing touches on a wire-to-wire victory at the year's second major with a closing six-under-par 65 that left him at 21 under on the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Needing a closing birdie for the win, Schauffele's tee shot at the 18th perched up on the edge of a fairway bunker and forced him to take a compromised stance inside the hazard for his second shot, which he left just in front of the green.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele then displayed nerves of steel as he chipped to six feet from where he drained the biggest birdie of his career for the lowest winning score to par at a major championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau carded a bogey-free seven-under-par 64 to finish two shots ahead of Viktor Hovland [66], whose spirited effort to become the first Norwegian to win a major came undone at the final hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A day that began with seven players within four strokes of overnight co-leaders Schauffele and Collin Morikawa turned into a thrilling three-horse race across the back nine at Valhalla between Schauffele, DeChambeau and Hovland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau and Hovland were playing in the third-to-last pairing and each set up pressure-packed 10-foot birdie putts on the final hole. DeChambeau drained his but Hovland's effort curled away and he went on to make bogey and finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left the outcome in the hands of Schauffele, who was on the par-four 17th where he did well to save par after his tee shot caught a fairway bunker before sealing the deal at the 18th while DeChambeau watched it unfold on a nearby screen. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tyrese Haliburton reacts during the Pacers' win against the Knicks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753838_1_20240520080620.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tyrese Haliburton scored 26 points for the visiting Indiana Pacers, who rode a historic shooting performance to a 130-109 win over the New York Knicks in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series Sunday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indiana shot 67.1 percent (53-of-79) from the field – the highest shooting percentage ever in an NBA playoff game. They broke the previous record held by the 1990 Boston Celtics, who shot 67 percent [63-of-94] in a 157-128 win over the Knicks in a first-round game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers, who overcame series deficits of 2-0 and 3-2, will face the Boston Celtics in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals, scheduled to begin Tuesday night. This is the first trip to the conference finals for Indiana since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks, who played short-handed throughout the series and lost star point guard Jalen Brunson to a fractured left hand in the third quarter Sunday, fell short in their bid to appear in the conference finals for the first time since 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrew Nembhard and Pascal Siakam each scored 20 points while Aaron Nesmith had 19 points on 8-of-8 shooting for the Pacers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myles Turner scored 17 points while T.J. McConnell added 12 points off the bench. The 130 points were the most by a road team in a Game 7 in NBA history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donte DiVincenzo scored 39 points for the Knicks, who played the series without All-Star Julius Randle [out since January with a right shoulder injury]. Mitchell Robinson didn't play after Game 1 due to an aggravation of his left ankle injury while OG Anunoby missed the previous four games with a left hamstring before scoring five points in fewer than five first-quarter minutes Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart played 36-plus minutes Sunday despite an abdominal injury he suffered in Game 6 Friday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alec Burks had 26 points Sunday while Brunson had 17 points and nine assists. Hart tallied 10 points, eight rebounds and five assists before fouling out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks scored the first seven points of the third quarter to begin a 12-3 run that pulled them within 73-67 with 8:06 left. But Indiana answered with a 22-9 run and led by at least 13 throughout the fourth quarter. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City won an unprecedented fourth straight English top flight title with a 3-1 win over West Ham United on Sunday to pip rivals Arsenal on the final day of a thrilling Premier League season as the fans turned the pitch into a sea of blue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two glorious early goals from league player of the season Phil Foden created a party atmosphere in the sunshine at the Etihad Stadium, before a stunning bicycle kick from Mohammed Kudus before halftime brought West Ham briefly into the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Rodri sealed the victory with a low 59th minute shot from outside the area, giving Pep Guardiola's side a phenomenal sixth title in seven years. Fans danced in their seats, belting out: "Champions again!" and "Are you watching Arsenal?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the closest title races in Premier League history, Arsenal could have taken the championship had City dropped points. But the Londoners' 2-1 win in their game against Everton was in vain, leaving them two points behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City have the chance of winning the double as they face Manchester United in the FA Cup final next Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden's already brilliant season got even better when he arrowed the ball into the top corner in the second minute then capped a fine team move to sweep home the second in the 18th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so hard to put into words what we've done today," Foden said. "No team has ever done it. You see what it means to the fans and it means to us. Working all year for this moment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought today we just looked confident and just played our football and in the end it paid off."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder has scored 19 league goals this season and has won six Premier League titles at just 23, making him one of England's best hopes for this year's Euros in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the final whistle, the home fans poured onto the pitch, some letting off blue flares in celebration, while the players hugged each other in joy. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen held off a late charge by McLaren's Lando Norris to win the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix by less than a second on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's triple Formula One world champion took the chequered flag just 0.725 of a second ahead of the man who beat him at the previous round in Miami and sensed he might snatch another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Verstappen's fifth in seven races this season, the 59th of his career and the third edition in a row at Imola. Last year's race at the Italian circuit was cancelled due to heavy flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had no grip anymore. I was sliding a lot. I saw Lando closing in. The last 10 laps were flat out," said a relieved Verstappen, who had appeared set for another easy win but had to sweat ultimately for the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's difficult when the tyres were not working anymore and you have to go flat out. I couldn't afford to make too many mistakes. Luckily we didn't."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was third at the Italian team's atmospheric home track, 7.916 off the pace, for his fourth podium finish of the season and a home race to come in Monaco next weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory extended Verstappen's championship lead to 48 points, with Leclerc now his closest rival after Red Bull's Sergio Perez started 11th and finished only eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has 161 points, Leclerc 113 and Perez 107. Red Bull have 268 in the constructors' standings with Ferrari on 212 and McLaren on 154.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri finished fourth, after starting fifth due to a three-place grid penalty for impeding in qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was fifth and the Mercedes pair of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell sixth and seventh on another afternoon to forget for the once-dominant team. (Reuters)

    'Smaller Olympic presence will still be a success'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tony Choi, who heads the Hong Kong Sports Institute, says he hopes Hong Kong can win medals in every Olympic Games from now on. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753787_1_20240519161207.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Tony Choi, said on Sunday that qualifying for fewer events at the Paris Olympics compared with the Tokyo Games will still be considered a success for Hong Kong athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Choi estimated that Hong Kong would qualify for about 30 events in all disciplines this time, about 10 fewer than in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the SAR's success at the Tokyo Games was partly due to its Covid-19 measures, which minimised the pandemic's impact on elite athletes' training and gave Hong Kong the edge over other places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals in Tokyo, its best showing at an Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Hong Kong Sports Institute was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics, we didn't stop training for a single day. I believe many countries and regions couldn't do that. So back then, we had such advantages," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, we're getting more than 30 tickets, which is still reaching our target."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi also expressed hopes of breaking the pattern of Hong Kong winning medals every other Olympics, since windsurfer Lee Lai-shan captured gold in Atlanta in 1996 for the city's first medal ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We got a medal in the 1996 [Olympics], then in 2000 we didn’t. And in 2004 we had one and 2008 we didn’t. 2012 we got a medal then 2016 we didn’t... Honestly speaking, the Hong Kong team’s results are relatively inconsistent. We hope everything can be more stable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope to win at least a medal in every Olympics... We need to maintain a stable performance in the international sports scene in order to compete with other sports powerhouses.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said Hong Kong is already competitive in sports such as fencing, swimming, table tennis, badminton, karate and squash, and it'll take time to catch up in other disciplines.

    Usyk takes undisputed title for first time in 25 years

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Oleksandr Usyk celebrates his points victory over Tyson Fury. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753745_1_20240519083939.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oleksandr Usyk beat Tyson Fury by split decision to win the world's first undisputed heavyweight championship on Sunday, an unprecedented feat in boxing's four-belt era.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Britain's Fury was the early aggressor but Usyk gradually took charge and the "Gypsy King" was saved by the bell in the ninth round before slumping to his first career defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Usyk joins the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight champion, the first since boxing recognised four major belts in the 2000s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the win, the still-undefeated former undisputed cruiserweight champion can legitimately claim to be the best of this era, although a rematch expected in October could provide another twist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a big opportunity for me, for my family, for my country," said Usyk, 37, who briefly served as a soldier after Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a great time, a great day," he said, adding that he was "ready for a rematch".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fury called it a "fantastic fight with Oleksandr".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I won that fight, I believe he won a few of the rounds, but I won the majority of them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know his country is at war, so people are siding with the country at war but make no mistake, I won that fight in my opinion and I will be back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Lennox Lewis was the last man to unify the heavyweight belts -- three at the time -- after beating Evander Holyfield in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two judges scored it for Usyk by scores of 115-112 and 114-113 while the third gave it to Fury 114-113. The victory extended Usyk's professional record to 22-0. After his first loss, Fury stands at 34-1-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk, who adds Fury's WBC belt to his IBF, WBA and WBO titles, looks set to go down as one of the greats after dominating at amateur, cruiserweight and now the top division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fired-up Fury came running out of his corner to start the fight and the 2.06 metre boxer was quickly into his rhythm, keeping the shorter Usyk back with his jab and playing to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk got inside with some quick combinations while Fury landed some heavy body shots. By round four, the Mancunian was taunting his ever-advancing opponent and showboating, guard down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Usyk called two low shots in round five and got caught with a left hook as Fury continued to look comfortable, landing a telling uppercut in the following round and bobbing and weaving to stay out of range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Ukrainian tagged Fury with two clean lefts in the seventh and landed a punishing hook that dazed the "Gypsy King" in the eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the next round, a relentless Usyk barrage had Fury in serious trouble and the wobbling, bleeding Mancunian took a standing count before being saved by the bell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fury recovered his poise and with the match in the balance heading into the final round, both fighters were finding the target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wladimir Klitschko was among the legends watching along with Saudi-based football stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, who like boxing are grateful beneficiaries of the oil-rich monarchy's lavish push into sports. (AFP)

    Lowry matches Schauffele's record PGA round

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Shane Lowry played his way into contention at Valhalla. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753741_1_20240519053336.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shane Lowry matched the lowest round in major golf history on Saturday, shooting a nine-under par 62 in the third round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Irishman tied the mark achieved four prior times, most recently in Thursday's first round by Xander Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other 62s were made by Schauffele and fellow American Rickie Fowler in the first round at last year's US Open and the 2017 British Open by South African Branden Grace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bogey-free round left Lowry, the 2019 British Open winner, on 13-under par 200 for 54 holes, one stroke behind leader Schauffele, who was still on the course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry birdied eight of the first 14 holes at Valhalla to reach 12-under and briefly share the lead, sinking birdie putts of 37 feet at 13 and 32 feet at the par-3 14th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He fired 29 on the front nine with birdies on six of the first nine holes, four of those between 13 and 19 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Lowry sank a birdie putt from just beyond six feet at the par-4 17th, there was a buzz around the course as he walked to the par-5 finishing hole, one softened and more receptive after rain earlier this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 18, Lowry's tee shot found the left rough and his second shot landed in the left rough, but his third drew wild applause, setting him up for a birdie putt from just inside 12 feet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry's bid to make the first 61 in major championship history missed but he tapped in for 62 and a share of history. (AFP)

    Verstappen ties Senna record with Imola pole

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull's Max Verstappen equalled Ayrton Senna's record of eight pole positions in a row with the fastest lap in qualifying for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The late Brazilian's run was set in 1988/89 with McLaren and Verstappen, also a triple Formula One world champion, started his sequence in Abu Dhabi at the end of last season and has yet to be out-qualified in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's 39th career pole came as Formula One marks 30 years since Senna, who had 65 poles, died in a crash at the Italian circuit on May 1, 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a great start to the year and very special," said the Dutch driver after also matching Alain Prost's record 1993 seven successive poles at the start of a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's 30 years since he (Senna) passed away, so very pleased to get pole and in a way it's a nice memory to him. He was an incredible F1 driver, especially in qualifying," added Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri joined the championship leader provisionally on the front row, with stewards investigating the Australian for possibly impeding Haas's Kevin Magnussen in the first phase of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris, a first time winner at the previous race in Miami, qualified third for McLaren with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc completing the second row at the Italian team's home circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are getting closer. To be ahead of Ferrari is also a nice result for us," said Norris. "It's going to be close, it's going to be a good race tomorrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully it's an exciting one. Tough, especially when the lap times are so tight. A lot of it is down to lap one, strategy and the pit stops." (Reuters)

    Coach De Zerbi to depart Brighton

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Roberto De Zerbi is on his way out of Brighton. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753724_1_20240518231611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton & Hove Albion coach Roberto De Zerbi will leave the club after their final match of the season against Manchester United, the Premier League club said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  De Zerbi joined Brighton in September 2022 when he replaced Graham Potter and made an instant impact when he secured their highest top-flight finish (sixth) and helped them qualify for European competition for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season, Brighton reached the last 16 of the Europa League but struggled in the Premier League where they are 10th going into the final day of the season on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Roberto has given us two excellent seasons of service in which he has led the club to new heights, not least our first ever European campaign which will live long in the memory of Albion fans," club chairman Tony Bloom said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have mutually agreed to end Roberto's contract at a time that suits both parties allowing us the earliest opportunity to plan for next season, and Roberto plenty of time to consider his next move and his future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian manager earned plaudits for an entertaining brand of football based on possession while he also nurtured young talents who were able to thrive in his system even as the club lost major players to bigger teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very sad to be leaving Brighton, but I am very proud of what my players and staff have achieved with the support of everyone at the club and our amazing fans in the past two historical seasons," De Zerbi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have really enjoyed an intense and challenging two years working in the Premier League, not least competing in four major competitions this season. Leaving now provides me with time to take a break before deciding on my future plans." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Golf world number one Scottie Scheffler was handcuffed and arrested by police early on Friday after allegedly dragging a police officer with his car while trying to avoid traffic controls outside the PGA Championship at Valhalla.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In one of the strangest scenes ever at a major tournament, Scheffler was taken into custody by police, booked with a mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit, released, then taken back to the course for breakfast and practice before finally teeing off in the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was detained by Louisville Metro police after he drove onto curbing to try and get around an accident at the entrance of the golf course, one that resulted in the fatality of a pedestrian, and was confronted by police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic and released on his own recognisance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While on the driving range preparing to tee off, Scheffler released a statement about the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers," Scheffler said. "It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never intended to disregard any of the instructions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today. Of course, all of us involved in the tournament express our deepest sympathies to the family of the man who passed away in the earlier accident this morning. It truly puts everything into perspective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police report on the incident obtained by ESPN said arresting officer Bryan Gillis says Scheffler disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, dragging the officer to the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gillis was hospitalised with pain, bruising and swelling in his left wrist and knee. An arraignment is set for Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time Masters champion Scheffler arrived at Valhalla's clubhouse about 30 minutes after his release and just under an hour before his start time off the 10th tee in the second round, which began after an 80-minute delay due to the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were devastated to learn that a worker with one of our vendors was tragically struck and killed by a shuttle bus outside Valhalla Golf Club," the PGA of America said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is heartbreaking to all of us involved with the PGA Championship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was driven, by the owner of Valhalla Golf Club according to ESPN, to the clubhouse, where he ate breakfast and changed into his golf apparel before going to the practice range to prepare for his round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a tough deal," said Scheffler playing partner Brian Harman, the 2023 British Open winner. "But I'm glad to see him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fans cheered as Scheffler walked through the rain onto the par-5 10th tee and gave him a huge ovation just before he struck his first shot into the right rough on his way to an opening birdie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, who won his second Masters title last month, is trying to become the first player since 2015 to win the first two majors in a calendar year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio reported Scheffler was booked into custody by police at 7:38 a.m. before Scheffler's mugshot in an orange jumpsuit was posted by the Louisville Metropolitan Department of Corrections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ESPN's Jeff Darlington posted a video on X of Scheffler, wearing shorts and T-shirt, with his hands held behind his back, being led away by police in the pre-dawn incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Darlington said Scheffler was unaware a person at the entrance was a police officer because they were clad in a yellow rain poncho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was the feel-good story of the week at Valhalla, hoping to win his third career major title a week after becoming a father for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His wife, Meredith, gave birth to son Bennett nine days ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler fired a four-under par 67 in Thursday's opening round, but began Friday five strokes adrift of leader Xander Schauffele, the world number three who matched the lowest round in major golf history with a 62 Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, 27, has won four of his past five starts, capturing titles at Bay Hill and the Players in March, losing in a playoff at the Houston Open, then winning the Masters and Heritage crowns last month. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Feyenoord coach Arne Slot confirmed on Friday that he would be replacing Jurgen Klopp as manager of Liverpool next season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There hasn't be an official announcement yet – but I don't think it will come as news to you that I will be coach there next season," Feyenoord boss Slot told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK media said last month that Slot's deal to replace Klopp was worth up to £9.4 million (10.9 million euros)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot moved to Feyenoord in 2021 after impressing in his first managerial role at AZ Alkmaar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He led the Dutch giants to the inaugural Europa Conference League final at the end of his first season, in which they narrowly lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho's Roma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot then delivered just a second league title in 24 years to De Kuip last season before penning a new three-year deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klopp will step down at the end of this season after a nine-year reign which brought the Champions League title in 2019 and Premier League trophy a year later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initially, Bayer Leverkusen boss and former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso had been the favourite to succeed Klopp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Alonso has committed to staying at Leverkusen after leading them to a first-ever Bundesliga title. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Minnesota Timberwolves overwhelmed the Denver Nuggets 115-70 to force the defending NBA champions to a decisive game seven in their Western Conference semifinal series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anthony Edwards shook off an injury scare to finish with 27 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals as the young, hungry Timberwolves fended off elimination against Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets, who had won the previous three games to take charge of the best-of-seven series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 21 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Minnesota finished with a 62-43 advantage in rebounds and the Timberwolves reserves outscored the Nuggets bench 36-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets will host the winner-take-all game seven on Monday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm super-pumped for it," 22-year-old Edwards said of the chance to eliminate the Nuggets on their home floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But McDaniels cautioned that the Nuggets would be ready as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not over," McDaniels said. "We're just going to try to keep this intensity for the next game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall, the Timberwolves absorbed an early punch, falling behind 9-2 before exploding for a 20-0 scoring run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They out-scored the Nuggets 31-14 in the first quarter, dominating in the paint and winning the rebounding battle 19-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denver went nearly six minutes without scoring, the crowd at the Target Center in Minneapolis growing more frenzied as the Timberwolves' lead grew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another surge by Denver to open the second quarter was quickly repelled with a 13-0 Minnesota run that featured back-to-back baskets from Naz Reid and a three-pointer from Edwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every time the Nuggets looked to be gaining momentum Minnesota responded -- their energy rewarded once again as McDaniels grabbed the rebound from a Reid miss for a second-chance basket at the halftime buzzer, giving the Timberwolves a 59-40 lead at the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberwolves coach Chris Finch was pleased with a bounce-back performance from his team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were two responses," Finch said. "There was the response to the last three games, but the most important response was when we got down 9-2. And we did a really good job of focusing and coming back with the right energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards said he banged his tailbone, but would be ready for Game 7. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jarry celebrates his Rome Open quarter-final win over Stefanos Tsitsipas. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753488_1_20240517074038.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chilean 21st seed Nicolas Jarry fought back from a set down to beat world number eight Stefanos Tsitsipas 3-6 7-5 6-4 and reach the Italian Open semi-finals on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jarry, who fought off 11 of 13 break points faced in the match, will next play American 14th seed Tommy Paul on Friday in his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Chilean, Alejandro Tabilo will take on German third seed Alexander Zverev the other semi-final. Two Chileans will appear in the semi-finals of an ATP 1000 event for the first time since the format was introduced in 1990.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarry was tested in the opening set by Greece's sixth seed but gained his momentum in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old won five consecutive points at 3-3 as he bounced back from 0-40, before wrapping up the second set by winning nine of the final 11 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jarry then broke Tsitsipas in the decider for a 5-4 lead to eventually cruise into the last four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Thursday, Paul came through a marathon match to beat Polish seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz 7-5 3-6 6-3 to book his spot in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American, who defeated defending champion Daniil Medvedev in the previous round, had yet to drop a set before the quarter-final, but Hurkacz managed to force the match into the decider before Paul came out on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a match which went back and forth with 13 breaks of serve overall. The pair exchanged breaks early in the opening set, with Paul breaking twice to lead 3-2. With Paul serving for the set, Hurkacz broke again to make it 5-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul broke back immediately and held serve to take the first set. The American made a strong start to the second, breaking in the first game, but Hurkacz came back, breaking twice to force a third set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time it was the Pole who took an early 2-0 lead, but they again exchanged breaks of serve to make it 3-3 before Paul made the decisive break to go 5-3 up, and then saved six break points to wrap up victory. (Reuters)

    Schauffele equals major record low round to lead PGA
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Xander Schauffele smiles on the eighth green. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753487_1_20240517073357.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele set the early target at the PGA Championship, firing a record equalling opening round nine-under 62 at Valhalla Golf Club on Thursday as the Olympic champion looked to atone for a shock loss at the Wells Fargo.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Schauffele, who held a final round two stroke lead at Quail Hollow on Sunday before losing by five shots to Rory McIlroy, was a man on a mission in Louisville and he matched the men's major championship low score – for the second time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an Olympic gold medal in Tokyo and an proven ability to go low, the 30-year-old American has yet to win a major and is without a win since the 2022 Scottish Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While there is a lot of golf to be played, the world number three signalled he plans to end both droughts with a brilliant error-free opening round that matched his first round effort at last year's U.S. Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll take a 62 in any major any day," said Schauffele. "Not winning makes you want to win more, as weird as that is.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The top feels far away, and I feel like I have a lot of work to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perhaps, but Schauffele's 62 will be tough to beat on a sunny day at Valhalla. He is sitting in the clubhouse a comfortable three shots clear of Tony Finau and Sahith Theegala on six-under 65.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lurking four off the pace on five-under are red hot world number two McIlroy and Scotsman Robert MacIntyre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, coming off back-to-back PGA Tour wins, carried that momentum into the first round. He rolled in a six-footer for a birdie on his opening hole, the par five 10th, then picked up a second at the 13th to briefly join a crowd at the top of the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Northern Irishman, who announced on Monday that he had filed for divorce, stalled after the early burst. He took a bogey at the 17th before hitting his stride again after the turn by carding four birdies, including three straight from the fifth coming home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending champion and LIV Golf standard bearer Brooks Koepka, bidding to become the tournament's first repeat winner since he retained the title in 2019, looked a threat to add a fourth Wanamaker trophy to his collection after returning a four-under 67 highlighted by an eagle, birdie, par finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiger Woods, who collected one of his 15 major titles at Valhalla in 2000 with a playoff win over Bob May, opened with a one-over 72 but lamented a sloppy bogey, bogey finish to his day. (Reuters)

 Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson will miss Sunday's concluding game of the Premier League season and next week's FA Cup final, the club announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Brazilian was forced off with a facial injury during City's 2-0 win over Tottenham on Tuesday that left Pep Guardiola's men on the brink of an unprecedented fourth successive English top-flight title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scans have confirmed Ederson suffered a small fracture to the right eye socket following a collision with Cristian Romero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will now miss Sunday's league game at home to West Ham and the FA Cup final against Manchester United at Wembley the following week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City, two points clear of Arsenal, will guarantee the Premier League title if they beat West Ham at the Etihad. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World basketball's governing body, FIBA, said on Thursday that it will bring another major tournament to Hong Kong later this year, with the world's best 3x3 men's teams battling it out for the World Tour title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's World Tour will feature 17 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 31 points in a triple-double, and the Dallas Mavericks beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 104-92 to take a 3-2 lead in the Western Conference semifinal series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Doncic, the league's leading scorer in the regular season, had struggled some in the series against Oklahoma City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Playing through a sprained right knee and a sore left ankle, he had averaged just 22 points on 39% shooting through the first four games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in Game 5, he made 12 of 22 field goals and had 11 assists and 10 rebounds for his sixth career playoff triple-double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Derrick Jones Jr. scored a playoff career-high 19 points and P.J. Washington Jr. added 10 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas, which shot 52.6% from the floor. The No. 5-seeded Mavericks can advance to the Western Conference finals with a win at home on Sunday morning Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 30 points for the top-seeded Thunder, but no other Oklahoma City player scored more than 13 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks won Game 5 on the road, just like they did in the first round against the Los Angeles Clippers. Dallas held Oklahoma City to 42.5% shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma City tried to jump-start its struggling offense by replacing Josh Giddey with Isaiah Joe in the starting lineup. Giddey did not start for the first time in 229 combined regular season and postseason games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas led by 15 in the second quarter and took a 54-44 edge into halftime. Jones scored 15 points before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gilgeous-Alexander scored 14 points in the third quarter, but Dallas still led 79-67.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Thunder never got closer than seven points in the final period. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum scored 25 points as the Boston Celtics overpowered the injury-hit Cleveland Cavaliers 113-98 to book their place in the Eastern Conference finals for the third straight year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded Celtics won the series 4-1, yet they were pushed all the way by a battling Cleveland team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs' hopes of clawing their way back into the best-of-seven series were rocked before the game as three of their top six players -- Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert -- were confirmed to be out with injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Cleveland shrugged off that setback to produce a battling performance that saw them get within three points of the Celtics midway through the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evan Mobley was superb for Cleveland, pouring in a game-high 33 points while Marcus Morris Sr. added 25 off the bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet just when Celtics fans at the TD Garden were nervously wondering if a shock defeat was on the cards, Boston stitched together a decisive 13-2 run -- crowned by a three-pointer from Tatum -- that left them ahead by 14 points at 101-87.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tatum, who also added 10 rebounds and nine assists, said Boston had prepared for a dogfight despite Cleveland's injury-stricken line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anybody who's played in this league understands what happens when somebody's best players are out," Tatum said. "The rest of the guys have more freedom. They play with a different level of confidence and they play different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our mindset coming into this game was 'However long it takes, that's how long it takes'. We didn't expect to win the game in the first or second quarter. We grinded it out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tatum said Boston were now determined to snap their dismal recent record in the Eastern Conference finals. Boston have lost in the Eastern Conference finals in four of five appearances since the 2016-2017 season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The superstar forward was one of six Boston players to finish in double figures. Al Horford shrugged off his recent struggles to post 22 points and 15 rebounds, while Derrick White scored 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics will face either the New York Knicks or the Indiana Pacers for a place in the NBA Finals. (AFP)

    Man Utd down Magpies to keep alive European hopes

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United kept alive their hopes of salvaging a dismal season by qualifying for Europe as Amad Diallo's rocket inspired a 3-2 win against Newcastle on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's side are battling to secure a seventh place finish in the Premier League, which could secure a place in next season's UEFA Conference League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United will qualify for the Europa League if they win the FA Cup final against Manchester City on May 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But if City triumph at Wembley then seventh will be enough for a Conference League spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And eighth-placed United are still in the hunt for that place after beating Newcastle to move level on points with the seventh-placed Magpies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goals from Kobbie Mainoo, Diallo and Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford gave United only their third win in nine league games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, United's goal difference is vastly inferior to Newcastle's, meaning they must better the Magpies' result in the last game of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United travel to Brighton on Sunday, while Newcastle head to Brentford.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's defeat means fifth-placed Tottenham are guaranteed to be in the Europa League next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixth placed Chelsea won 2-1 at Brighton in Wednesday's other game to move closer to European qualification after a turbulent campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead with the 22nd league goal of his superb season in the 34th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Christopher Nkunku doubled Chelsea's advantage in the 64th minute with his third league goal of an injury-plagued first season with the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mauricio Pochettino's side host Bournemouth on Sunday knowing a draw will be enough to earn a European berth, with fifth place still in play if they win and Tottenham lose at Sheffield United. (AFP)

    Zverev beats injury scare to reach Rome semis

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alexander Zverev celebrates his quarter final win. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753332_1_20240516080755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alexander Zverev reached his 18th Masters semi-final in Rome on Wednesday but only after a worrying fall which sparked memories of the horror injury he suffered at the French Open two years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number five from Germany defeated Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 to set up a last-four duel with Alejandro Tabilo, the Chilean journeyman who had stunned Novak Djokovic earlier in the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev's moment of concern came in just the third game on centre court at the Foro Italico when he fell on the clay and landed on his front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2017 champion cut his left wrist and a finger in the tumble and required treatment from the tournament physio before he continued the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev, 27, suffered a serious ankle injury at the 2022 French Open after falling on the clay of Roland Garros during his semi-final against Rafael Nadal and missed the rest of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, however, he was able to dust himself down to defeat Fritz in 90 minutes, firing 20 winners with six aces and not facing a single break point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chile's Tabilo will play his first-ever Masters 1000 semi-final at the age of 26, after seeing off unseeded Zhang Zhizhen of China 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 26 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's second seed Aryna Sabalenka needed just an hour and 13 minutes to see off Jelena Ostapenko 6-2, 6-4 on her way to the semis, improving her record against her Latvian opponent to three wins and no defeats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka will next take on Miami Open winner Danielle Collins who eased past Victoria Azarenka 6-4, 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old could get a rematch of the Madrid final which she lost in dramatic fashion to world number one Iga Swiatek earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rome is the first time since the 2013 French Open that the top three women have reached the last four of a WTA event of 250 level or higher, with Swiatek and world number three Coco Gauff in the other semi-final on Thursday. (AFP)

    English Premier League clubs to vote on scrapping VAR
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The EPL's controversial VAR system could be shown the red card in June. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753314_1_20240516022914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs will be given the chance to scrap VAR from next season when they vote on the controversial review system at their annual general meeting next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wolves have submitted a resolution to abolish VAR to the Premier League, triggering a vote of the top flight's 20 teams on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Molineux club said VAR is "undermining the value of the Premier League brand" after another season marred by a host of debatable decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In order for VAR to be axed by the Premier League, 14 of the 20 clubs will have to vote against it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves are expected to canvas other clubs in order to gain support before the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VAR was introduced in the Premier League in 2019 with the aim of helping referees avoid clear and obvious errors that had marred matches in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there have been numerous controversies surrounding the technology this season as Premier League managers and fans grow increasingly vocal in their disdain for the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The introduction of VAR in 2019/20 was a decision made in good faith and with the best interests of football and the Premier League at its heart," a Wolves statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, it has led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The decision to table the resolution has come after careful consideration and with the utmost respect for the Premier League, PGMOL and our fellow competitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our position is that the price we are paying for a small increase in accuracy is at odds with the spirit of our game, and as a result we should remove it from the 2024/25 season onwards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves boss Gary O'Neil revealed he has regularly received apologetic phone calls from Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) chief Howard Webb after VAR decisions that went against his team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of VAR on goal celebrations, the length of time taken for checks and a lack of communication in the stadium are all issues that have irked supporters and cited by Wolves as reasons for scrapping the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Premier League believes VAR is still a valuable tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The English top flight, which is in regular dialogue with referees' governing body PGMOL, believes the number of incorrect decisions would increase without VAR which could damage the competition's reputation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Premier League can confirm it will facilitate a discussion on VAR with our clubs at the Annual General Meeting next month," a Premier League spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Clubs are entitled to put forward proposals at Shareholders' meetings and we acknowledge the concerns and issues around the use of VAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, the League fully supports the use of VAR and remains committed, alongside PGMOL, to make continued improvements to the system for the benefit of the game and fans." (AFP)

    Rangers lift Sapling Cup in veterans’ final game

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former SAR football internationals Lam Ka-wai and Lo Kwan-yee received the perfect send-offs before their retirement as they led Hong Kong Rangers to a 1-0 victory against Kitchee in the Sapling Cup final on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rangers still have a game to go in the Premier League season, but the veterans decided to make the cup final at Mong Kok Stadium their last game before hanging up their boots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Midfielder Lam, a traditional number ten, captained underdogs Rangers, who took the lead late in the first half when striker Nassam Ibrahim scored a header from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defender Lo, 39, came on as a substitute in the second half to fortify Rangers’ defence, which stubbornly turned away the Kitchee advances for a magical victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the game, Lam, 38, thanked both Rangers and Kitchee, a club he also spent more than a decade with, for giving him the opportunities as a player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The playmaker said he was particularly grateful to his mother club Rangers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After Covid, I was a jobless footballer for a period of time. They quickly called me and asked me to join the team,” Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo, for his part, said jokingly he’s upset that Lam didn’t thank him. But he wanted to thank his teammate anyway, saying they’ve gone through so much together in their careers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was capped 51 times by Hong Kong, China, scoring nine goals. Lo also found the net nine times during the 53 games he represented the SAR.

    Haaland double puts Man City on brink of EPL history

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Erling Haaland's late penalty leaves City just 90 minutes away from another slice of English football history. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753200_1_20240515054752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland scored twice to settle Manchester City's nerves as the Premier League champions beat Tottenham 2-0 to take a giant step towards a historic fourth consecutive English title on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian forward tapped home a pinpoint Kevin De Bruyne cross early in the second half to score City's first-ever league goal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and netted a late penalty to seal the three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It takes Pep Guardiola's team two points clear of Arsenal at the top of the table and means victory at the Etihad against West Ham on Sunday will make them champions for a fourth straight season, regardless of the Gunners' result against Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No team in English top-flight history has ever won four titles in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat for Spurs also guarantees that Aston Villa will finish in the fourth Champions League spot, joining City, Arsenal and Liverpool in Europe's top-tier competition next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The build-up to the game in north London was dominated by a fierce debate over whether home fans wanted their own team to lose in order to leave City in the driving seat, with Arsenal their nearest challengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spurs supporters made their feelings towards their bitter local rivals clear in the opening minutes, with chants of "Stand up if you hate Arsenal" ringing around the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides settled quickly and Spurs had the first sight of goal when a raking ball from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg found Brennan Johnson on the right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson squared for Rodrigo Bentancur, who unleashed a fierce shot that Ederson tipped over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario kept out Phil Foden's close-range shot after 15 minutes with a strong right hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City, who came into the match on an unbeaten run of 21 matches, were short of their fluent best while Spurs struggled to put the finishing touches to their attacking moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game opened up towards the end of the first period, with City defender Josko Gvardiol flashing a shot over the bar from a tight angle but the sides finished the opening 45 minutes with just one shot on target apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments after the re-start Vicario was forced to dive full length to keep out a stinging De Bruyne effort while Son Heung-min went close at the other end after being found by Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But City broke the deadlock in the 51st minute when Bernardo Silva found De Bruyne in the box and the Belgian crossed for Haaland to slot home from point-blank range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of Spurs fans chanted "Are you watching Arsenal" as the City fans celebrated in their corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game then became disjointed as first De Bruyne was hurt by a Pape Sarr tackle on his ankle before Ederson took a blow to the head in denying Cristian Romero and was replaced minutes later by Stefan Ortega.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German was called into action immediately, keeping out substitute Dejan Kulusevski's close-range shot with his legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors' hearts were in their mouths when Son burst through with five minutes of normal time remaining but Ortega saved with his legs when he seemed likely to score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guardiola fell to the ground, clutching his head in disbelief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead City were awarded a penalty when Pedro Porro brought down substitute Jeremy Doku and Haaland smashed home in the 91st minute to spark wild celebrations from the players in front of the City faithful, taking his league tally to 27 goals for the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year's treble winners will prepare for Sunday's finale knowing they stand just 90 minutes away from creating another slice of football history. (AFP)

    NBA fines T-Wolves center Gobert US$75,000 for gesture

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert was fined US$75,000 by the NBA on Tuesday for what the league called "making an inappropriate and unprofessional gesture" questioning "the integrity of the league and game officials."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Frenchman Gobert was seen by television cameras rubbing his thumb on his fingers in a "money-sorting" gesture during Minnesota's 115-107 loss to defending NBA champion Denver on Sunday at Minneapolis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move came after Gobert was whistled for a foul with 4:10 remaining in the fourth quarter, his second foul in as many Denver possessions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gobert won his record-tying fourth NBA Defensive Player of the Year award last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defeat left the T-Wolves and Nuggets level at two wins each in their best-of-seven Western Conference second round series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBA said the fine takes into account Gobert's "history of improper conduct toward game officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gobert was fined US$100,000 by the NBA on March 10 for making the same gesture in a 113-104 overtime loss at Cleveland two nights earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After that contest, Gobert said gambling was hurting the sport. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics fought off a spirited challenge from short-handed Cleveland Monday, beating the Cavaliers 109-102 to take a commanding 3-1 lead in their NBA Eastern Conference semi-final series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum scored 33 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jaylen Brown added 27 points for the Celtics, who will try to finish off the best-of-seven series at home on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavaliers were dealt a heavy blow when Donovan Mitchell, who had averaged more than 35 points over the six prior games, was ruled out with a calf injury, joining starting centre Jarrett Allen on the sidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NBA superstar LeBron James, who led the Cavs to their only NBA title back in 2016, was sitting courtside, but with Mitchell absent the Cavs ultimately didn't have enough firepower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavs kept the pressure on, taking the lead briefly on Darius Garland's driving basket early in the third quarter – their first lead since the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Celtics quickly reasserted themselves and led by 10 going into the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland, on the back of 30 points from Garland, pulled within five points three times in the final four minutes, but Brown, fed by Tatum, connected on a three-pointer with 1:09 to play that effectively sealed it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a game of runs," Tatum said after the Celtics struggled to put the depleted Cavaliers away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not going to be perfect every single time. They're going to make shots, but it's our job to figure it out." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, preparing for his first professional fight since 2005, warned YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul on Monday that his life will be on the line during their July 20 bout.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 57-year-old Tyson, speaking at New York City's Apollo Theater during a press conference to promote a fight against an opponent who is 30 years his junior, said he wants to show the world he is still a great fighter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really like Jake a lot but once he's in that ring he has to fight like his life depends on it, because it will be," said Tyson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavyweight bout at the Arlington, Texas home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys will be contested over eight two-minute rounds with each fighter using 14-ounce gloves. The outcome will be included in both fighters' professional boxing records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyson, who said he requested the shorter rounds because he feels it will lead to greater action and a more entertaining fight, shot back at critics who suggested he is making a big mistake by returning to boxing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people who said that wish they were up here," said Tyson. "Because no one else can do it. Who else can do this? Who else can shut the sporting world down, no one else can do it. So you got the both of us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're friends, but in that ring we're not going to be friends."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyson also said he did not hesitate at the chance to fight Paul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a no-brainer," said Tyson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was the new up and coming guy on the scene and I like shaking the sports world to it's core and I'm doing it now. It's just something I want to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul, a 27-year-old YouTube influencer-turned-boxer, has won nine of 10 boxing matches with six knockouts against a mix of celebrities and middling fighters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He suffered his sole career boxing loss in February 2023 when he lost a split decision to Tommy Fury, the half brother of World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Tyson Fury. (Reuters)

    Duran double salvages draw for Villa against Liverpool

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jhon Duran scores just 6 minutes after coming on as a substitute.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Jhon Duran scored two late goals as Aston Villa fought back to salvage a 3-3 home draw with Liverpool on Monday and take a significant step towards a place in the Champions League next season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A match that started with Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez conceding a shocking second minute own-goal turned into a thriller with Duran coming on to save the night with goals in the 85th and 88th minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa are now on 68 points with one game remaining, five clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur who have two matches still to come.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool were gifted the opener when Argentine international Martinez fumbled a tame Harvey Elliot cross, desperately clawing the ball across the line and into his own net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa, who would have secured fourth place with a win and must now wait for Tottenham's home game against title-chasers Manchester City on Tuesday, equalised 10 minutes later through Youri Tielemans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cody Gakpo made it 2-1 to the third-placed visitors in the 23rd, after a VAR check for offside, and Jarell Quansah then headed in off the post from a free kick for his first Premier League goal in the 48th. (Reuters)

    Swiatek shrugs off climate protests at Rome Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Poland's Iga Swiatek signs autographs after winning her round of 16 match against Germany's Angelique Kerber. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753029_1_20240514001701.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iga Swiatek saw off Angelique Kerber 7-5, 6-3 at the Rome Open on Monday to set up a quarter-final clash with Madison Keys, who came through against Sorana Cirstea despite her match being interrupted by climate activists.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number one Swiatek is yet to drop a set and is favourite for a third Foro Italico crown before she begins her French Open title defence later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time Roland Garros champion arrived in the Italian capital off the back of a thrilling triumph in Madrid, her third WTA 1000 title of the season after also winning at Indian Wells and Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 22-year-old didn't have it all her own way against former world number one Kerber, a three-time former Grand Slam champion who at 331st was the lowest-ranked player ever to reach the last 16 in this tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek battled to the first set in just under an hour and was frequently put to the test by 36-year-old German Kerber, who fell behind after saving five set points in game 10 and then succumbing two games later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kerber went two ahead in the second set but Swiatek fought back and after the Pole broke serve in game eight she held steady to close out the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek will face Keys whose 6-2, 6-1 win was suspended for half an hour by a court invasion from activists from Ultima Generazione (Last Generation).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wearing orange vests, protestors threw a liquid and confetti onto the Pietrangeli court, where Keys was playing, and court 12 where a men's doubles match was taking place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also protestors in the stands with a tournament spokesman telling AFP that at least one person had tried to glue their feet to the floor in order to slow their removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it's not the greatest feeling when you're on court, your first reaction is kind of your own safety," said Keys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think maybe banning cementing glue from bags would be a start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's obviously something that's becoming more of an occurence and something that tournaments are going to have to figure out how to stop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniil Medvedev will continue his title defence against Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic with the men's tournament wide open following a series of big-name exits, the latest being fourth seed Andrey Rublev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rome is missing the world's top three men following Novak Djokovic's early elimination on Saturday, with Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz both withdrawing ahead of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Russian Rublev, fresh from claiming the Madrid title, suffered a shock third-round defeat by French qualifier Alexandre Muller, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixth seed and reigning Monte Carlo champion Stefanos Tsitsipas is still in the fray after beating Briton Cameron Norrie in straight sets 6-2, 7-6 (7/1).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naomi Osaka's return to the Rome Open was ended at the last 16 by China's Zheng Qinwen who breezed past her four-time Grand Slam winning opponent 6-2, 6-4 to set up a last-eight clash with third seed Coco Gauff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's Osaka, who has never won a title on clay, was playing at the Foro Italico for the first time in three years after taking a break from the tour to have her first child and is ranked at 173 in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I'm happy with my performance in Rome. It's been a while since I played well on -- I guess I've never played well on clay -- so I guess I'm happy," Osaka told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka will face Elina Svitolina for the first time since their handshake row at last year's French Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belarusian second seed Sabalenka was accused by Ukraine's Svitolina of inflaming tensions surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war after the Roland Garros quarter-final between the pair in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka waited at the net for a handshake after beating Svitolina, even though Svitolina had already insisted she was not going to offer one, as all Ukraine players refused to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian rivals in protest at the ongoing war. (AFP)

    All Blacks captain Cane to retire from internationals

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand captain Sam Cane will retire from Test rugby at the end of 2024, the side said Monday, calling time on a World Cup winning 12-year international career.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Having played 95 Tests -- 27 as captain -- the 32-year-old has decided to focus on spending more time with family and sign a long-term contract with Suntory Goliath in Tokyo," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His retirement is not a complete surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks haven't played since they were defeated in the Rugby World Cup final by South Africa last year and Cane was already on a sabbatical in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane won the World Cup with New Zealand in 2015 and has twice been part of Super Rugby championship-winning sides with the Waikato Chiefs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his experience since taking over as All Blacks captain from Kieran Read in 2020 was not always smooth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane at times struggled with his own form and was sent off during last year's Rugby World Cup final in the 28th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With talents such as of Ardie Savea and Dalton Papalii snapping at his heels, there had been calls for him to be dropped from the side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his tenure New Zealand lost a first Test series at home to Ireland in 2022 and a few weeks later suffered a shock defeat to Argentina in Christchurch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cane will return to New Zealand at the end of the current Japanese club season and will be eligible to be selected for the All Blacks for the rest of 2024, but will no longer be captain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's part of the natural process that happens in rugby," Cane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had my time as captain and it was a huge honour and privilege." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The defending champion Denver Nuggets outgunned the Minnesota Timberwolves 115-107 to level their NBA playoff series on Sunday as the Indiana Pacers pulled even with the New York Knicks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets, fueled by 35 points from NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, Aaron Gordon's 27 points on ruthlessly efficient 11-of-12 shooting and 19 points from Jamal Murray, claimed a second straight win in Minneapolis to knot their best-of-seven Western Conference semi-final series at two games apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pacers dismantled the Knicks 121-89 in Indianapolis to level their Eastern Conference semi-final at 2-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets withstood a 44-point performance from Anthony Edwards, but the Timberwolves star just didn't have enough scoring support despite an energetic effort from the hosts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards' dunk with less than a minute left in the first half cut what had been a 16-point deficit to seven.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic then came up with a steal and fed Michael Porter Jr. for a dunk and Murray grabbed a steal, turned and unleashed a buzzer-beating shot from beyond the halfcourt line that swished through and sent the Nuggets into the break with a 64-49 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray scored 12 points in the third quarter to keep the Nuggets in control as early foul trouble sent Jokic to the bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic returned to score 16 in the fourth and the Nuggets kept the Timberwolves at bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indianapolis, the Pacers finally got their high-octane offence firing. After the first two games of the series came down to the final minutes the Pacers fashioned a blow-out as a raft of injuries at last caught up with the weary Knicks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 20 points and the Pacers connected on 56.8 percent of their shots, drilling 14 three-pointers and dominating in the paint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  T.J. McConnell scored 15 points off the bench for Indiana, who had six players score in double figures. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zhang Zhizhen advanced to the fourth round of the ATP Rome Open after a convincing 6-2, 6-4 win over American Ben Shelton, on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang managed to save two break points and had four unforced errors compared to Shelton's 15, as he dispatched the 12th seed in 71 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ranked 56th globally, Zhang is set to face Brazilian qualifier Thiago Monteiro next. Monteiro progressed after a closely contested match against Serbia's 31st seed, Miomir Kecmanovic, winning 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 [6].
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang's showing in Rome so far marks an improvement for the 27-year-old, who faced first-round exits in his previous two clay tournaments in Barcelona and Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Number 3 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany had a better day than Shelton. Zverev smashed 12 aces and advanced past Italy's Luciano Darderi 7-6 [3], 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also moving to the fourth round of the clay-court event was eighth-seeded Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, who defeated qualifier Terence Atmane of France 7-6 [3], 6-3 in one hour, 44 minutes. Dimitrov will be making his fourth appearance in the fourth round but first since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next up for Dimitrov will be 11th-seeded Taylor Fritz, who knocked out 24th-seeded Sebastian Korda 6-3, 6-4 in an All-American clash. (Xinhua/AFP)

 Rose Zhang produced a scintillating late rally to sweep past Madelene Sagstrom and claim her second professional title with victory at the LPGA Founders Cup in New Jersey on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old from California rattled off four birdies in her final five holes to card a six-under par 66 to finish on 24-under, two shots clear of Sweden's Sagstrom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In cool, overcast conditions at the Upper Montclair Country Club in Clifton, overnight leader Sagstrom had looked to be cruising to victory after rolling in her fifth birdie of the day on the 12th to go three shots clear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagstrom retained that hefty three-shot cushion after parring the 13th along with Zhang, who gave no clue of the pyrotechnics to follow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang pulled a shot back with a birdie on the par-five 14th, and then got to within one after a superb tee-shot set up a birdie chance on the par-three 15th which she converted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the pressure building, Sagstrom then cracked on the 16th, under-hitting a chip onto the green which left her a long par putt that she missed to card a bogey five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That left Zhang as co-leader and the youngster duly seized her chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another dazzling tee-shot on the par-three 17th left her a three-foot putt for birdie which she rolled in to move one shot clear, and then she sealed victory on 18 with a nerveless birdie putt from 10 feet. (AFP)

    Arsenal beat United to go back on top - for now

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal kept their Premier League title dreams alive by ending an Old Trafford hoodoo to grind out a 1-0 win at Manchester United on Sunday to move back top of the table.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leandro Trossard scored the only goal on 20 minutes as Arsenal won for just the second time in 17 games away at United to go a point clear at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester City still have the destiny of the title in their own hands as the defending champions have two matches left to Arsenal's one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Gunners kept the pressure on Pep Guardiola's men ahead of their tricky trip to Tottenham on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat further dented United's chances of competing in Europe next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's men showed more spirit than in a dismal 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday, but have now won just one of their last eight Premier League games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United remain eighth in the table, three points adrift of both Newcastle, who they face on Wednesday, and Chelsea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have been in scintillating form in 2024 to remain in the race for their first league title in 20 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Arteta's men have won 15 and drawn one of their 17 league games since the turn of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Arsenal were far from their flowing best as the expected onslaught of an injury-ravaged United never materialised under unusually stifling heat in England's north-west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The manner of defeat at Palace had increased the scrutiny on United boss Ten Hag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made three changes to the team swept aside at Selhurst Park as Scott McTominay, Sofyan Amrabat and Amad Diallo came in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman's options were again hamstrung by a lengthy list of absentees with captain Bruno Fernandes among those sidelined and a bench littered with youngsters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his decision to retain Casemiro as a makeshift centre-back after his woeful showing against Palace will become another stick to beat the beleaguered coach with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazil captain was dropped from their squad for the Copa America in midweek due to his terrible form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After United had managed to keep the free-scoring visitors at bay for the opening 20 minutes, Casemiro was culpable for the opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old was laboured in pushing up from a United goal-kick to play Kai Havertz onside and Trossard then stole in on the blind side of Casemiro to tap in the German's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe was in attendance at Old Trafford rather than at Wembley to see the club's women pick up their first ever major trophy in the FA Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The work that lies ahead of Ratcliffe has been laid bare in recent weeks, but the home side did manage to keep the majority of the 74,000 crowd onside by taking the game to Arsenal after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal, though, were rarely seriously troubled as they held out for a sixth clean sheet in their last seven away league games. (AFP)

    United crush Spurs to seize Women's FA Cup

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United won the Women's FA Cup for the first time with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Marc Skinner's side, who lost in last year's final to Chelsea, dominated the match and went ahead on the stroke of halftime through a stunning strike from midfielder Ella Toone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A header from Rachel Williams and two goals from Spanish forward Lucia Garcia after the break sealed the first major trophy for United since the team reformed in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wembley is always special. Last year we spoke as a group and said 'one day that will be ours' and today's the day so I'm buzzing," said goalkeeper Mary Earps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The atmosphere was buzzing on a sunny day at Wembley Stadium with 76,082 fans in attendance along with United's co-owner Avram Glazer and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the first half produced few chances of note until the second minute of stoppage time when England's Toone drove the ball forward and unleashed a powerful strike from outside the area into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spurs, playing in their first FA Cup final, drew 2-2 with United in the Women's Super League last month but struggled to create any attacking threat, not registering a single shot on target, and capitulated after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's Williams, who previously played for Spurs and won the FA Cup with Birmingham City 12 years ago, climbed high to head in a free kick before Garcia pounced on a poor pass from goalkeeper Becky Spencer to make it 3-0 in the 57th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garcia added another via a deflection in the 74th as United salvaged a season in which they have struggled, sitting fifth in the league standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't like to admit it but it does mask over the issues we've had," goalscorer Williams, 36, told the BBC. "We have had some ups and downs this year. That's for Marc (Skinner) and the backroom staff to be like 'right, this is what we have to do in the summer'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to have change things next year. We have had some injuries, three or four ACLs, at the start of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's football, teams go through transition. You have a good year, you have a dip. Next year we might just come back bigger, better and stronger and, who knows, we might just be lifting the league." (Reuters)

    Chiliean Alejandro Tabilo stuns Novak Djokovic

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic was knocked out of the Rome Open in the third round on Sunday by Alejandro Tabilo in a surprise 6-2, 6-3 defeat for the 24-time Grand Slam champion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic's bid for a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 title was ended in just over an hour by Chilean Tabilo, who is ranked 32nd in the world but was hugely impressive and claimed his first win over a top-10 opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old was eliminated two days after being accidentally being struck on the head by a bottle following his straightforward second-round win over Corentin Moutet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And his subdued performance on a court where he has won six titles suggested he may have still been suffering from that blow, even if he laughed it off by wearing a cycling crash helmet to practice on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic's early elimination is a blow for the last major tournament before Roland Garros later this month, which started without Italian world number two Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home fans have also been deprived of cheering on former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Musetti, while Djokovic's great clay-court rival Nadal, a big crowd favourite, was dumped out in the second round on Saturday by seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tabilo was a worthy winner after tearing into his superstar opponent, racing into a 4-0 lead in the first set in less than 20 minutes, breaking Djokovic twice and surprising the Serb with a series of impressive winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chilean claimed the opening set in half an hour, leaving fans sat under the baking Rome sunshine stunned at the off-form Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He immediately broke Djokovic for the third time in the opening game of the second set and went on to claim the biggest win of his career in remarkable style. (AFP)

    Nadal eyes French Open despite Rome exit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Rafael Nadal greets fans as he leaves the field after being defeated by Hubert Hurkacz during the Rome Open tennis tournament, in Italy. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752817_1_20240512092548.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal said on Saturday that he is leaning towards playing at the French Open despite his second-round elimination in Rome, as Novak Djokovic laughed off being hit by a bottle which briefly cast doubt on his continued participation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clay-court icon Nadal had previously said that he would only play at the French Open, where he has won a record 14 titles, if he feels competitive after a raft of injury problems over the last two years which have left him languishing 305th in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the manner of his elimination in his first ever encounter with Hubert Hurkacz - winner in straight sets 6-1, 6-3 - seemed a step backwards after reaching the last 16 in Madrid, leaving a question mark hanging over his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The decision, as you can imagine, is not clear in my mind today. But if I have to say what's my feeling and if my mind is closer one way or the other way, I am going to say to be in Roland Garros and try my best," Nadal told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Physically I have some issues, but not probably yet enough to say I'm not playing in the most important event of my tennis career. Let's see what's going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal held his own in the first two games in the first set, which took 26 minutes to complete, but then quickly fell away, Hurkacz winning without dropping a service game and seemingly without breaking a sweat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That level of dominance over Nadal on clay, much less a court where he has won a record 10 titles, would have been unimaginable a few short years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hurkacz will face Tomas Etcheverry in the third round after likely ending Nadal's love affair with Rome as the 22-time Grand Slam winner said that he was "98 percent" sure that he would never again grace the Roman clay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No-one will ever have a record like him on this surface. He's just bigger than the sport at the end of the day," said Hurkacz. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752804_1_20240512011419.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City hit the top of the Premier League with one week of the season remaining as two goals by Josko Gvardiol and one each for Phil Foden and Julian Alvarez sealed a 4-0 demolition of Fulham on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Burnley were relegated from the Premier League after a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur left Vincent Kompany's side five points from the safety zone with one game remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City's stroll in the London sunshine, their seventh successive league win and 16th consecutive victory over Fulham in all competitions, moved Pep Guardiola's a step closer an unprecedented fourth English title in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have 85 points from 36 games, with Arsenal on 83 from 36. Arsenal can regain top spot by beating Manchester United on Sunday but City, who play their game in hand at Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday, are now two wins away from history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the type of ruthless performance City inevitably produce down the stretch in title race and they now look likely to wrap up it up at home to West Ham United next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The great players enjoy playing with great pressure," Guardiola said. "These players in the last few years have been able to do it and we are again in the latter stages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Burnley, defeat in London meant a second relegation from the top flight in three seasons. The result also kept Spurs' slim hopes of qualifying for the Champions League alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In other action, a fine second half performance saw West Ham earn a 3-1 win against struggling Luton Town at the London Stadium while Yoane Wissa scored four minutes into added time to secure a 2-1 Premier League win for Brentford at Bournemouth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sean Longstaff's equaliser in first-half stoppage time earned Newcastle United a 1-1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion while Abdoulaye Doucoure scored a first-half winner as Everton beat relegated Sheffield United 1-0 at a balmy Goodison Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doucoure's headed goal was the 101st bottom side United have conceded this season, one more than the previous record set by Swindon Town in 1993-94 in what was then a 42-game campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton, who are in 15th place with 40 points from 37 matches, have now won five home Premier League games in a row without conceding a goal for the first time. (Reuters)

    England great Anderson calls time on cricket career

    <![CDATA[<img alt="James Anderson will bow out after a 21-year test career. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752802_1_20240511233930.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's James Anderson will retire from test cricket after the first match of the series against West Indies at Lord's this year, he said on Saturday, ending a 21-year career in which he became the most successful ever pace bowler.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 41-year-old has taken 700 test wickets, behind only Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan (800) and Australia's Shane Warne (708) on the all-time list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having made his debut for England at Lord's in 2003, Anderson will finish his illustrious career at the same ground his 188th test, two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been an incredible 20 years representing my country, playing the game I've loved since I was a kid. I'm going to miss walking out for England so much," Anderson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I know the time is right to step aside and let others realise their dreams just like I got to, because there is no greater feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed the "Burnley Express", Anderson did not say if he would continue playing county cricket for his club Lancashire who renamed the Pavilion End at Old Trafford as the James Anderson End.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm excited for the new challenges that lie ahead, as well as filling my days with even more golf," Anderson added. "Thank you to everyone who has supported me over the years, it's always meant a lot, even if my face often doesn't show it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's first match of a three-test series against the West Indies takes place from July 10-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Thompson, chair of the country's cricket board (ECB), said Anderson deserved a fitting send-off at the home of cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think we'll ever see a bowler to match Jimmy again," Thompson said. (Reuters)

 Kouta Watanabe struck six minutes from time to give Yokohama F Marinos a 2-1 win over Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates in the first leg of the Asian Champions League final on Saturday, earning Harry Kewell's a slender advantage ahead of the return.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mohammed Abbas put Al-Ain in front after 12 minutes when he reacted quickest to a rebound after Soufiane Rahimi's shot was saved by Marinos goalkeeper William Popp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese side pulled level with 18 minutes remaining after Yan Matheus cut in from the right to deliver a curling cross that Asahi Uenaka headed beyond Khalid Eisa to leave the tie delicately poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watanabe grabbed the winner when he slotted in from close range after Ryo Miyaichi redirected Matheus' centre into his path, with the goal given after a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The teams meet again in the UAE on May 25 with the winners taking Asia's last remaining berth at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States next year. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French soccer star Kylian Mbappe said in a video on social media platform X on Friday that he would leave Paris Saint Germain and end his 'adventure' with the club in a few weeks time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is my last year at Paris Saint Germain. I will not stay on and I will end my adventure in a few weeks time. I will play my last match at the Parc des Princes this Sunday," said the 25-year old in his video address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been widespread media speculation that Mbappe will move to Real Madrid. Mbappe did not mention the Spanish champions in his video but confirmed he would leave France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's hard, it's hard. I did not think it would be as hard as it was to announce this, to leave my country, Ligue 1 – a championship which I have always known. But I think I needed this, the need for a new challenge after this year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Borussia Dortmund beat PSG in the Champions League semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar's state-run Qatar Sports Investment firm bought a majority stake in PSG in 2011.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, PSG have won nine Ligue 1 titles, but it has failed to win the Champions League – a key goal for its Qatari owners. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell tossed in a game-high 29 points and the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers pulled even in the Eastern Conference second round by beating the Boston Celtics 118-94 in Game 2 on Thursday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mitchell had six points at halftime, but scored 16 in the third quarter and seven in the fourth. He was 10 of 19 from the field, including 5 of 7 from 3-point territory. Mitchell tossed in a game-high 33 points when Boston earned a 120-95 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland led by 12 after three quarters, and pushed the lead to 25 after a Caris LeVert three-point play with 4:58 remaining. Boston coach Joe Mazzulla pulled his starters off the court at that point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite being in foul trouble for much of the second half, Cleveland's Evan Mobley had 21 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. LeVert [21], Darius Garland [14], Isaac Okoro [12] and Max Strus [12] also scored in double figures for the Cavaliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum had 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists for the Celtics, who shot 8 of 35 from 3-point territory. Jaylen Brown added 19 points for Boston, but was 0 for 6 on 3-pointers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The series will shift to Cleveland for Game 3 on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleveland center Jarrett Allen missed his fifth straight game with a rib injury. The Celtics were without center Kristaps Porzingis, who has missed the last three games because of a right calf injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics led by nine early, but Cleveland had a nine-point lead, 30-21, after LeVert capped an 11-0 run by making a layup with 58.3 remaining in the first quarter. The Cavaliers had a 30-24 edge after 12 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston owned an eight-point lead late in the second quarter, but Cleveland closed the quarter on an 11-3 run to tie it at 54 at halftime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cavaliers outscored the Celtics 36-24 in the third and had a 90-78 lead when Mitchell made a 3-pointer that just beat the buzzer at the end of the quarter. (Reuters)

 Leverkusen reach Europa League final after Roma draw extends unbeaten run
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bayer Leverkusen staged a stunning late comeback to move into the Europa League final with a 2-2 draw at home against AS Roma on Thursday as they won 4-2 on aggregate and set the longest unbeaten run in all competitions including European matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bundesliga champions Leverkusen, who have also reached this month's German Cup final as they chase a treble, played their 49th match without defeat to surpass Benfica's record set from 1963–65 but they had to battle for the second leg draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xabi Alonso's side, who have 40 wins in their unbeaten run, will face Italian side Atalanta in the May 22 final in Dublin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be a third European final for Leverkusen, who won their only continental title when they lifted the UEFA Cup in 1988 and lost in the 2002 Champions League showpiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roma knew they had a mountain to climb after losing the first leg 2-0 at home but they remained composed in an evenly contested match in which Leverkusen gradually seized control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen's Exequiel Palacios struck the post just before halftime, with the rebound deflecting off Roma goalkeeper Mile Svilar's back, but Evan Ndicka cleared the danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Svilar then made another acrobatic save just before the break, denying Amine Adli and then blocking the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Leverkusen's pressure Roma took the lead with a penalty from Leandro Paredes just before halftime after Jonathan Tah fouled Sardar Azmoun. Paredes scored with another spot kick in the 66th minute after Adam Hlozek handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With eight minutes remaining, a Leverkusen corner confused the visiting defence, including the until then excellent Svilar, leading to defender Gianluca Mancini inadvertently deflecting the ball into his own net at the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late substitute Joseph Stanisic then secured Leverkusen's place in the record books deep into stoppage time with the equaliser after a skilful move into the box to delight the ecstatic home fans and leave battling Roma distraught. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal battled into the second round of the Rome Open on Thursday after bouncing back from a set down to beat qualifier Zizou Bergs 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clay court icon Nadal will face world number nine Hubert Hurkacz next as he continued his comeback from injury with a punishing match against his Belgian opponent which lasted nearly three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Nadal's side of the draw are last year's winner, world number four Daniil Medvedev, and the beaten finalist Holger Rune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal has in recent times been a shadow of the player who has won 22 Grand Slams in a storied career which has also brought a record 10 titles in Rome, his most recent in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old has struggled with injury, dropping down to 305 in the world rankings after missing almost all of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned in April from another three-month lay-off with a second-round exit in Barcelona before reaching the last 16 in Madrid last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He showed glimpses of his old self against Bergs who is ranked 108 in the world and is an eight-time title winner on the Challenger tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outsider Bergs, 24, had in previous tournaments taken sets off high-profile players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's losing Rome finalist Holger Rune, and he pushed his illustrious rival all the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big-hitting Belgian briefly looked like he might win the biggest match of his career to date before Nadal fought back to take a hard-fought victory. (AFP)

    Battling Brunson fires Knicks over Pacers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brunson celebrates in the fourth quarter after scoring against the Pacers. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752421_1_20240509114855.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana exploited Brunson's absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm's length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana's scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lo Wai-fung has made history by becoming the territory's first taekwondo athlete to make the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He's headed to Paris this summer in the under 68kg class because an opponent he lost to in a qualifying tournament in March was disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Taekwondo Association said originally, only the two athletes who made the final of the Asian qualifier would reach the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lo, 22, is now taking the spot because Ali Reza Abbasi from the Refugee Olympic Team was deemed ineligible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the male and female tournaments have four weight categories, with 16 fighters in each weight class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic taekwondo competition begins on August 7.

    Nuggets' Jokic scoops third NBA MVP award

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jokic's 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league this season. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752405_1_20240509100327.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic was named NBA Most valuable Player for the third time in four seasons on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Serbian star, who won the award in 2021 and 2022, finished runner-up in the voting in 2023 but had the satisfaction of leading the Nuggets to a first NBA title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season he averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists in the regular season and beat out Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks in final voting for the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became the second player, after Oscar Robertson, to record 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 600 assists in a season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 25 triple-doubles and 68 double-doubles were both second in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic enters elite territory with a third MVP crown. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six MVPs are the most ever. Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won five apiece and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic joins Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as three-time winners after earning 79 first-placed votes compared to 15 for Gilgeous-Alexander and four for Doncic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Behind Jokic, the 57-25 Nuggets matched the franchise high for victories in a season – although they were tied for best record in the West with Oklahoma City and ended up with the second seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether Jokic will be able to combine an MVP award and the title this season remains to be seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nuggets dropped the first two games of their Western Conference semi-final series to the Minnesota Timberwolves and face the tough task of trying to claw back on the Timberwolves' home court starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokic's victory marks the sixth straight season that the MVP award has gone to a player born outside the United States. The last US-born player to win was James Harden in 2018. (AFP)
