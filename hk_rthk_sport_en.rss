<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great joy that we received this news," Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, said. "Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five women representing 34 countries and regions will kick off the contest at 2pm Hong Kong time, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Jason Ng will participate in the men's event, which begins at 4.45pm, immediately after the women's race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The results of the latest water analyses...have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place," Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris has spent US$1.52 billion of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill. (Reuters)

    Wong Ka-lee tells judokas Olympics not a pipe dream

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wong Ka-lee says she wants to show young judokas that it's possible to reach the Olympics. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763678_1_20240731090156.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Olympian Wong Ka-lee said she hopes her journey to Paris will inspire other young judokas to pursue their dreams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was the third judoka ever from Hong Kong to qualify for the Olympics, marking the return of a local judoka to the Games after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was eliminated in the women’s under 48kg competition by Austrian Katharina Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Wong believes her presence in the Olympics would show others that they too can make it to the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Younger [athletes] may think the Olympics are out of reach. But going to the Olympics this time can show them that it’s not. They can all do it,” she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete said her judo journey is far from over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics are a good experience. I see that I have obviously improved this year in terms of throwing techniques. I hope I can perform better in the next competition,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-time Olympian said she will stay in Paris to watch the matches of top judokas and visit wineries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said she will continue to sharpen her skills, and her next goal is the Asian Judo Open Hong Kong which starts in November.

 There was plenty of action at the Olympics in Paris with Siobhan Haughey qualifying as the top seed in the final of the women's 100m freestyle.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Siobhan Haughey is heading into the women’s 100m freestyle showdown as the favourite, after qualifying the fastest out of the 16 swimmers in the semi-finals at La Defense Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey, who notched a silver in Tokyo, clocked 52.64 seconds, 0.08 seconds ahead of Australia’s Shayna Jack in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old SAR star was only fourth at the halfway mark, but moved past her rivals with a late charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Yang Junxuan also punched her final ticket alongside world recorder holder Sarah Sjoestroem, but Wu Qingfeng barely missed out on a spot after finishing ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the pool, China's Pan Zhanle also qualified fastest in the men's 100m freestyle semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world and Olympic record holder will go up against Australia's Kyle Chalmers, the 2016 champion who set a time of 47.58 seconds, 0.37 seconds slower than Yang.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States reclaimed the women's gymnastics team gold in dominant fashion on Tuesday, while Simone Biles took centre stage again with a captivating performance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biles, together with teammates Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Sunisa Lee, led wire-to-wire. They finished with a score of 171.296, 5.802 more than silver medallists Italy, while Brazil rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, winners at the 2008 Beijing Games, finished a disappointing sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a shocking withdrawal from the team event in Tokyo, Biles has cemented her status as the world's most decorated gymnast by clinching her fifth Olympic gold, and eighth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Americans already had gold in the bag when Biles brought the Bercy Arena crowd to their feet with a gravity-defying floor routine that featured two of her signature skills - a double back flip with a half twist and the "triple-double" of two back flips with three twists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-seven-year-old Biles is set to add more medals to her cabinet after qualifying to four individual events in Paris. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu made a winning start in his maiden Olympic appearance, beating Mexico's Luis Ramon Garrido in the group stage of the men's singles tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee, the world number 17 who missed out on a spot for the Tokyo Games in 2021, overpowered his opponent 21-5 in the first game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 66th-ranked Garrido, who was also making his Olympic debut in Paris, took the ensuing game 21-15 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair exchanged leads in a nail-biting finale, but Lee eventually came out on top after pulling away late on to win 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top men's shuttler from the SAR next faces Chou Tien-chien of Chinese Taipei Wednesday evening, Hong Kong time. The winner of that match will advance to the round of 16, as Chou had already beaten Garrido earlier in their group tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a different story for another local badminton player, Happy Lo, who ended her Olympic journey after losing her second straight group match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supanida Katethong of Thailand beat Lo 21-14, 21-9.

 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China said it respects the decision of the referees in a controversy involving fencer Edgar Cheung's win over his Italian opponent in the individual foil final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The Olympic Games are the highest-level events in the world. As always, the SF&OC and athletes adhere to and firmly believe in the Olympic spirit, respecting all game results and referee decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian Fencing Federation earlier lodged a complaint against what it called “unacceptable refereeing decisions” in Cheung's 15-14 win over Fillippo Macchi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President of the federation, Paolo Azzi, said he was disappointed with the conclusion the match, adding that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been robbed of the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were two occasions where both fencers landed their touches, but the referees from Chinese Taipei and South Korea ruled that no point should be awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macchi wrote in his Instagram post that he didn’t want to blame the referees for his defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that for sure the refereeing could have been better. It's impossible to not call three touches but at the end of the day that's the nature of the competition," Nicola Lu, epee coach of SAR fencer Cedric Ho, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have external factors that we cannot control and we can only focus on doing our best and focusing on our own actions,” Lu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case also sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian netizens on the social media platforms of the two fencers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, felt it was unlikely that Cheung will be stripped of his gold due to Italy's appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don’t think it will affect [the result] because the referees were very careful. They made the judgement after watching video replays many times. Even when you ask [other] people to review the play, it will still be the same result," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that the referees must decide responsibly when it’s hard to tell who wins or loses, adding that it’s normal for people to have different interpretations.

 Chinese pair Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha captured the gold medal for the table tennis mixed doubles event at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday, after defeating Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong of North Korea 4-2 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded Chinese duo, who won the 2021 and 2023 World championships, beat their North Korean opponents 11-6, 7-11, 11-8, 11-5, 7-11 and 11-8 at the South Paris Arena 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, North Korea said they could learn from China after winning their first Olympic medal in eight years on Tuesday in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For China, it was their first Olympic gold medal in the table tennis mixed doubles, after the event made its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020, where Japanese pair Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito won the gold in a Japan-China final on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal was won by South Korean paddlers Lim Jong-hoon and Shin Yu-bin who beat Wong Chun-ting and Doo Hoi-kem from Hong Kong, China 4-0 earlier in the day. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting fought hard in the bronze-medal match of the mixed doubles table tennis event at the Paris Olympics, but they weren’t able to make it to the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team on Tuesday lost 0-4 to South Korea’s Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon in a match lasting 39 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean pair were off to a quick start, winning the first game 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then raced to a 3-0 lead, taking the second and third games 11-7, 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong pushed hard to catch up in a nail-biting fourth game, but it eventually went to Shin and Lim, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although we missed the medal by a small margin, the fact that we got into the top four this time is already a big breakthrough," Doo said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because actually there were a lot of teams before whose ability were better or similar to ours. Including the semi-finals, we really did keep trying to become better. Even though the ending was not the best, we did try our best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the defeat, it's the best finish for Hong Kong in mixed doubles table tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it's a bit of a pity, especially since we had a chance to get a medal both today and yesterday," Wong said. "Although we are not very satisfied with our performance today, we were already thinking hard and communicating with each other about any strategy we can have before the match."

    Gauff crashes out of Paris Olympics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gauff talks with an official during her match against Croatia's Donna Vekic. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763919_1_20240730203828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff was left in tears after getting into an extended argument with the chair umpire over a ruling during the reigning U.S. Open champion's 7-6 (7), 6-2 loss to Donna Vekic of Croatia in a Paris Olympics third-round singles match Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number two Gauff claimed she was "getting cheated" over a line call in the sixth game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff hit a serve and Vekic's return landed near the baseline. A line judge initially called Vekic's shot out; Gauff did not keep the ball in play. Chair umpire Jaume Campistol thought Vekic's shot landed in and awarded her the point, giving her a service break and a 4-2 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She then walked over to talk to the official, and play was delayed for several minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never argue these calls. But he called it out before I hit the ball," Gauff said to Campistol. “It’s not even a perception; it's the rules. I always have to advocate for myself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff, a 20-year-old from Florida, was seeded second in Paris and easily won her first two singles matches, dropping a total of just five games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her first Olympic singles tournament – she is still in women's doubles and mixed doubles – ended with a performance that was hardly her best on the hottest day of the Summer Games so far, with the heat rising above 32 degrees celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before the trouble over the umpiring decision, Gauff could not sustain a good start against Vekic, who was a semifinalist at Wimbledon this month. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimmer Ian Ho has been eliminated from the men’s 100m freestyle event on Tuesday at the Olympic Games, finishing 55th overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is competing for the second time at the Games, finished sixth in his heat with a time of 51.46 seconds, 2.62 seconds behind the heat 5 winner Lamar Taylor of the Bahamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's definitely a different experience, but it's a little more familiar, so I'm glad I can be here again,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself. Swimming is a sport where you can focus on yourself and do the best race that you can, and that's what I've tried to do over the past couple of days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Alexy of the United States led all 79 swimmers with a time of 47.57 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only the 16 fastest from the heats qualify for the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho will also compete in the men’s 50m freestyle in Paris.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have failed to advance in the women's doubles in badminton at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their final group match on Tuesday, the SAR duo lost to Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first game was a closely fought affair before the No 4 seed from China prevailed, 21-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second game was also close with the score tied several times early on, before Liu and Tan put on a late charge to come away 21-15 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did well because we didn't fear them for their ranking. Even when we were trailing by many points during the match, we absolutely didn't give up and we tried to fight point by point," Lianne Yeung said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair finished in third place in Group B with one win and two losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the group and Bulgaria came second, both advancing to the next round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A sports psychologist says the Olympic Games highlight how athletes need to work on their mental state if they want to perform well, and not just their physical fitness and sporting skill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Karen Lo, whose clients include SAR Olympic athletes, on Tuesday said athletes need the mental discipline to maintain composure and focus, even when things aren't going their way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to remain calm and focused when you're losing, and also even when you're leading by a couple of points because you want to continue to lead as well. These are skills that are not so related to your fitness level, or physique, or your strategy and tactics. This is more on the mental side of the game," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that athletes may face extra pressures, such as performance anxiety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Athletes are human beings, they struggle with their mental health just like anyone else in Hong Kong. However, their identity is an athlete, they might feel extremely nervous handling expectations from the local community, and also coaches, that might be unique from everyone else," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that athletes can make use of psychological workshops and sessions to identify the underlying reasons for any confidence issues.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun's hopes of capturing a medal at the Paris Olympics came to an end on Tuesday, after he finished last among six competitors in the first quarter-final of the men's rowing single sculls event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clocked in a time of seven minutes 13.7 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew I was competing against seeded players in the quarter-finals, so I tried to catch up with them in the first 500 metres," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it would be challenging, but I didn't want to give up. The process was difficult and I had only myself, from preparing for the match to drawing up a race plan."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will row again in the C and D semi-finals on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World Triathlon on Tuesday said the Paris Olympics men's triathlon event will be postponed by a day, after tests showed the water quality in the River Seine was not up to standard.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The development means Hong Kong's Jason Ng is now scheduled to compete on Wednesday at 4.45pm. He was originally going to race at 2pm on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tests carried out in the Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held," World Triathlon said in a statement, adding the International Olympic Committee, Meteo France and Paris officials were involved in conducting the water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, meteorological events beyond our control, such as the rain which fell over Paris on 26 and 27 July, can alter water quality and compel us to reschedule the event for health reasons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's triathlon event will also take place on Wednesday, with World Triathlon saying both events are subject to future water tests.

  A Paris based hydrologist had earlier told RTHK that rainstorms in the 24 hours before a swimming event in the Seine could wash storm water off the land surfaces around the city, bringing pollution with it.

 It was another action packed day on Monday at the Olympics in Paris with Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung making history for Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung distinguished himself with the successful defence of his Olympic title in the men's individual foil while Haughey won a consecutive medal in the 200 free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China now ranks tenth in the medals table with China third in the tally with five golds thanks to efforts from their divers and shooters. Japan top the table ahead of hosts France.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king Edgar Cheung defended his Olympic gold medal in men's foil in dramatic fashion after making a brilliant comeback in the final match against Italian Filippo Macchi in the early hours of Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian pulled ahead 14-12, but Cheung immediately gained two points to bring the game into a tie-breaker for the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the score tied at 14-14, the fencing got even more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On two occasions, both fencers thought they had won the last point, but the judges said it was too close to rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After three attempts to break the tie, Cheung took home the win for Hong Kong, China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he couldn't believe he's the first athlete to repeat in men's foil in 68 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe [that I've won]...and being the first man to repeat in so long, actually, I really rather can't believe it," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of the best moments in my life. To have a gold medal in France, with a French coach, for me it's a wonderful day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he woke up not feeling too good, but when he fenced, it was different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said coach Greg Koenig told him not to focus on the judges' decisions late in the game, and focus on the next move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach, for his part, said he never doubted that Cheung could overcome his deficit at 12-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three last points, to be honest, I know he can do it. I will stay positive. I will send him my maximum positive energy because I know, three points in a row for him is absolutely nothing," Koenig said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory helped him claim his second gold in as many Games and becomes the first athlete from the SAR to grab consecutive Olympic titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong now has two gold medals in Paris, both in fencing, the most ever won at a single Games so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, the Italian Fencing Federation has lodged an official complaint with the International Fencing Federation and the International Olympic Committee over what it considers to be unacceptable refereeing decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation President Paolo Azzi expressed his disappointment at the conclusion of the competition, claiming that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been unfairly denied the gold medal he deserved.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey won a consecutive medal in the women's 200m freestyle, earning bronze on top of the silver she won in Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong star was among the first to turn at the half-way point before her Australian rivals Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus turned up the heat in the second 100 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Callaghan pulled away from Titmus and Haughey in the last lap to win in an Olympic record time of 1 minute, 53.27 seconds, 0.54 seconds ahead of defending champion Titmus who settled for silver while Haughey picked up the bronze in a time of 1 minute, 54.55.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said after the race that her time wasn't as good as she thought it would be, but she's still satisfied with the result, saying the Australian swimmers were really strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said it was a special moment for her because when she won silvers in Tokyo, there were no spectators because of Covid, and she's glad that her parents were among many in the crowd cheering her on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star swimmer also thanked Hongkongers for staying up to support her and other SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you so much for everyone who's been waking up really early to watch our races, our matches and competitions," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really been on social media a lot these past few days, but I've received everyone's messages and all the love and support, so, thank you so much and please keep supporting us because it means the world to us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Haughey's third Olympic medal following the two silvers she won in the 100m and 200m freestyle events at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is due to compete in the women's 100m free on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Summer McIntosh set the pool alight at La Defense Arena in Paris, with a commanding victory in the women's 400m individual medley.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Canadian won in a time of 4 minutes, 27.71 seconds, ahead of American silver medallist Katie Grimes and her bronze-winning US teammate Emma Weyant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh's triumph comes two days after taking silver behind Australian powerhouse Ariarne Titmus in the 400m freestyle on the meet's opening on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, the men's 200m freestyle a closely fought battle between at least six swimmers in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, it was Romanian teenager David Popovici who powered to the gold medal on Monday, edging Britain's Matthew Richards by a fingertip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old touched in 1 minute 44.72 seconds ahead of Richards who took silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Luke Hobson took bronze in a frantic finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was Popovici's first Olympic medal after missing out in Tokyo where he came fourth and he also became the first Romanian male to win an Olympic gold in swimming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another gold for Italy as world record holder Thomas Ceccon won the men's 100m backstroke gold at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Xu Jiayu took silver, with 2016 gold medallist Ryan Murphy of the US taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also won silver in the women's 100m breaststroke as Tang Qianting finished just behind Tatjana Smith of South Africa who added the 100 breast title to the 200m gold she won in Tokyo three years ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese men's gymnastic team took home silver at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Tuesday, as two falls from one of the gymnasts in the final round proved to be too costly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japan took gold on 259.594 points, a little more than half a point ahead of China. The United States got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China led by more than three points heading into the final round, with Xiao Ruoteng, Su Weide and Zhang Boheng up on the horizontal bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su slipped and lost his grip on the bar twice in his routine, for a subpar score of 11.6. Zhang was unable to make up for the deficit in the last routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China had taken the lead after the first three rotations, with exceptional performances on the rings, led by Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Liu Yang, and strong scores on the horse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan and Zhang then extended the advantage with slick moves on the parallel bars, with Zou getting 16 points on the apparatus, the highest individual score in the entire event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su had a night to forget as his slips also meant the chance at gold faded away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese themselves had to overcome a poor start to the competition to capture gold in the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China snatched bronzes in the same event at both the Tokyo and Rio Olympics.

  “He really could control his emotions. He showed real maturity in his fencing. Whatever the score was, he was really focused so it was amazing,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We still have one more match. We came here for the gold and we will give the maximum for the gold.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be the second fencing medal for Hong Kong, China, given Cheung is guaranteed at least a silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also means Cheung becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to have a chance at defending their Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If he wins, Cheung would be the first man to defend an Olympic foil title since 1956.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will face Italian Filippo Macchi in the final at 4.10am Hong Kong time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s windsurfers were finally able to make some waves in the south of France, with Mui Ma ranking fourth after finishing her first day of Olympic races.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma finished sixth and fifth in her two races respectively. There are five races in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her fellow windsurfer Alex Cheng ranked 20th after his first race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR’s skiff sailors, Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth, remained in second to last place after completing half of their races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The windsurfing competitions were postponed for a day due to a lack of wind down in Marseilles.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis stars Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting will play for a mixed doubles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, after losing to North Korea's pair 3-4 in the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an up and down match, with Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong, the lowest seed in this tournament, starting with a bang and taking the first game 3-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong then took the second game 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth-seeded Hong Kong pair then had a 2-1 edge after winning the third game 11-3. But they dropped the next two, 9-11, 9-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall at the South Paris Arena, Doo and Wong went on to win the sixth game 11-9 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's when the North Koreans went on the attack, as they jumped out to a 7-0 lead behind Ri's strong forehand smashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair fought their way back to make it 6-9, before eventually dropping the final game 6-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Korean giant killers had started the tournament defeating the world number two pair, Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan, in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo will face South Korea's Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon, who lost to China's top-seeded Sun Yingsha and Wang Chuqin in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, Wong said they gave it their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Facing these North Koreans, they're the so-called dark horses. But any team in the final four has to be very good. So actually, when we faced them, we felt we were the dark horses," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So on the table, we fought until the very end, but we failed. We will collect ourselves for the bronze medal match and hopefully we can win a medal for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal match will take place on Tuesday at 7:30pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung overcame a partisan home crowd to edge out Enzo Lefort of France for a place in the semi-finals of the men’s individual foil on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lefort took control in the opening stages, with Cheung ending the first round down 3-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete was able to turn it around early in the second round, but the French fencer fought back, leading to a nail-biting back and forth that ended with the second round score at 13-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, knowing he would go out if he lost another point, scored two quick points in an intense final round to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, taking Hong Kong, China into the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When you fence against a guy who is a two-time world champion, who is playing in his hometown with all the public, of course it’s going to be hard, harder than usual but Ka-long found the psychological resources to put the last point, which is amazing regarding to the match, so I am very, very again proud of what he did,” said coach Gregory Koenig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to understand that even when you are tired, you have enough adrenaline to find the resources. You are tired but the psychological is the most important at this point. Even when you have pain everywhere, you have to think ‘OK I have pain, but this is life, this is how it is, I have to do what I know what to do’ and that is what he did in the last two points. The last two points were amazing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Koenig added that his next opponent Kazuki Iimura of Japan would definitely be a challenge, saying the Japanese fencer might be shorter than Cheung, but he moves very quickly.

    Djokovic downs Nadal in Olympic blockbuster

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Djokovic and Nadal of Spain embrace after their match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763742_1_20240729223953.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic crushed Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in their blockbuster Olympics clash on Monday as the two titans met for the 60th and possibly final time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The showdown between the two most successful men's tennis players in history appeared to be fizzling out before a late fightback from Nadal enabled him to avoid his heaviest-ever defeat by Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very relieved," said Djokovic. "Everything was going my way, I was 6-1, 4-0 up but I played a sloppy service game and gave him chances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic's 31st win in a rivalry that began on the same Roland Garros clay courts in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb added: "I never thought back in 2006 that we'd still be playing each other almost 20 years later."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal admitted Djokovic was the "clear favourite" ahead of their first clash in more than two years, with the Spaniard a shadow of the player who reigned for the best part of two decades at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 14 of Nadal's 22 Grand Slams have come in Paris, the 38-year-old has been plagued by injuries in recent years and he has slumped to 161st in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His participation in the singles in Paris had been in doubt until the last minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic has not had a good season by his stratospherically high standards but the 37-year-old Serbian rose to the occasion in his pursuit of an elusive Olympic gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed raced into a 5-0 lead before Nadal finally got on the board but Djokovic closed out the set and surged 4-0 ahead in the second before Nadal offered some belated resistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal clawed his way back to 4-4 only for Djokovic to break once more, this time making no mistake as he put away his old foe and perhaps brought down the curtain on one of the greatest rivalries in the history of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a bronze medallist on his Olympic debut in 2008, goes on to face Matteo Arnaldi or Dominik Koepfer for a spot in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will turn his focus to the doubles where he is in a dream-team pairing with compatriot Carlos Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the reigning men's French Open and Wimbledon champion, takes on Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor later Monday in the singles. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung advanced to the quarter-finals on Monday, after beating Mo Ziwei of China 15-10 in the last-16 of the men’s individual foil at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is ranked third in the world, started out strong earning himself an early three points to put him ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo was able to fight back, but Cheung maintained good defence to put him at an 8-6 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mo then bounced back into the action, but he couldn’t overtake the SAR star, who won in two rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will play host France’s Enzo Lefort in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gregory Koenig said Cheung has to be prepared to face Lefort and a strong home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He has really the perfect mindset. He is self-confident, he knows he can be strong and this is what I want from him. Now as you can see on the table, he will have to fence Enzo Lefort, which is really the ‘chouchou’ of the French public, so it’s going to be hard,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be like in Rio against the Brazilian guy. He has to face off. If you want to become an Olympic champion, you have to face these kind of matches where you have to fence against one guy plus five thousand people of the public, but he will be prepared for this.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Monday flocked to shopping malls and government facilities to watch Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and other SAR athletes in action.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people were at a shopping mall in Kwun Tong to watch the live-stream of the Games on a giant screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the spectators was Valerie, who was there with her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really exciting, because there are people cheering when the athletes won or scored a point. I think this is really different (from) watching at home," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another spectator, Ena, said she was there to cheer on all the Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, their performance has been really motivational to all the Hong Kong citizens. Just wonderful to see more Hong Kong people step into the Olympics, like be the Olympians, and participate in such a big event," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, who was watching Cheung's bouts, said he was moved by the perseverance of the home-grown athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they are so hardworking. They put a lot of efforts on it. We should really support them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and star swimmer Siobhan Haughey are among those in action on day three of the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Sheng Lihao claimed the Paris Olympic title in the men's 10m air rifle event on Monday, adding to his victory in the 10m air rifle mixed team event along with Huang Yuting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sheng, the silver medalist from Tokyo, set an Olympic record with a score of 252.2 points at the Chateauroux Shooting Center.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm quite satisfied with my performance at the Paris Olympics. As you could see, I encountered some difficulties during the competitions, but I managed to hold myself together and complete them," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lindgren of Sweden claimed silver with 251.4 points. He came from behind to eliminate Miran Maricic of Croatia by 0.5 points through the second shot of the penultimate series, scoring 10.6 to Maricic's 9.9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite finishing first in Sunday's qualification round, the 19-year-old Sheng was not at his best, scoring 631.7 points, which is 6.2 points lower than his own world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he responded with a strong start in the final and dominated after three series in the elimination stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two perfect 10.9 shots gave him a 2-point advantage over second-placed Arjun Babuta of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Sheng's lead diminished to 0.6 points before the final series against Lindgren due to two sub-10 shots, he managed a 10.5 and a 10.6 to secure victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the third shooting gold for China at Paris 2024 from five events, and the country's fifth gold overall. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Edgar Cheung on Monday easily booked his spot in the last 16 of men’s foil individual event at the Grand Palais in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer beat Daniel Gu of Canada 15-5 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung went ahead by seven points before his Canadian opponent started striking back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he could not narrow the deficit and Cheung went on to win in the opening three-minute period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This was the plan. We knew this opponent is a strong opponent but I knew if Cheung Ka-long is at his level, he can defeat easily and this was the plan,” said Cheung's coach Gregory Koenig after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will take on China's Mo Zewei next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I really wanted Ka-long to keep focus, to stay focus on every point even if the score was very high difference, to keep focusing, to keep fighting to be fully prepared for the next match, which is going to be to very tough against Mo Ziwei,” Koenig added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gu said he treasured the opportunity to take on an Olympic champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is no point being mad or upset about it. I already knew going into this, I am not a favourite to win, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like to get beat by someone that good,” said Gu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was fun. It is always a learning experience so all the hits and points he gets on me, there is a reason why he is an Olympic champion.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two SAR table tennis players, Wong Chun-ting and Zhu Chengzhu, on Monday won their singles matches at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw, Wong beat Ibrahima Diaw of Senegal in a nail-biter in a round of 64 match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair split the first six games, including a marathon second game lasting 14 minutes in favour of Wong, 18-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong prevailed in the seventh and deciding game, 11-4, to make it through to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, I feel satisfied with my performance today," he said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it was tough, but there were also some surprises... My opponent was in form quickly and acted more decisively, creating a lot of big difficulties for me. So it’s a good thing that I quickly adjusted my game, and luckily I won the second game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Zhu's victory in her round of 64 match was a more straight-forward affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She swept Chien Tung-chuan of Chinese Taipei 11-7, 11-7, 11-7, 12-10.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Cindy Cheung was on Monday eliminated in the first round of women’s 100m backstroke in the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She finished fifth in her heat at the Paris La Defense Arena in 1 min 3.45 secs, which put her 29th among 36 contestants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fastest 16 swimmers qualify for the semifinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff and Regan Smith from the United States and Australian Kaylee McKeown are in the top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though the time isn't the most satisfactory, I will still say it's a great opportunity, and I'm just grateful that I get to finally say that I've competed in the Olympics," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of performance, and may be like handling the nerves, I think there's still much to improve on, that I can learn from other more experienced swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yeah, I'm just here as a learning experience and to enjoy my time here."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A chief surgeon who performed two knee operations on Hong Kong fencing champion Vivian Kong says her Olympic success demonstrates her resilience and determination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Patrick Yung, who chairs the department of orthopaedics and traumatology at Chinese University, said he was moved to see Kong claim a gold medal in Paris at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's moving and touching. Indeed, I witnessed Vivian over the past seven to eight years overcoming all those big and small injuries," he told RTHK in an interview in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After all these years, [going] through all the injuries, all the different setbacks, she champions in the biggest stages in the sports world.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong’s journey to Olympic gold has been filled with ups and downs, after she suffered serious anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung recalled seeing in the newspaper Kong’s return to action just three months after her surgery in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “She didn't tell me, so I called her up and said ‘How come you get back so soon?’ and then she just said 'hehe' and 'Well, I'm okay,' but since then I understand that this girl is very disciplined. She recovers very fast.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung, a long-time honorary medical doctor for the Hong Kong Sports Institute, said Kong’s recovery was exceptionally fast thanks to her unwavering discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have operated on thousands of ACLs, but she's probably the one who got the fastest recovery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, Kong withdrew from the Asian Fencing Championships because of another knee injury. But she recovered in less than a month to defeat Auriane Mallo-Breton in dramatic fashion in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In about a month's time, most people would be okay to walk around with that injury. But if we are talking about competing in the highest level of the sports arena, it's very much demanding. Again she performs another magic,” Yung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago. The top épéeist is the third Hong Kong gold medallist in history, following windsurfer Lee Lai-shan and fellow fencer Edgar Cheung.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey made it to the women’s 200m freestyle final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first 100 metres, Haughey maintained a steady top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to narrow the gap and finished third in the second semi-final of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 minute, 55.51 seconds was the fourth fastest overall, earning her one of eight spots in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final will take place in the early hours of Tuesday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey’s main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday, and Ariarne Titmus, who holds the world and Olympic records in the event and defended her title in the 400m free on the first day of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m free at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago and won the world title in the 200 freestyle earlier this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Adam Peaty was denied in his bid to became the first person to win three consecutive 100m breaststroke titles at the Olympic Games, finishing joint second with America's Nick Fink in a time of 59.05 seconds at La Defense Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Top honours went to Italy's Nicolo Martinenghi who was only 0.02 seconds faster than the Brit and American in a relatively slow final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the second night of swimming got off to a great start for hosts France as swim star Leon Marchand dominated the field in the men's 400m individual medley to win in a new Olympic record time of 4 minutes, 02.95 seconds, just shy of his world mark of 4 minutes, 02.50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marchand was ahead as soon as his head popped from the water and he steadily pulled away from the field in what was essentially two separate races: Marchand racing the clock and everyone else competing for silver and bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The silver went to Japan's Tomoyuki Matsushita, who finished nearly 6 seconds behind the winner in 4 minutes, 08.62 seconds. American Carson Foster claimed the bronze a fraction of a second behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was crazy. I think I will remember this one for a very long time," said Marchand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The emotions are very difficult to describe. It was incredible for a swimmer. I opened my eyes, listened to everything that was happening around. And that really pushed me to already have a great race and have a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, it was a US one-two in the women's 100 metres butterfly as Torri Huske stunned her American teammate and world-record holder Gretchen Walsh to clinch the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walsh turned first, but Huske came home strongly to touch in 55.59 seconds, with Walsh second in 55.63 and China's Zhang Yufei taking bronze in 56.21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't really remember my race that much. My first 50 felt good, and then I've been really working on my second 50 a lot, especially after last year," said Huske.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian defending champion Maggie Mac Neil finished fifth and Australia's Emma McKeon, the queen of the pool in Tokyo with seven medals, came sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In semi-final action, China's Tang Qianting is ranked fourth going into the women's 100m breaststroke final later on Monday while Yang Junxuan is fifth seed going into the women's 200 free. On the men's side, Xu Jiayu qualified first in the 100m backstroke. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's badminton pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have staved off elimination from the Paris Olympics, after beating their American counterparts in a grueling match in the early hours of Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR shuttlers recovered a day after losing their opener against a pair from Bulgaria, to beat US twins Kerry and Annie Xu 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by eight points at one point, the SAR duo went on a 12-4 run to close the first game 24-22, saving four game points in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xus fought one back, 21-17, taking advantage of the Hong Kong pair's mistakes in quick succession towards the end of the second game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As fatigue appeared to affect the Americans more, the Hong Kong shuttlers won the decider, 21-11, for their first point of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Yeungs will battle Team China's Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the SAR loses, the pair will need the Americans to beat the Bulgarian sisters, Gabriela and Stefani Stoeva, by a wide margin for them to have a chance to advance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's dominance of Olympic skateboarding continued in Paris on Sunday as World No.1 Coco Yoshizawa won the women's street competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her compatriot, and the second highest ranked in the competition, Liz Akama, took silver while Brazil's Rayssa Leal overcame a poor start to the competition to win the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Cui Chenxi finished just outside the medals in fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen-year-old Yoshizawa held her arms out wide after sliding down the rail in the highest-scoring attempt of the best-trick stage of the competition, as an enthusiastic crowd at the La Concorde venue cheered wildly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Akama, who had a slim lead heading into the best trick portion of the competition, nailed a sublime 270 switch front board on her opening trick but could not improve on that effort. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting are one win away from a medal at the Paris Olympics, after advancing to the mixed doubles semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They defeated Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao of Spain 4-2 in the quarter-finals on Sunday at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair dropped the first game 9-11, but they won the next two games 11-9 and 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth game saw a suspenseful back and forth with the Spanish team securing that game 12-10, but Doo and Wong fought back in the next game winning 11-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team ultimately took the win 11-8 in the last game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the final four is Hong Kong's best result in this event and Wong said they were glad to have made the breakthrough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I'm just excited like everyone else is. Because at the previous games we went out in the last eight, and now we've made a breakthrough to enter the semifinals," he told reporters post-game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very difficult match. We've lost to them before. This time we gained our revenge. Ah Doo performed very well on the table. I trusted her 120 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Doo, it was the perfect tonic after losing her first-round singles match earlier in the day to North Korea's Pyon Song-gyong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo will square off against the North Korean team again in the semis on Monday when she and Wong face Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong at 10pm Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Koreans had defeated the world number two pair of Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan in an earlier round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong skiff sailors found themselves in second to last place after completing the first day of their Paris Olympics races on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth ranked 19th out of 20 teams in the event after three races in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They started off with 17 points in the first race, and improved to 12 points in the second. The final event of the day didn't turn out as well, as the pair finished with 19 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sailors with the fewest points win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China's pair of Wen Zaiding and Liu Tian are tenth after race day one, while New Zealanders Isaac McHardie and William McKenzie have taken the top spot so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The medal rounds are due to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the windsurfing competitions were postponed for the day due to a lack of wind. Hong Kong's Alex Cheng and Mui Ma are in the men's and women's events, respectively.

<div class="itemFullText">
 George Russell won the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa on Sunday holding off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton in a stunning Mercedes 1-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri came home in third with pole-sitter Charles Leclerc of Ferrari in fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started in 11th, finished fifth, extending his championship lead over the second McLaren of Lando Norris who finished one place further back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell began the race in sixth place and hit the front after opting for a one-stop pit strategy which saw him nursing his second set of tyres for 34 of the race's 44 laps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We definitely didn't predict this win in our strategy meeting this morning," said Russell for whom this was a third grand prix win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One-two for the team was awesome and what a way to go to the break."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen leads the championship race with 275 points, 78 clear of Norris. Red Bull lead the constructors' championship 42 points ahead of McLaren.
  <br/>

  Formula One now heads into a summer break with the next race in Zandvoort for the Dutch GP on August 25. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans booed a Dutch beach volleyball player convicted of raping an underage girl as he played his first match at the Paris Olympics, where his controversial selection has put the sport in the spotlight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven van de Velde, now 29, was convicted in 2016 of raping an underage girl and sentenced to four years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He walked onto centre court Sunday with teammate Matthew Immers on Sunday morning to cheers and applause, with many orange-clad Dutch fans standing to clap the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he was introduced individually over the loudspeaker, however, there was a loud chorus of boos from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also sporadic boos as he served throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player has won the backing of his country's national Olympic committee, and exchanged a warm hug with teammate Immers before the start of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his selection has drawn outrage among women's and sports safety groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the player would be separated from his teammates, not stay in the athletes' village, and forbidden from speaking to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His teammate Immers told reporters after the match that they had been "disappointed" by all the focus on van de Velde's past conviction, particularly after a "hard fight" to qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know the guy for two, three years together and we played every tournament," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me that's a big example that you grew, you learned a lot from it. What happened in the past... it's not good of course. But right now we are trying to enjoy and go to the next round," Immers added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ju'Riese Colon, chief executive of the US-based Center for SafeSport, said she was "deeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate" in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With teams from around the world convening in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety," she said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The maiden Olympic journeys of two SAR fencers, Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho, came to an end on Sunday, but both earned praise from their coaches for their strong performances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nineteen-year-old Chan bowed out of the women's foil individual event after she was beaten 15-8 by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16 at the Grand Palais in Paris. It's still the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong competitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sauer seized a 5-4 advantage after a back-and-forth first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world No 6 from Germany continued to impress in the second round, extending the lead to 10-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was too big a deficit for Chan, ranked 31st in the world, to overcome, but she said after the match that making it this far is already a huge accomplishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy I could reach top 16 and I think I enjoyed the stage so much, the atmosphere was amazing, and I'm very happy that I completed my first Olympics in a really good way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her coach Gregory Koenig applauded the teenage fencer for her performance, adding that Chan has the capability to compete at the highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know people can be disappointed because she doesn't bring a medal to Hong Kong. But we have to be honest, she fenced very well. She showed us she has the ability to have an amazing mindset for this kind of event, at 19 years old, her first Olympic Games," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Psychologically, she can be a great champion. Now she still has to work on the technical skills, the tactical skills, all the physical part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When all these are perfectly set out, if she can keep this mindset, she can really be in the top of the world and bring a medal in the next Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan had edged out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Hong Kong Olympic debutant, Cedric Ho, lost to Masaru Yamada of Japan 15-9 in the men's épée.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho was off to a quick start in their round of 32 match, racing to a 5-2 lead at the end of the first period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamada rallied in the next period, tying the score at 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer faltered in the third and final period which his Japanese opponent won 7-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all the times I have competed against him, I have never had a lead of more than five points. After the draw, I knew he was difficult to beat, but I wanted to try my best," Ho said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a big lead before I was overtaken, which I regret."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said Ho gave an exceptional performance despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that he was himself. That's the most important thing," he said. "The only regret is he didn't believe enough. My old coach used to say these are the moments you are more afraid of winning than losing."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pauline Ferrand-Prevot delivered France's second gold medal of the Paris Olympics as she took a high-quality field apart to win the women's cross-country mountain bike race on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old produced a devastating acceleration at the start of the second of seven laps around the dusty 4.4 kilometre circuit on Elancourt Hill and rode solo to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haley Batten of the US and Jenny Rissveds of Sweden were involved in a fierce scrap for silver with Batten bursting clear to finish runner-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Young Dutchwoman Puck Pieterse was the only rider who looked capable of making it a race and was alone in second place when she suffered a puncture on lap five and needed a wheel change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrand-Prevot, who will return to road racing after the Olympics, is a five-times cross-country world champion but suffered heartbreak at the last two Olympics when favourite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, in front of thousands of flag-waving French fans in the countryside near Versailles she reigned supreme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe it, I've worked so hard for this day that I was like a robot today," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so huge that I don't know what to say. In the final lap it was easier to enjoy it." (Reuters)

 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday booked a place in the women's 200m freestyle semifinals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey came second in her heat, 0.10 secs behind China's Li Bingjie.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem was on Sunday eliminated in the first round of the women's singles at the Paris Olympics, losing 4-1 to North Korea's Pyon Song Gyong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time SAR Olympian started off the round of 64 match losing two straight games 8-11 and 7-11, before fighting back and winning the third 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the North Korean won two more games 11-7 and 11-4 and sent Doo packing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Doo, who won bronze as part of the SAR's women's team at the Tokyo Games, will play in the mixed doubles quarter-finals with teammate Wong Chun-ting later on Sunday. They will take on the Spanish duo of Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao for a spot in the semi-finals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Sunday advanced to the quarterfinals of the men's single sculls at the Paris Olympics after finishing second in his repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu finished two seconds behind Sid Ali Boudina of Algeria, clocking 7 minutes and 12.94 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR rower was in second place through the first 500 metres, but dropped to third for the next kilometre. He picked up the pace in the final stretch and overtook Bermuda's Dara Alizadeh for second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have earned the respect of many competitors, because they thought Hong Kong's rowing team might not be able to perform well and be competitive in open events. But I showed them that I was capable to reach the quarterfinals," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had finished out of the running in Saturday's heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterfinals are set to be held on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China shaded Japan in men's artistic gymnastics qualifying at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with all-around leader Zhang Boheng hailing his team's spirit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a frenetic first day's action at Bercy Arena, a boisterous crowd was treated to a taste of the thrills and spills ahead, with American superstar Simone Biles making her eagerly awaited entrance on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian Olympic Committee won the men's team title at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games but Russian gymnasts are not defending their title, leaving China as favourites to take gold for the first time since London 2012 on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Led by Olympic debutant Zhang, China topped the team qualifying standings by 2.434 points from Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain, featuring world vault champion Jake Jarman and double Olympic pommel horse gold medallist Max Whitlock, were third ahead of Ukraine and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang topped the individual all-around table from Japan's Shinnosuke Oka and defending champion Daiki Hashimoto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy with that, it's my highest score in a major competition this year" said Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our team performed excellently. Everyone did very well and showed great team spirit." (AFP)

      <br/>
      Meanwhile in the swimming pool, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia began their Olympic swim campaign with two golds while the United States stamped their authority in the men's 4x100 metres freestyle relay to win in a time of 3 minutes, 9.28 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia took silver and Italy won bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's relay capped an exciting night of Olympic swimming at La Defense Arena, which began when Germany's Lukas Maertens surged to victory in the men's 400 metres freestyle gold medal, narrowly missing the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old was under world record pace for 350 metres before fading in the final stretch to touch in 3 minutes, 41.78 seconds ahead of Australia's Elijah Winnington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korean 2024 world champion Kim Woo-min took bronze in 3 minutes, 42.50 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maertens was overcome with emotion after his win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Means everything to me -- you can see my progress in performance... I am extremely happy and just overwhelmed," said Maertens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't put into words what I am feeling now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's 400 metres freestyle final wasn't as fast as expected but it saw defending champion and world record holder Ariarne Titmus stamp her dominance from the get go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian led from start to finish to win in 3 minutes 57.49 seconds, holding off the challenge from Canada's Summer McIntosh who took silver while US star Katie Ledecky grabbed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just happy to get the result for myself and I feel so honoured to be a part of the race and be alongside legends like Katie," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look up to her so much as an athlete and there's certainly not a rivalry beyond the races. I really respect her as a person and I hope that I put on a good show tonight and everyone enjoyed it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia also claimed their fourth consecutive gold in the women's 400 freestyle relay in an Olympic record time of 3 minutes, 28.92 seconds as the Dolphins out fought their American rivals who took silver in an Americas record time while China won bronze with a new Asian mark. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing queen Vivian Kong on Sunday won the women's epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics in the most dramatic fashion, defeating local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in a fence-off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Frenchwoman, ranked sixth in the world, started off strong, taking a 7-1 lead in the second round after taking the first 4-0, to the delight of the home crowd, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at the Grand Palais.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With momentum fully on Mallo-Breton's side, world number one Kong changed sword in an apparent attempt to regroup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China athlete then fenced on a 9-3 run to tie the score at 10-10 in the middle of the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencers took the score to 12-12 for the one-minute fence off, and Kong struck first to take home the SAR's first gold medal at this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what went through her mind when she clawed back from the big deficit, Kong said she didn't want to "lose ugly" and not be able to fence with "the Hong Kong spirit".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also thanked people in Hong Kong for showing support. "Thank you for staying up and watching, and I know, I'm so grateful," Kong told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really thankful, I'm really grateful, I'm just so lucky because every [fencer] deserves it, in fencing anything can happen, I love all the girls here, I just can't believe it's me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tearful Kong also said that in the past, she was afraid of losing and got more nervous. But she now believed that, as she's worked to the best of her abilities and everyone around her has done their best to support her, she no longer had to sweat herself out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong fencer's coach for the past nine years, Octavian Zidaru, said he thinks Kong has made amazing progress and overcame lots of injuries to reach the top of the Olympic podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Kong now has many moves and tactics at her disposal, and in the past month he's tried to just calm her nerves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last month, I tried not to put any pressure on her, even in Hong Kong," Zidaru told reporters. "I told her, 'we participate in this Olympic Games like in any other competition.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's only the third Hong Kong gold in history and follows fellow fencer Edgar Cheung's foil victory in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee sent his congratulations, while the sports minister, Kevin Yeung, said after watching the final in Paris that he was "touched and delighted by her performance and demeanour of a great athlete".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as Macron, spectators who saw Kong's triumph included US First Lady Jill Biden and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones.
