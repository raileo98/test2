<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary golfer Gary Player, who won more than 160 professional tournaments over a career that spanned seven decades, will feature at the Fanling course in November as an ambassador of the LINK Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South African player hailed the tournament as “Asia’s Major”, marking “golf's development in China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Taichi Kho, the first player from the SAR to win on the Asian Tour, said he was excited to return to his home Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s the event I've been looking forward to the whole year and whether I play well or not, I know everyone has my back and I feel so much support from the local crowd and the Hong Kong Golf Club and everyone involved,” said Kho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think golf is a sport that comes and goes. Sometimes you score well and sometimes you don't. But I feel very proud of the fact that I've been able to stay focused all year and stay disciplined to do what I set out to do.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So it hasn't surprised me that my golf has come along nicely the second half of the year and I look forward to continuing that momentum into the final stretch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year’s champion, Ben Campbell of New Zealand, will also play to defend his title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Open will take place from November 21 to 24, featuring a prize purse of US$2 million.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students who got to meet Hong Kong's Olympians in person on Wednesday said they learnt a valuable lesson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sharing session, which followed an open-top bus parade by the athletes, took place behind closed doors inside government headquarters in Tamar and lasted about half an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlie, who trains in track and field, said she found out what it takes to become an elite athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a great opportunity for us student athletes to have a better understanding of how high, elite-level athletes, how they compete, what they prepare mentally, physically and also maybe psychologically on such a big stage, the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it's a great experience for us to know more about the profession, and also it allows us to be more motivated for our own respective sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the session, the athletes headed outdoors to meet fans who had been waiting at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey drew cheers everywhere she went, and she stopped to sign autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians then gathered on the lawn for a photo with some primary school pupils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes' packed schedule was set to continue in the afternoon with a lunch hosted by Chief Executive John Lee, followed by a joint reception by the SAR government and the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China.

 The Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics on Wednesday received a hero's welcome around town, with excited fans braving the rain to applaud the athletes on board two open-top buses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 90-minute parade featured members of the team such as Paris gold medallist and fencing queen Vivian Kong and swimming star Siobhan Haughey, who took home two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's only two-time Olympic champion, fencer Edgar Cheung, did not attend the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two buses carrying the star-studded delegation set off from the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Sha Tin and passed by Tai Wai MTR station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier, considered the best viewing locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shirley, one of hundreds of onlookers, voiced her support for the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All athletes are worthy of our attention, because everyone has to put in time and effort. Not just the champions and runners-up, but all Hong Kong athletes. They all deserve our applause," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Su was part of the enthusiastic crowds in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so excited. It was amazing. I yelled the loudest at the scene. I cheered for Vivian Kong, Siobhan Haughey, and Hong Kong. I told Vivian Kong not to cry, and to give us smiles," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dan, who's from California, said: "I think it's great. Hong Kong needs to support its athletes and its sports people more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a good way to meet the people of Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes received roaring applause as they arrived at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alice, 11, said she got an autograph from Haughey towards the end of the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that she is very perseverant. When she sets a goal, she won't give up. I also swim, so we are kind of the same person," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The athletes] did a great job and I want them to keep going and never give up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR team bagged two gold and two bronze medals at the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City forward Phil Foden won the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foden played a key role in City winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old scored 19 times and delivered eight assists for Pep Guardiola's team as they pipped Arsenal to the title on the last day of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win this award is something very special and it is one that I am very proud of and grateful for. To be recognised this way by your fellow professionals means everything and I would like to thank everyone who voted for me," Foden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also want to pay special thanks to Pep, the City coaches and all my teammates as they help me to try and get better every single day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden has already set his sights on a fifth successive Premier League crown after City started their title defence with a 2-0 win at Chelsea on Sunday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Women's T20 World Cup scheduled for October has been moved out of Bangladesh and will instead take place in the United Arab Emirates, the International Cricket Council announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision to change the venue comes after unrest that led to the overthrow of prime minister Sheikh Hasina after 15 years of iron-fisted rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 450 people were killed in the weeks of protests leading up to her August 5 ouster, most by police fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank the team at the BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) for exploring all avenues to try and enable the event to be hosted in Bangladesh," ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But travel advisories from the governments of a number of the participating teams meant that wasn't feasible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "However, they will retain hosting rights. We look forward to taking an ICC global event to Bangladesh in the near future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tournament will be staged October 3-20 across two venues in the UAE – Dubai and Sharjah. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World men's number one Jannik Sinner has been cleared of fault or negligence after failing two drug tests in March, the International Tennis Integrity Authority (ITIA) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An independent tribunal accepted Sinner's explanation that the contamination of banned substance clostebol happened when a member of his support team applied an over-the-counter spray on to treat a small wound of their own earlier this year, the ITIA said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That support team member applied the spray between 5 and 13 March, during which time they also provided daily massages and sports therapy to Sinner, resulting in unknowing transdermal contamination," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ruling is subject to appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the ITIA added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, on Tuesday recorded the first senior Grand Slam victory of his career, after beating Chile's Cristian Garin in the first qualifying round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong went a set down, 4-6, before fighting back 7-6, 6-3 for the victory against Garin, who's now ranked 116th in the world but was once as high as 17th in 2021 and made it the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China player is currently ranked 38 spots lower than the Chilean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong will next play Chinese Taipei's Hsu Yu-hsiou in the second round of qualifiers. Hsu is ranked 185th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are three rounds of qualifiers in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The draw for the main round of the men's singles will be made at Friday midnight, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Wong won the Australian Open junior doubles title two years ago.

    Sabalenka, Sinner victorious at Cincinnati Open final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This is Sabalenka's first trophy since winning the Australian Open in January. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766839_1_20240820083919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka thrust herself into US Open title contention on Monday with a 6-3, 7-5 defeat of Jessica Pegula to win the 15th title of her career at the Cincinnati Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The third seed – who missed Wimbledon with a shoulder injury – won a trophy for the first time since collecting her second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played in the final and that I was able to get this title. It's really important going into the US Open," Sabalenka said. "I'm sure Jess and I will have more battles in the future – let's keep it up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the men's draw, world number one Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe in straight sets to secure his maiden Cincinnati Open championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner claimed his fifth victory of the season in emphatic style, swatting aside Tiafoe 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in 1hr 36min to underscore his credentials for next Monday's US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian top seed bided his time in the first set before breaking the match open in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiafoe, whose game faded after losing the first-set tiebreaker, still made an impression. The American, who moves into the ranking top-20, saved three match points before Sinner claimed his 15th career title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cincinnati is the fifth trophy of 2024 for the 23-year-old Italian, who began the season with an Australian Open title.

  "I'm happy, this was a very difficult week," Sinner said. "It was tough mentally but I tried to do my best. I'm just glad I kept my level in the important moments. I handled the situations on court well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Sinner's third in an ATP Masters event after previous victories in Toronto and Miami. (AFP)

 Dan Lawrence will open the batting for England in the first Test of a three-match series against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, while Matthew Potts has been drafted in to compensate for the loss of captain Ben Stokes to injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawrence has only operated as an opener a handful of times in his first-class career but returns to the England side for the first time in two-and-a-half years after Zak Crawley's fractured finger opened up a vacancy at the top of the order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, 25-year-old Potts provides an extra bowling option with all-rounder Stokes set to miss the entire series after tearing his hamstring during The Hundred. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thierry Henry has decided to step down from his role as coach of the France under-21 football team, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former France international Henry made the decision after guiding the under-23 side to a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The all-time leading goalscorer for Premier League giants Arsenal took over as coach of the French youth side last summer and was under contract until June 2025 but decided to step away for "personal reasons", according to the FFF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry oversaw Les Bleuets' first run to the final of an Olympics men's tournament since winning gold in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His young side eventually went down 5-3 after extra time against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss ended a promising run that had started inauspiciously after Henry was obliged to make several changes to his squad pre-tournament, due to the refusal of certain clubs to release their players for the Games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan announced his retirement from international football on Monday after leading his country at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "After a few weeks of reflection, I have come to the conclusion that it is time to end my national team career," Gundogan said in a German FA statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look back with great pride on 82 international matches for my home country – a number that I could never have dreamed of when I made my debut for the senior national team in 2011."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan, who turns 34 in October, was in the Germany team that reached the Euro 2024 quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My highlight was clearly the huge honour of being able to lead the team as captain at our home European Championship last summer," said the Barcelona midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan made his debut for Germany against Belgium in October 2011 but missed their 2014 World Cup triumph with a back injury. He was also ruled out of Euro 2016 due to a dislocated kneecap. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Equestrian athlete Natasha Tse left for Britain on Monday for two final weeks of training ahead of the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Growing up with cerebral palsy, which hinders movement and muscle control, Tse embraced horse-riding at a young age of four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making her Paralympic debut in London at just 15, the veteran is gearing up for her fourth Games in early September, where she'll be competing in the individual para dressage event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this time, Tse is bringing two “horses”. Check out our video to find out why.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé was left frustrated on his Real Madrid La Liga debut on Sunday as a resilient Real Mallorca held the Spanish and European champions to a 1-1 draw in their title defence opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French superstar was thwarted by Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif and after Rodrygo Goes sent Madrid ahead early on the hosts levelled in the second half through Vedat Muriqi's towering header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's star-studded side struggled to break down Mallorca, who came closer to winning the game in the final stages at Son Moix stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Los Blancos defender Ferland Mendy was sent off in stoppage time for a high challenge on Muriqi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We went ahead, we had chances to score the second, and then in the second half we lacked balance," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We conceded counter-attacks, it was not a good game, it was quite a clear game to see that we need to defend better and have better balance on the pitch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti selected the same starting line-up which defeated Atalanta to win the Uefa Super Cup on Thursday, with Jude Bellingham in midfield behind the Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo attacking line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé scored in that victory but the former Paris Saint-Germain forward was unable to celebrate his first match in his new homeland with another goal. (AFP)

    Niewiadoma wins Tour de France Femmes by four seconds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma won her first women's Tour de France title by just four seconds on Sunday as she dug in during the race's gruelling final Alpine ascent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Canyon SRAM rider summited the daunting Alpe d'Huez mountain one minute one second behind stage winner Demi Vollering to maintain her grip on the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so crazy to be honest, the whole stage was such a crazy rollercoaster," said a visibly emotional Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've gone through such a terrible time on this climb, like I hated everything, then to arriving at the finish line and learning that I won Tour de France, which is insane. It's so mind-blowing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour was turned upside down on Thursday during the fifth stage when Vollering was caught up in a huge crash six kilometres from the finish in Amneville, losing 1min 47sec on the leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After third-placed finishes in the previous two Tours and a disappointing eighth-place finish at the 2024 Olympic Games road race, the victory tasted even sweeter for Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think last year's third place was there to reward me with this victory and same as two weeks ago I was so disappointed getting stuck behind a crash during the Olympics," said the Limanowa-native.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like during this week, all the stars aligned for my team and for myself." (AFP)

    Man City beat Chelsea to start title defence

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former Chelsea favourite Mateo Kovacic, (centre), beats Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez at his near post. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766678_1_20240819022912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City got their Premier League title defence off to a winning start as goals from Erling Haaland and Mateo Kovacic inflicted a 2-0 defeat on Enzo Maresca in his first match in charge of Chelsea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haaland marked his 100th appearance for the club with his 91st goal before Kovacic struck on his return to Stamford Bridge to give Pep Guardiola's men the perfect start to their attempt to win a record fifth consecutive English top-flight title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were shorn of all four of their Euro 2024 finalists – Rodri, Kyle Waker, John Stones and Phil Foden – from the start as Guardiola opted to give them extra time off to recover from their summer exertions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the champions were still able to lay down a marker against one of the few sides they failed to beat in the league last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca has the tough task of moulding a functioning team unit from a bloated Chelsea squad that has 43 players and over 50 on the books including those on loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consequences of those difficult decisions played out even before kick-off as Raheem Sterling's camp released a statement expressing his dismay at being left out of the matchday squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Chilwell was another to face the cull, while Conor Gallagher and Romelu Lukaku are among those not to have been handed squad numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  None of Chelsea's nine summer signings to date were included in Maresca's starting line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even more surprisingly, Enzo Fernandez was named captain despite being embroiled in a race row for a post on social media after Argentina's Copa America victory last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City, by contrast, are a model of continuity and consistent excellence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland was one of City's few stars to have had a summer off from international tournaments and took just 18 minutes to make his mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeremy Doku's low cross was deflected by Bernardo Silva into the Norwegian's path and he coolly dinked over Robert Sanchez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne curled inches wide and Sanchez leapt high to turn over Doku's deflected shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chelsea ended the first half in the ascendency and should have been level before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ederson spilled Cole Palmer's tame shot but was bailed out by Nicolas Jackson's straying needlessly offside before he turned in the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden was forced into action earlier than Guardiola would have hoped at half-time as the lively Savinho was forced off injured on his Premier League debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lack of pre-season minutes for many on show was apparent in the more pedestrian pace than normal for a major Premier League clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea did most of the pressing for an equaliser but offered City chances to extend their lead in doing so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made a fine save to deny Haaland a second before De Bruyne again fired inches off target when unmarked at the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Chelsea goalkeeper was at fault for the goal that sealed their fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kovacic was allowed to burst through the midfield unchallenged and took aim for the top corner, which he found thanks to a weak hand from Sanchez. (AFP)

    Toney-less Brentford get the better of Crystal Palace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brentford's Mark Flekken can only watch as Palace's equaliser rolls in. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766671_1_20240818233029.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brentford shrugged off the absence of Ivan Toney to get their Premier League season off to a flying start with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa got the goals for the Bees, who had left out England international Toney over speculation surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toney has less than a year left to run on his contract with the London club and is attracting interest from Saudi clubs after his role in helping England to the Euro 2024 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford boss Thomas Frank said pre-match his side had shown last season they can cope without Toney – who missed much of last term due to a betting ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guehi did captain Crystal Palace despite the interest in him shown by Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England defender had an outstanding Euros but a moment to forget for Brentford's opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbeumo raced onto Wissa's pass and cut inside Guehi before firing into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palace ended last season in sensational form under Oliver Glasner and will feel hard done by not to have earned at least a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eberechi Eze had a brilliantly executed near post free-kick harshly ruled out for a foul by Will Hughes when the score was still level at 0-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bright Palace start to the second half was rewarded when Ethan Pinnock turned Daniel Munoz's header into his own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seconds later, Odsonne Edouard slotted home Eze's pass only to be denied by a marginal offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was Brentford who grabbed the vital third goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dean Henderson could only parry Nathan Collins' shot straight into the path of Wissa, who bundled home.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot got off to a winning start as Liverpool manager with a 2-0 win at newly-promoted Ipswich on Saturday as Arsenal began their Premier League title challenge by beating Wolves by the same scoreline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newcastle defied an early red card for Fabian Schar to edge past Southampton 1-0, while Brighton ran riot under new manager Fabian Hurzeler in a 3-0 victory at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot has huge shoes to fill at Anfield after the departure of Jurgen Klopp, who restored the Reds to the top of the English game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman was left less than impressed by his side's first 45 minutes at Portman Road as Ipswich flew out of the traps on their return to the Premier League for the first time in 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Liverpool were a different side after the break as goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah barely reflected their dominance to get Slot off to the perfect start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We as a team made a big change at half-time because we came out totally different to how we had come out in the first half," said the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second half, we won more duels, we won more second balls and we played more balls in behind because if the other team takes the risk of playing one-v-one and you have the likes of Luis Diaz, Mo Salah and Diogo Jota then use them, play the balls in behind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have finished second to Manchester City in each of the past two seasons and are highly-fancied to be the champions' closest challengers again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kai Havertz opened the scoring at the Emirates from Bukayo Saka's cross to reward the Gunners' early dominance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men needed a vital save from David Raya to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen and Matheus Cunha missed a huge chance to level before Arsenal made the points safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The roles from the first goal were reversed as this time Havertz teed up Saka to lash home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's hopes of a winning start to the season looked to have been undone when Schar was sent off after just 28 minutes for what the referee deemed a headbutt on Ben Brereton Diaz despite limited contact between the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton had dominated even the early exchanges against the Magpies' full compliment but failed to convert from 19 shots and nearly 80 percent possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Newcastle were clinical as Alexander Isak teed up Joelinton for the only goal just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's final season at Goodison Park got off to a nightmare start as 31-year-old Hurzeler enjoyed a dream start to life in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaoru Mitoma fired Brighton in front on his return from injury that saw the Japanese international miss much of last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Welbeck added a second after the break before Everton were reduced to 10 men when Ashley Young saw red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Adingra made it 3-0 late on and only a VAR review denied Brighton a fourth through Yasin Ayari.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Semenyo stepped into the void left at Bournemouth by the departure of Dominic Solanke with a late equaliser to salvage a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City begin their defence of the title in the standout fixture of the weekend at Chelsea on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand thumped Argentina 42-10 on Saturday as Will Jordan grabbed two of their six tries in The Rugby Championship to avenge last week's shock defeat by the Pumas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Damian McKenzie scored 17 points in Auckland as the All Blacks defied wet conditions in a skilled attacking display to maintain their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was vast improvement on the 38-30 loss in Wellington last week, with an explosive first-half performance pushing the hosts 35-3 ahead through five converted tries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was built on a dominant display from the forwards, who heeded the call for "redemption" issued to them by coach Scott Robertson after they were outplayed a week earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina's scrum was overpowered and they weren't the same force at the breakdown in a performance punctuated by mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their lone try came late in the match to fullback Juan Cruz Mallia, meaning the second half was drawn 7-7, helped by tighter defence from the visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was New Zealand's best performance under first-year coach Robertson in his fifth match in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory continued New Zealand's remarkable record in Auckland, where they've won 50 Tests since their last defeat, against France in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed all his six conversion attempts and his general play was superior to the first Test, mixing an astute long kicking game with some clever chips to counter the Pumas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The playmaker also opened the scoring with a try after pouncing on a chip from Jordie Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santiago Carreras responded with a Pumas penalty goal before New Zealand captain Ardie Savea powered over for his 27th Test try -- lifting him level with former skipper Richie McCaw for the most by an All Blacks forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Caleb Clarke and Jordan were both put into space for tries -- the latter capitalising on a blindside break from scrum-half TJ Perenara.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie's sweetly timed pass put Beauden Barrett across just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan continued the rout soon after the break, lifting him to 33 tries in as many Tests in his first starting appearance since last year's World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game entered a lull before Mallia's try and a late yellow card was shown to All Blacks hooker Asafo Aumua for a high tackle. (AFP)

    Manchester United see off Fulham after shaky start

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes celebrates after the match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766529_1_20240817053109.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joshua Zirkzee made himself a Manchester United hero on his debut with a late winner to beat Fulham 1-0 in the opening match of the Premier League season on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, lacking match fitness after his move from Bologna last month, came on only for the final half hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch international saved the Red Devils from a frustrating evening at Old Trafford when he poked in Alejandro Garnacho's cross on 87 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn't be better," said Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been told (scoring at the Stretford End) is one of the best feelings at Manchester United. I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United boss Erik ten Hag survived at the end of last season, despite finishing eighth in the Premier League, thanks to winning the FA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether that shock victory over rivals and English champions Manchester City in May could be a springboard remains to be seen after a performance that was eerily reminiscent of many last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag said on the eve of the game that his side were "not ready" for the new campaign with key players missing through injury or a lack of match fitness, and it showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Fernandes started in a centre-forward role in the absence of Rasmus Hojlund, while Zirkzee was on the bench after returning to pre-season late following Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noussair Mazraoui was thrown straight into the starting line-up at left-back after joining from Bayern Munich this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was no place in the squad for Jadon Sancho even though the winger and Ten Hag appeared to have settled their differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fulham won at Old Trafford last season for the first time in 20 years in February during a torrid campaign for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Little seemed to have changed in the opening 20 minutes as the visitors started confidently and Andre Onana did well to prevent Kenny Tete's dipping effort finding the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fulham were nearly masters of their own downfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro pounced on Bernd Leno's sloppy pass and teed up Fernandes, who could only fire straight at Fulham's German goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro's struggles played a large part in United's problems last season, but the Brazilian started the new campaign more like his old self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An incisive through ball from the former Real Madrid midfielder created another brilliant chance for Fernandes, who again could not beat Leno from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's lack of a predatory striker continued to haunt them after the break as Leno spread himself brilliantly to this time deny Mason Mount a rare goal since his move from Chelsea just over a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag turned to Garnacho and Zirkzee from the bench in the search of a winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In doing so United left themselves open and Fulham could have secured another famous three points at the Theatre of Dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreas Pereira's poor pass cost Alex Iwobi the chance to run clean through on goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments later Lisandro Martinez produced a goal-saving clearance from Pereira's dangerous low cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was the home side that snatched all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho's ball from the right was not the best, but Zirkzee managed to get a toe on it to divert it beyond Leno into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United should have had a second in stoppage time when Garnacho somehow skewed wide with an open goal to aim at from Marcus Rashford's unselfish pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But United held on to give Ten Hag the winning start he badly needed. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

    'Raygun' hits back at critics of her Olympic routine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael Gunn said the backlash to her much-ridiculed Olympic performance has been “devastating,” adding she took the competition seriously and gave her best effort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old b-girl, known as "Raygun", said in a video posted to social media that she wasn’t prepared for the level of negative attention she has received since judges awarded her zero points in her Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) criticised an anonymous online petition attacking the Paris Games competitor, saying it was “vexatious, misleading and bullying.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympic debut in Paris, and one of the lasting images was the performance of Gunn, a 36-year-old university professor from Sydney — who did a “kangaroo dance” among other questionable moves during her routine — and did not receive a single point from any of the nine judges in either round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn was subsequently mocked for her efforts, including a parody on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in the United States. In the video, she said she was subjected to abuse that went beyond criticism of her dance moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’d really like to ask the press to please stop harassing my family, my friends, the Australian breaking community and the broader street dance community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn, who has not yet returned to Australia, received strong support from Australian Olympic team leader Anna Meares while in Paris. On Thursday, the AOC went a step further, taking aim at what it called erroneous material published online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief executive officer Matt Carroll said the the AOC had written to Change.org, which had published a petition criticising Gunn and the AOC, demanding that it be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 people had signed the petition claiming Gunn had “manipulated” Olympic qualification processes. The petition appeared to have been removed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carroll said the petition “contained numerous falsehoods designed to engender hatred against an athlete who was selected in the Australian Olympic team through a transparent and independent qualification event and nomination process.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking at the Olympics might have been one-and-done in Paris. The sport is not on the competition list for Los Angeles in 2028, and also is unlikely to appear in 2032 at Brisbane, Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online criticism of Gunn this past week has included suggestions the Oceania qualifying event held in Sydney last October was set up to favour her, and questioned the judging that allowed Gunn to qualify .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AOC said Thursday the Oceania qualifying event was conducted under the Olympic qualification system determined by the international governing body, the World DanceSport Federation, and approved by International Olympic Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unattributed social media comments also suggested Gunn and her husband, fellow breaker Samuel Free, had held positions within Australian breaking organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Rachael Gunn holds no position with AUSBreaking or DanceSport Australia in any capacity,” the AOC said Thursday. “She is simply an athlete who competed in the qualifying event which she won.” (AP)

 Hungary's Blanka Vas won the fifth stage of the Tour de France Femmes on Thursday with Dutch teammate Demi Vollering losing the race lead after being caught up in a big crash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma finished second to take the leader's yellow jersey from defending champion Vollering who dropped to ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A pile-up with six kilometres to go involving 10 riders including Vollering decimated the peloton in the run to Amneville in northeastern France.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly agreed terms to become the new coach of the United States national team, according to multiple reports on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Athletic and ESPN reported that unnamed sources confirmed Pochettino, who parted ways with English Premier League side Chelsea in May, would replace Gregg Berhalter as boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino, 52, would arrive as the United States prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino left Chelsea after finishing sixth in the Premier League in his only season in charge, after previous stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports said the deal was struck after multiple conversations with US Soccer Federation technical director Matt Crocker, and that no contract has been signed nor has the federation's board of directors agreed a deal with Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentinian cannot sign a contract with US Soccer until a pay situation with Chelsea is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino would be expected to take over the US squad in time for a friendly against Canada on September 7 at Kansas City. (AFP)

 Second-ranked defending champion Coco Gauff crashed out in her opening match at the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Open, falling to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The second-round shock to America's Paris Olympic flag-bearer stunned a partisan crowd in the US heartland in the final major tuneup for the US Open on August 26, where Gauff is defending champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva, ranked 34th, has made a recent habit of upsets, knocking off world number one Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon third round barely a month ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really proud of myself," said Putintseva. "Even if the crowd was cheering for Coco, they were fair with me. "These courts are so fast, you have to just play on instinct. That's what I did."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff became the youngest winner at Cincinnati a year ago at age 19 and carried that success into her first Grand Slam triumph at the US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva will next face Spain's Paula Badosa, who defeated Anna Kalinsyaka 6-3, 6-2. (AFP)

 Rookie road rider Puck Pieterse clung on to win stage four of the Tour de France Femmes in Liege on Wednesday, with compatriot Demi Vollering taking second in a photo finish to conserve the yellow jersey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the first-ever road race victory for the 22-year-old cross-discipline star Pieterse at her first Tour de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result lifted the Dutch rider to second overall, and gave her the best young rider's white jersey and the polka dot climb jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To take the win here, in a sprint ahead of Demi, it's really a dream coming true," said Pieterse. "They were riding for the general classification. I'm just here for the stage. I'm fresh. I just tried to keep a poker face and take it from the sprint."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering, meanwhile, held onto the leader's yellow jersey she pulled on after Tuesday's time-trial in Rotterdam. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé enjoyed a "great night" as he struck on his Real Madrid debut to help his new side claim a record sixth Uefa Super Cup with a 2-0 win over Atalanta on Wednesday in Warsaw.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The superstar French forward has waited years to play for his dream club and after finally signing for Los Blancos this summer at the end of his Paris Saint-Germain deal, celebrated his first appearance with a goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fede Valverde broke the deadlock from close range for the Champions League holders in the 59th minute after the Italian Europa League winners held their own in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid began to rack up the chances and Mbappé rifled home in the 68th minute after Jude Bellingham spotted his dart into space in the box to seal the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great night, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, to play with this shirt, with this badge, for these fans," Mbappé said, speaking in fluent Spanish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's triumph ensured coach Carlo Ancelotti equalled former Los Blancos coach Miguel Munoz on a joint-record 14 titles won at the helm of the club.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of the SAR's Olympians have mixed views over the remuneration local athletes receive, with some saying a better package would certainly help, while others said Hongkongers already receive good support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Entry level full-time athletes can get around HK$7,000 a month in sponsorship from the Sports Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing a recent call from badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu, fencer Cedric Ho said more support would certainly help, noting that plenty of athletes have to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As someone who had been there myself, back in the day I would need to save money sometimes," he said on Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I did was I was extremely thrifty, I don't go out for a meal and force myself to eat whatever at the institute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, sailor Nicholas Halliday said Hong Kong athletes already do quite well compared to some overseas counterparts, calling the pay packages "reasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the airport, after competing at the Paris Olympics, another sailor, Russell Aylsworth, agreed, saying they "owe it all" to the institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the Hong Kong Sports Institute has given Nic and I and my sailing partner Akira Sakai tremendous support, they've been very, very helpful. Without them, I wouldn't be able to call myself an Olympian for sure," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just want to thank everyone in Hong Kong for supporting and watching the both of us sail, I just want to inspire the youth, and for all the other sailors coming up, just to continue to train hard and push hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Halliday and Ho said they plan to qualify for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for now, Halliday said he's looking forward to having some down time and enjoying some Hong Kong food favourites like cheung fun.

 Defending champion Demi Vollering won Tuesday's 6.3km time trial through the streets of Rotterdam to take over the lead after three stages of the women's Tour de France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fellow Dutchwoman Charlotte Kool made it two wins from two stages on home soil in the morning, before Vollering clocked the fastest time in the second part of a Tuesday double-header to grab the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering powered around the course in 7min 25sec to finish ahead of Olympic time-trial bronze medallist Chloe Dygert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very surprised that I managed to win this time trial. Even with a difference of five seconds. I have no idea how that's possible," said Vollering.

 Kylian Mbappé appears ready to make his debut for Real Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup against Atalanta on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the France striker arrived in good shape following the European Championship and was adapting well to the team after a week of practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé “could play tomorrow,” Ancelotti said Tuesday at a news conference at the National Stadium in Warsaw where the match will be played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé is the biggest draw in the Polish capital after finally joining Madrid following a drawn-out saga with his former club, Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was introduced to the club’s fans at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium last month,  but wasn’t part of the squad on its U.S. tour while he rested after Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He joins a slew of world-class forwards at Madrid, including Vinícius Júnior, another new signing in Brazil striker Endrick, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo and Arda Guler. (AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn hamstring and will miss the Test series against Sri Lanka, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Tuesday.

  <br/>
  "England Men's Test Captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the summer after tearing his left hamstring while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred on Sunday," said an ECB statement.
  <br/>

  The 33-year-old all-rounder will be replaced as Test skipper by vice-captain Ollie Pope, the statement added.

  <br/>
  "As a result of the scans conducted in Leeds on Tuesday, Stokes will miss England's three-match Test series against Sri Lanka," said the ECB. "The all-rounder is aiming to return for England's winter Test tour of Pakistan, scheduled to start in early October."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former England batsman Graham Thorpe died after being struck by a train at a railway station, an inquest into his death heard on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 55-year-old took his own life, his wife Amanda revealed on Monday in an interview with The Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe died on the morning of August 4 having suffered "traumatic injuries" during the incident at Esher railway station, southwest of London, Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area coroner for Surrey, Simon Wickens, recorded Thorpe's cause of death as one of multiple injuries during the short hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner offered his "sincere condolences" not just to Thorpe's family, but to "all those touched by his life and career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A date for the full inquest will be fixed at a later time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's death plunged the cricket world into mourning for the popular star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoyed an impressive England career as an elegant batsman from 1993 to 2005, before spending 12 years in various coaching roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Thorpe was hospitalised in May 2022 and declared "seriously ill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe told The Times that the former Surrey batsman attempted suicide two years ago before taking his own life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite having a wife and two daughters whom he loved and who loved him, he did not get better. He was so unwell in recent times and he really did believe that we would be better off without him and we are devastated that he acted on that and took his own life," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe added: "Graham was renowned as someone who was very mentally strong on the field and he was in good physical health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But mental illness is a real disease and can affect anyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's daughter Kitty, 22, said the family "are not ashamed" of talking about his death, adding: "There is nothing to hide and it is not a stigma."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-hander featured in 100 Test matches and 82 one-day internationals for England, scoring over 9,000 runs for his country, including 16 Test hundreds. (AFP)

 Dutch rider Charlotte Kool kept her head amid a chaotic bunched sprint finish to win the first stage of the women's Tour de France on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It was really hectic but I like it. I kept on thinking 'I like hectic, I like chaos'," said the 25-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I went so early and I thought it's too long and it hurt so bad but it was enough in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kool, born in North Holland, took the yellow jersey on home soil as the women's Tour got underway in the Netherlands with a 123-kilometre flat ride from Rotterdam to The Hague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Topping 60kmh as she crossed the line, the Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL rider claimed her maiden Tour win with an unstoppable surge in the last 100 metres to complete the stage in a time of two hours 47 minutes and 40 seconds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Atletico Madrid signed striker Julian Alvarez from Manchester City on Monday in a deal reported to be worth up to 85 million euros (US$93 million).
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The club has reached an agreement with Manchester City for the transfer of the Argentine forward, who has signed a contract for the next six seasons," said Atletico in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish reports say Atletico will pay 75 million euros for the forward, with potentially 10 million more in bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old arrived at City for just £14 million (16 million euros) in January 2022 from River Plate, winning two Premier League trophies and the Champions League among other silverware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez also helped Argentina lift the World Cup trophy in December 2022 and the Copa America in 2021 and 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I say goodbye to this amazing club, with a lot of emotion," Alvarez told City's club website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These have been two very special years. During this time, I have grown and learnt a lot – both as a player and as a person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez scored 36 goals for City in 103 appearances across all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's incredibly loved by the team for his behaviour but like I said many times for many players, he wants to leave and have a new challenge," said Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diego Simeone's Atletico have also signed Robin Le Normand and Alexander Sorloth as they reinforce heavily to compete with Real Madrid and Barcelona, following a disappointing fourth-place La Liga finish last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Atletico begin the new campaign with a visit to face Villarreal on August 19. (AFP)

    Ex-Olympic diving champion Tom Daley retires
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tom Daley, (right), who won silver in Paris with Noah Williams, says he now wants to spend time with his husband and two children. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765919_1_20240812232925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Olympic gold medallist Tom Daley said on Monday it was the "right time" to retire as Britain's most successful diver walked away from the sport following the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Daley, who won five Olympic medals during his decorated career, revealed the decision to call time on the sport during an interview with British Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old bowed out after winning silver in the Olympic men's synchronised 10m platform in France, having clinched the gold medal in the same event at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to make the decision at some point, and it feels like the right time. It's the right time to call it a day," Daley said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley emerged as the star of British diving after first competing at the Olympics in the 2008 Beijing Games aged just 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London in the 10m platform, as well as bronze in the men's synchronised 10m platform in Rio 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley had effectively retired after his gold medal success in Tokyo, before deciding to return for a fifth Olympics in Paris in order to compete in front of his two children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He decided ahead of the event that he would stop diving competitively once he stepped out of the pool in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels very, very surreal. I felt so incredibly nervous going into this, knowing it was my last Olympics," he told Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was a lot of pressure and expectations. I was eager for it to be done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But when I walked out, and saw my husband (Lance) and kids (Robbie and Phoenix) and my friends and family in the audience, I was like, you know what? This is exactly why I did this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was emotional at the end, up there on the platform, knowing it was going to be my last competitive dive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley's gold in Tokyo came alongside Matty Lee and he was back to defend his title in Paris after being convinced by his six-year-old son Robbie to return to the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley and partner Noah Williams claimed silver in the competition, finishing behind China a fortnight ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking forward to spending more time with his family away from the Olympic spotlight, Daley has no fears he will regret retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to be with my family. I'm really excited to be able to spend some time with them and just be able to feel a bit normal for a couple of days," said Daley, who fulfilled a childhood dream by becoming the first diver to be a British flag bearer in the Olympic opening ceremony in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's always hard when you say goodbye to your sport. Lots of things to process, but I think it's the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year felt like such a bonus and I got to compete in front of my family, my kids. I got to be a flag bearer. So yeah, bucket list ticked off on every occasion." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Just opposite the fencing stadium, the Grand Palais on the Avenue des Champs Élysées, scores of tourists have been queuing up outside the largest Olympic merchandise store to take home a taste of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paris 2024 megastore offers a variety of souvenirs, from 5 euro pens and bracelets, to giant mascots costing 800 euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekday visitors have had to wait around 15 minutes to get inside the store, but most RTHK spoke to said it was worth queuing up for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adam, a UK tourist in Paris with his kids, bought a T-shirt, a hat, a poster and some badges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We spent about 110 euros, which I think, as it's only every four years, it's something to remember the Games by, so I think it's okay every once in a while,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic mascot “Phryge”, a little red hat symbolising French liberty, is one of the bestsellers at the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas from Hong Kong bought one because he wanted something special to take home with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s unique and it's like representing the culture and France and also it represents the spirit of the Olympics, so we're trying to look for something very unique for a gift,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to the French capital can also take home the smell of a fresh baguette, with the launch of scratch-and-sniff stamps by the French postal service La Poste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's to celebrate the baguette, which is one of the symbols of France for the tourists for them to enjoy and to share this with the people they live with abroad,” said Gaspard, a worker at the Olympic Village’s post office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French baguette was given Unesco heritage status in 2022.

 Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell on Sunday became the first LIV Golf player to be suspended under its anti-doping policy for using an over-the-counter decongestant that contained a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2010 US Open champion used a decongestant at LIV's June event in Nashville that contained the banned substance levo-methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDowell posted on social media that he was struggling with severe congestion that affected his sleep prior to the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saudi-funded league said McDowell would be suspended for one tournament and fined US$125,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will be replaced in the field at the LIV Golf Greenbrier next week by an alternate. (AFP/AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes was helped off the field after suffering an injury while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred domestic cricket competition on Sunday, raising concerns he could miss the upcoming test series against Sri Lanka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old Stokes pulled up while running between the wickets as the Superchargers chased a victory target of 153 against Manchester Originals at Old Trafford. Stokes appeared to clutch his left hamstring as he was completing a quick single from the non-striker’s end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes, who had bowled 15 overs in the match, retired hurt on two runs with England teammate Harry Brook coming out to replace him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes led England to a 3-0 series sweep against West Indies last month. England opens its test series against Sri Lanka next Wednesday at Old Trafford, with the third and final test at the Oval from September 6. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris said a triumphant "au revoir" to the Olympics on Sunday as the curtain came down on its widely praised staging of the global sporting spectacular.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A star-studded closing ceremony took place in front of around 71,500 spectators at the Stade de France to crown an event that has been broadly acclaimed as one of the greatest editions of the Olympics ever held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 270 artists performed in the packed arena for an estimated 9,000 athletes who marched into the venue as the festivities got into full swing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening segment of the ceremony festivities began with France's swimming hero Leon Marchand -- winner of four gold medals at these Games -- gathering the Olympic flame from the cauldron in the centre of Paris to begin its journey to the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rugby hero Antoine Dupont -- who led the host nation to a rugby sevens gold medal in one of the early highlights of the Games -- carried a tricolore flag into the Stade de France as partying athletes swarmed the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show included a theatrical sequence entitled "Records", which was a dream-like immersive journey through time, led by a "Golden Voyager".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musicians Phoenix then entertained the crowd with a series of hits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach hailed the Paris Games as "sensational".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish - or dare I say, Seine-sational Games," Bach said in a speech at the closing ceremony, in a reference to the river which staged the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the Los Angeles Olympics, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed to the Californian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then it was time for Hollywood's top gun Tom Cruise to jump from the roof of the Stade de France into the closing ceremony before speeding off with the Olympic flag in a dramatic handover that began the anticipation for the Games in 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A beaming Cruise high-fived athletes after making the roughly 160-foot descent before jumping on a motorcycle and exiting the stadium as the crowd at the 80,000-seat stadium roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Living up to the stunning success of the Paris Games may seem like mission impossible for LA and the celebrity-rich city will lean on its stars such as leading man Cruise as the Olympic spotlight turns to Southern California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise was among the many celebrities seen taking in the action at the Paris Games, showing up at gymnastics, swimming and soccer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, Yseult, a French R&B singer, performed "Comme d’habitude," the song famously adapted into "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lights dimmed as she serenaded the stadium before fireworks lit up the sky to conclude Paris 2024. (Agencies)

 A dazzling festival of sport in Paris officially ended on Day 16 as the 2024 Olympics concluded with a spectacular closing ceremony. The baton has been passed to Los Angeles, which hosts the Games in 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US edged out France in the last event of the day in women's basketball to claim their 40th gold medal in Paris. China also won a 40th gold in women's weightlifting, but the Americans end the Games ahead of the national team due to the fact they won 44 silvers compared with China's 27. Japan finished third while hosts France were fifth. Still, China's 40 golds is its second highest ever after the Beijing Olympics of 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong China's Ceci Lee was bidding for a medal in the women's omnium, but it wasn't to be. The SAR finished 37th in the table with two gold and two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here are some of the highlights on the last day of the Olympic Games in Paris.

       The United States held off France 67-66 to win an unprecedented eighth successive women's Olympic basketball gold on Sunday and extend their run of victories at the tournament to 61 games.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A'ja Wilson scored a game-high 21 points for the Americans who won the title for the 10th time overall, surviving a buzzer-beating shot from France's Gabby Williams.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The hosts needed a three to force overtime but Williams' foot was on three-point line as she let go off the ball, so her shot counted for just two points in a dramatic finale.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu will be awarded the Olympic floor exercise bronze medal, after it was taken away from her following an appeal from the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Olympic Committee made the announcement on Sunday, one day after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the request by the American team to re-evaluate Jordan Chiles' score was lodged four seconds after the one-minute deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review, which went ahead at the time, upgraded Chiles to bronze from fifth, behind Brazil's winner Rebeca Andrade and fellow US gymnast Simone Biles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was a devastating blow for Barbosu, who thought she had bagged bronze and was already celebrating with the Romanian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can barely express my emotions, I can't believe it," Barbosu said after learning she was awarded her country's only gymnastics medal in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I heard the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A devastated Chiles took to Instagram, posting four broken hearts, adding: "I am taking this time and removing myself from social media for my mental health thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who trains with Chiles, and won team gold with her in Paris, added: "Sending you so much love Jordan. Keep your chin up Olympic champ! We love you!" (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday congratulated the SAR's athletes for their achievements at the Paris Olympics, noting it was the first time that Team Hong Kong, China had won more than one gold medal at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Golds from foil fencer Edgar Cheung and épée fencer Vivian Kong, as well as two swimming bronzes from Siobhan Haughey, put the SAR 37th in the medals table, which is the city's highest ever ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Hong Kong athlete has given their utmost and unleashed their full potential in the Olympic arena. In spite of the results, all athletes have fully exhibited their determination, perseverance and will, demonstrating their professional attitude and sportsmanship," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people of Hong Kong and I are deeply inspired and moved. The people of Hong Kong are proud of the high level of performance shown by Hong Kong athletes, and each and every one of them is a hero in our hearts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the government would provide more sporting facilities, such as converting an existing sports centre into a dedicated fencing venue, and speeding up a study on building a fencing arena and a swimming pool which can host international competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the current financial year, the administration had provided more than HK$940 million in funding to the Sports Institute through the Elite Athletes Development Fund, around a 40 percent increase from five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said with the Paris Paralympic Games later this month and Hong Kong co-hosting the National Games next year, he's confident that society would continue to support the SAR's athletes to shine and "demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Hong Kong".

<div class="itemFullText">
 For the second consecutive day, the United States silenced the home crowd in Paris as their women's basketball team narrowly edged their French counterparts, 67-66, in a gripping gold medal match to notch an eighth straight Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both teams struggled to find the basket in an unusually low-scoring first half, which ended 25-all. France shot 28 percent from the field, compared to 29 percent for Team USA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts then brought the crowd on their feet, after starting the second half on a 10-0 run to go 35-25 up for their biggest lead of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that advantage did not last, as the Americans finally broke out of a funk and scored 16 of the next 21 points to go back on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides exchanged leads in the fourth quarter, but the Americans held on to their slim edge to win by the finest of margins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Down by three with 3.8 seconds left, France could have sent the game into overtime with a three. But Gabby Williams stepped inside the three-point line as she hoisted - and made - a two-point shot as time expired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia earlier beat Belgium 85-81 in the bronze medal match, returning to the podium for the first time since London 2012.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jennifer Valente of the United States on Sunday retained her Olympic title in the women’s omnium at the Paris Games while the SAR's Ceci Lee finished 20th.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That concluded Hong Kong, China's participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente ended with 144 points in the multi-race event, consisting of the scratch, tempo, elimination and points races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland’s Daria Pikulik took silver while Ally Wollaston of New Zealand rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first scratch race, cyclists were ranked and awarded points by the order they finished the 30-lap event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente was off to a strong start and finished first, earning the maximum 40 points, with Canada’s Maggie Coles-Lyster and Georgia Baker of Australia coming from behind to grab second and third respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, making her Olympic debut, came 19th among the 22 riders to earn four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist moved up to 18th overall after the second tempo race, where the top contestant per lap was awarded a point from the fifth lap forward while 20 points were given for lapping an opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland’s Lara Gillespie came out on top in this race but Valente maintained her overall lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old SAR athlete earned 16 points by finishing 13th, giving her 20 points at the end of the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the elimination round, the last cyclist of every other lap was knocked out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente won this round as well to continue to top the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, was the fifth athlete eliminated and ended up with six points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final points race, points were awarded to the top four athletes for every 10 laps in the gruelling 80-lap race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist finished near the bottom of the pack in the race that was won by Poland’s Pikulik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, a tearful Lee described her performance as "very poor", saying she felt she let many people down, including her coaches, teammates and the former top SAR cyclist Sarah Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like in the past, I did very poorly in the scratch race, and I couldn't change that today," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though Sarah Lee very diligently tried to pass on her experience to me before the race, I still did very poorly. Coaches and teammates spent a lot of time training with me for the omnium, but I still raced very poorly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had said she hoped to finish in the top 10 overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee, who won silver at the Asian Games last year, added that her Paris experience allowed her to get a taste of just how good the world's finest cyclists are. She also said she hopes to work hard in future to improve her fitness and use of tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's cycling team head coach, Herve Dagorne, said while he could understand her frustrations, he felt she could have been more aggressive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the ominum, and the last event is the points race. You need to score points, so if you don't try, you don't get it, it will not come from the sky," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can understand it's disappointing... I wish she could have attacked more in the points race, like the Japanese did and the French did. They gained a lap, [scoring] 20 points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation earned a total of four medals in Paris: golds for fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung, and two bronzes from swimming star Siobhan Haughey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee and taekwondo athlete Lo Wai-fung will be the flagbearers for the SAR at the closing ceremony.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Weightlifter Li Wenwen on Sunday won China's 40th gold at the Paris Olympics, finishing first in the women’s +81kg category.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li lifted a combined 309kg at the South Paris Arena, 10kg more than South Korea’s Park Hye-jeong in second place and 21kg more than American Emily Campbell, who took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese weightlifter checked off with 136kg in the snatch, 5kg more than Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li then raised 173kg overhead with relative ease in the clean and jerk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having already won the race, she ditched the third lift and instead picked up her coach to celebrate on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, a two-time world champion, topped the podium in Tokyo three years ago in the women’s +87kg class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old holds the world and Olympic records for the women’s highest weightlifting category.

 Weightlifting champion Li Fabin and women's hockey team captain Ou Zixia will be the flagbearers for China in the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, 31, is a Tokyo Olympic champion who successfully defended his title in the men's 61kg weightlifting category at the Paris Games on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He performed consistently in the snatch, ultimately lifting 143kg to secure first place and set a new Olympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also holds the Olympic records for the clean and jerk and total weight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being chosen as a flagbearer is something I never even dared to imagine. I am incredibly excited and proud. This is a high recognition of the Chinese weightlifting team and the glory earned through the hard work of generations of weightlifters. I am extremely honoured to carry this responsibility," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ou led the women's hockey team to the Olympic final on Friday, where they lost to the Netherlands 3-1 in the penalty shootout.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands won Olympic women's marathon gold in Paris on Sunday in a thrilling sprint finish.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hassan traded elbows with Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia with 150 metres left, then passed her along the railing to win the race for her third distance medal of the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hassan finished in an Olympic record time of 2 hours, 22 minutes, 55 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also won bronze in the 5,000m and 10,000m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assefa finished 3 seconds behind Hassan to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya’s Hellen Obiri took the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopian-born Hassan lingered behind the leaders for the bulk of the race before summoning up the energy for a late-race kick that will go down as one of the best the sport has seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been impossible to call with all the favourites among a leading pack up until the last 10km.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three runners from China took part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang Deshun finished 59th in a time of 2:36.47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xia Yuyu was 72nd and Bai Li 76th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking from tradition, the women’s Olympic marathon was held on the final day instead of the men’s race. (Agencies)

    HKers putting rope skipping on the map in Paris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The rope skipping team is among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform in Paris. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765737_2_20240811161208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Olympic delegation isn’t the only team representing the SAR in Paris – the city’s rope skipping performance squad is also in the French capital to push for their sport to be included in future editions of the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rope skipping troupe is amping up the atmosphere at the Paris Games by performing at the Place de la Concorde, which has become the heart of urban sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time in history, various urban disciplines, such as 3x3 basketball, street and park skateboarding, BMX freestyle and breaking, have been grouped together at one site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though these sports have increasingly been adopted in the past two Games, there are those, like rope skipping, that still have not made their way to the Olympic stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's what the Hong Kong Rope Skipping Association, China, is hoping to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform at the open stage of Parc Urbain to promote urban culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tina Wong, the association's chairperson, said performing in Paris is an opportunity they could not pass up, even though the Games conflicted with the jump rope Asian Championships in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are here on the Olympic platform. We actually have the goal or you could say dream to have jump rope skipping to be included in the Olympics in 2032 in Australia because Australia is one the strongest countries in this sport. This is a more long-term goal. On a short-term basis, we are aiming for Asia,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually last year, the Olympic Council of Asia has already granted rope skipping the provisional membership, so meaning we are already included in Asia. This year, we are here. Next year, we are aiming to go to the Youth Asian Games and pave the way for the Asian Games and then the Olympics. We hope with more support, we can officially be on the Olympic stage soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four athletes from the SAR have made their way to Paris to perform, including 18-year-old Yuen Hiu-tung, who said that the atmosphere was unbelievable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s like a dream to come here because even though we paid to come here, it’s a very valuable experience for us because we don’t know when jump rope can get into [the] Olympics, so it is a good experience to promote jump rope, and also letting everyone know how is jump rope [works] and how everyone is enjoying this sport,” she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The honorary secretary general of Hong Kong's top sports body, Edgar Yang, on Sunday said the city should nurture all athletes with potential, rather than solely focusing on one or two elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to a TV programme, the senior member of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China said the SAR has huge potential for sports development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the system must be very sound, and this sound method starts from popularising and definitely not focusing on just one or two athletes - but rather on the overall system that can bring out potential. We must put in a great effort. Even for those who have not yet fully realised their potential, we must enable them to be inspired," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Paris Olympics nears its end, Yang said Hong Kong athletes are now world class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR athletes have secured two gold medals in fencing and two bronze medals in swimming.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There were 39 events up for contention on Day 15 in Paris, the second last day of these Olympics, and China went on a gold rush, completing a clean sweep of all the golds on offer in diving, table tennis and artistic swimming. The national team also celebrated Olympic wins in weightlifting, rhythmic gymnastics and boxing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That single day haul of six gold medals means China leads the table with 39 golds, ahead of the United States which has 38. Australia maintain third place in the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look back at what unfolded.
  <br/>

   China completed an historic clean sweep of all eight Olympic diving gold medals after Cao Yuan won the men's 10m platform final on Day 15 in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cao became the first to retain his Olympic 10m crown since American Greg Louganis in Seoul 1988.

    <br/>
    Like the divers, the national table tennis squad also made history by completing a clean sweep of all golds on offer at the Paris Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    China completed the feat after winning the women's team title, the sixth time the Chinese have collected the full set.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Chinese women withstood a brave Japanese challenge but eventually overpowered their opponents 3-0 to snatch gold, the fifth Olympic title out of five events.

     <br/>
     Not to be outdone by the divers and table tennis stars, China's artistic swimmers also completed a golden sweep. After winning the team event, the Chinese twin sibling pair of Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi dazzled in the pool to win gold ahead of Britain who took silver and the Netherlands the bronze.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Liu totalled 406kg, 7kg short of his own world record, for his two lifts in the recently-created weight class.

           The US continued their golden run in team sports as the men's basketball team did as expected by grinding out a 98-87 win over hosts France to claim a fifth consecutive gold medal.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           With the French sporting spotlight locked on the Bercy arena, the American showmen crushed Gallic hearts led by a fired up LeBron James, the "King" wearing shiny golden sneakers to mark the occasion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China clinched a third boxing gold at the Paris Olympics, as Li Qian was crowned women's middleweight champion after winning the bout against Panama's Atheyna Bylon on a 4-1 split decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, who took silver in Tokyo, was adjudged as the better performer in two of the three rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old top seed has now collected Olympic medals of all colours, having also won bronze in Rio de Janeiro eight years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said after the bout that by winning gold, she had made amends for the "regret" in Tokyo, and a fitting response to both herself and the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's boxers have won three golds and two silvers in Paris, with all of them coming in women's events.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The star-studded US men's basketball team successfully clinched their fifth straight Olympic gold -- beating France 98-87 in a hotly-contested final at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephen Curry hit eight three pointers to lead the Americans with 24 points. Four of his triples came in the final three minutes of the game to silence a raucous home crowd at Bercy Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of the Tokyo Olympics final three years ago, French center Victor Wembanyama finished with 26 points and seven rebounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts were able to keep the game close for much of the first three quarters, trailing 66-72 entering the final frame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Wembanyama tip-in cut the deficit to three with less than three minutes to go, but Curry then took control with his hot-shooting to put the US back up by nine with less than a minute remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After scoring his final basket, Curry, the four-time NBA champion, did his trademark “go to sleep” gesture where he puts his hands on the side of his face to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the 36-year-old sharp-shooter's first Olympic gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Durant and Devin Booker scored 15 points apiece for the Americans, while LeBron James chipped in 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite a losing effort, French forward Guerschon Yabusele continued his strong play at the Games, finishing with 20 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the bronze-medal match, Serbia beat Germany 93-83. (Agencies)

    Amateur runners revel on streets of Paris in mass run

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Running enthusiasts say they are thrilled to have a chance to follow the footsteps of their Olympic heroes in the heart of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For the first time, some 20,000 amateurs were able to run on the same route as marathon athletes on the penultimate day of the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The “Marathon For All” sets off at the French capital’s city hall and finishes at Esplanade des Invalides via Versaille, passing through landmarks such as the Louvre Museum and the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy came all the way from Hong Kong for a once in a lifetime experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because it's the Olympic Games. I think in a lifetime you cannot join. It shows that everyone can try to run on the same road, no matter if you are an elite runner or you are just a normal [person]," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another participant, Michele from the United States, hoped she won't get too distracted by the city's night scenery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most difficult part is...I'm in Paris. This is my first time here. And I love it. And so I'm very distracted with everything else that's going on. So it's really hard for me to kind of just settle in, enjoy the moment, and just be here for the marathon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elizabeth, a hill runner from London, didn’t want to miss the opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just thought it was mad not to sign up. Honestly it's incredible. I was watching the men’s race, and I'm sort of joking that I'm going to come home an Olympian."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km route pays tribute to a key event of the French Revolution - the women’s march on Versailles in 1789.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's B-Boy Phil Wizard won the inaugural Olympic men's breakdancing gold in Paris on Saturday, beating home favourite Dany Dann of France in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard, whose real name is Philip Kim, triumphed amid the opulent grandeur of the Place de la Concorde, with B-Boy Victor of the United States taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also known as breaking, the street dance is making its first and possibly last appearance at the Games, having been left off the programme for Los Angeles 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's competition saw 16 dancers - or B-Boys - going head-to-head in a series of battles, starting with a round robin before moving to a knock-out stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard, a 27-year-old former world champion, had the crowd against him in the final against Dany Dann, a 36-year-old with blue hair whose real name is Danis Civil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Canadian soon had them eating out of his hand thanks to his incredible routine, for which the nine judges awarded him a 3-0 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard explained the panel of judges were looking for "something new every round".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You may well think it's the most explosive, crazy dynamic movements that score the most points," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in breaking there's a lot of different categories and the most important thing is originality and diversity of movement."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States' men's 4x400m team set a new Olympic record en route to winning gold medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rai Benjamin, who won the 400m hurdles gold, anchored the US quartet to victory, which also featured Christopher Bailey, Vernon Norwood and Bryce Deadmon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed the relay in 2 minutes and 54.43 seconds for an exciting finish at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Botswana, with 200m champion Letsile Tebogo on their fourth leg, took silver in an African record of 2 minutes, 54.53 seconds, while Britain claimed bronze in a European record of 2 minutes, 55.83 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's 4x400m gold also went to the Americans, as Shamier Little, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Gabrielle Thomas and Alexis Homes won in three minutes, 15.27 seconds, just a tenth of a second short of the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands took silver in 3 minutes 19.50 seconds, and Britain edged Ireland for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on, American sprinter Masai Russell won the women's 100m hurdles gold in another stunning photo finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She finished the race in 12.33 seconds, a hundredth of a second ahead of France's Cyrena Samba-Mayela, who got her country's first track medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Olympic champion, Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico, got bronze in 12.36 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Emmanuel Wanyonyi ran the third-fastest time in history to win men's 800m, clocking a personal best one minute and 41.19 seconds, just barely ahead of Canada's world champion Marco Arop, who got silver. Algeria's Djamel Sedjati had the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand's Hamish Kerr became the first athlete from his country to win a high jump medal, taking gold after winning a jump-off with American Shelby McEwen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both men had cleared 2.36m, and decided they didn't want to share the top spot on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze went to Mutaz Barshim from Qatar, a joint-gold medallist at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In women's javelin, Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi sealed the gold medal with her opening throw, a season best effort of 65.80m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Faith Kipyegon broke her own Olympic record to win gold in women's 1,500m, finishing the race in 3 minutes 51.29 seconds, more than two seconds faster than her previous mark. She also became the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic 1,500m golds with another superb display of middle distance running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen middle distance star won gold in men's 5,000m, finishing the race in 13 minutes and 13.66 seconds. (Agencies)

    China achieves artistic swimming double

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For the third time on Saturday, China secured a clean sweep of gold medals in a sport after Wang Qianyi and Wang Liuyi clinched the duet in artistic swimming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old twin siblings from Shenzhen performed last out of 17 nations at the Aquatics Centre, after finishing first in the technical routine on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They came back only fourth in the free routine, but the combined score of 566.4783 points was still enough to be crowned champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain's Kate Shortman and Isabelle Thorpe won silver at nearly eight points adrift, while the Dutch twins of Bregje and Noortje de Brouwer rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result marked a perfect ending for China, who already struck gold in the team event on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national artistic swimming team were runners-up in both events in the past two Games, losing to Russia on all four occasions. But the defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the country's conflict with Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the Wang sisters will return to school next month, having already been admitted to the Education University of Hong Kong's Doctor of Education (Chinese prospective) programme.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jonny Evans gave City the chance to win it when he skied his spot kick. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765683_1_20240811024639.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City avenged their FA Cup final defeat to Manchester United to lift the Community Shield 7-6 on penalties on Saturday, after a 1-1 draw at Wembley.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The game exploded into life in the final 10 minutes as Alejandro Garnacho gave United the lead before Bernardo Silva levelled in the 89th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's men then edged a marathon shoot-out as Jadon Sancho and Jonny Evans failed to score for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City have won the Premier League for a record four consecutive seasons but it is the first time in that run that they have won the season opener after defeats to Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal in the past three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The English champions were severely hampered by the absence of a series of key players due to their late return to pre-season after competing at Euro 2024 and the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City's England trio of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Phil Foden, as well as Spain midfielder Rodri are yet to return to training following their efforts in reaching the final of Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, United boss Erik ten Hag showed his desperation to win more silverware by thrusting teenager Kobbie Mainoo straight back into the heart of the action after his starring role for England in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite also leaving Kevin De Bruyne and Silva on the bench, City controlled the game early on with the electric Jeremy Doku causing havoc down the left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James McAtee could be handed his chance to shine this season by Pep Guardiola with Julian Alvarez set to join Atletico Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And McAtee, who spent last season on loan at Sheffield United, was inches away from making his mark with a curling effort that came back off the post midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's job is widely believed to have been saved by beating City back in May and he will feel his side should have got the better of their rivals once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United were being starved of possession but still managed to create the better of the chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo should have gone for goal himself rather than trying to square to Bruno Fernandes with the goal gaping as half-time approached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandes started in an unfamiliar centre-forward role due to the absence of Rasmus Hojlund through injury and a lack of match fitness for Joshua Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United captain thought he had opened the scoring with a stunning strike on the hour mark that was ruled out for offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho was introduced for the final half-hour and brought more pace and invention to the United attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentine teed up Marcus Rashford, who could only hit the post with just Ederson to beat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho thought he had won the game on 82 minutes as he jinked inside the City defence and fired low into the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, City rallied and levelled in the final minute of the 90 when Oscar Bobb's cross was headed in by Silva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Portuguese midfielder was then the first to miss in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Andre Onana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, though, experienced more penalty woe at Wembley after missing in the final of Euro 2020 for England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His spot-kick was brilliantly saved by Ederson, who then fired in himself to keep City alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evans gave City the chance to win it when he blazed over.

 The US women's football team won its fifth Olympic gold medal by beating Brazil 1-0 on Mallory Swanson’s early second-half goal in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Americans, who hadn't won gold since the 2012 London Olympics, closed out an undefeated run to the title in their first international campaign under new coach Emma Hayes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher preserved the win with a one-handed save on Adriana’s header in stoppage time at Parc des Princes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss is more heartbreak for Brazil and its iconic star, Marta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The six-time world player of the year has never won a Women’s World Cup or an Olympics. This is expected to be her last major international tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the third victory for the United States over Brazil in an Olympic final. The Americans also beat the Brazilians in the 2004 in Athens and four years later in Beijing.

  <br/>
  Brazil has never finished better than runner up at the Olympics.
