<div class="itemFullText">
 Boston's Jarren Duran, the All-Star MVP, hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the fifth inning as the American League beat the National League 5-3 on Tuesday night for its 10th win in the past 11 All-Star Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes pitched a hitless first for the NL, twice hitting 100mph, and Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run homer in the third for a 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Juan Soto hit a two-run double and scored on David Fry's single to tie the score in the third, and Duran went deep off Cincinnati's Hunter Greene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duran is the fifth Boston player to be an All-Star MVP, the first since J.D. Drew in 2008. The others were Pedro Martinez in 1999, Roger Clemens in 1986 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. (AP)

    Nadal triumphs in first singles match since May

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nadal celebrates after his victory against Sweden's Leo Borg. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761891_1_20240717084121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal swept past Leo Borg, son of tennis great Bjorn Borg, to advance to the second round of the Bastad Open on Tuesday as he builds towards the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was Nadal's first singles match since the 38-year-old fell in the opening round at Roland Garros on May 27, and he eased to a 6-3, 6-4 win in wet conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Nadal and the 21-year-old Borg, currently ranked 461st in the world, were wild card entries to the Swedish clay-court tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an early scare with the former world number one slipping on the wet white line, Nadal broke for 3-1, hitting four aces to take the first set in 43 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An immediate break gave the Spaniard a foothold in the second, sealing the match on his second match point after 1hr 25min on court for his eighth ATP tour match win this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's good, I'm finally defending my title," joked Nadal, who has not played in Bastad since winning the title aged 19 in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't been playing a lot of tennis in the last few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even in the tougher moments, I have been able to keep going with the help of the team, but of course the fans have a huge impact on that. They give me amazing energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam winner praised his rival, the son of the long-retired former world number one Bjorn Borg, now 68.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a huge honour to play against the son of one of the biggest legends in the history of our sport," said Nadal. "I think he played quite well, he has a great future in front. I wish him all the very best." (AFP)

    Real Madrid officially unveil Kylian Mbappé

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé finally put on a Real Madrid jersey on Tuesday, fulfilling his childhood dream in front of a packed Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 80,000 fans were in hand at the Bernabeu to welcome the 25-year-old France star during his official presentation as the club's newest player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After signing his five-year contract with the Spanish powerhouse alongside club president Florentino Pérez, Mbappé entered the stage set up at the Bernabeu to loud cheers by the Madrid fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wearing the No. 9 jersey, Mbappé smiled broadly and waved to the fans who chanted his name, then embraced Pérez and former Madrid player and coach Zinedine Zidane, who invited Mbappé to visit the Spanish club for the first time when he was just a teenager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's an incredible day for me," Mbappé told the crowd, in good Spanish. ”Since being a kid I dreamed about playing for Madrid and today I'm here. It means a lot to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé finished his speech by asking the crowd to join him and chant “Hala Madrid,” similar to what his childhood idol – and “now friend” – Cristiano Ronaldo did when he arrived at the club. Mbappé then kissed the club’s shield and went around the Bernabeu kicking balls to the crowd in the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now I have another dream, which is to live up to the history of this club, the best club in the world,” he said. “I’ll give my life to this club and to this shield.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record 15 European Cups won by Madrid were on display on the stage where Mbappé was introduced. His relatives, club officials and several former players were also by the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I see my family happy, I see my mother crying,” said Mbappé, who earlier Tuesday underwent his physical with Madrid's doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The message “Welcome, Mbappé” was shown on the large video boards at the newly revamped Bernabeu, which had its roof closed for the midday ceremony in the Spanish capital. (AP)

    Gareth Southgate resigns as England manager

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After eight years, four major tournaments and two finals, Gareth Southgate announced he was stepping down as England manager on Tuesday, saying it was “time for change.”
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunday’s 2-1 loss to Spain in the European Championship final proved to be his last game in charge of the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As a proud Englishman, it has been the honor of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all,” he said. “But it’s time for change, and for a new chapter.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate’s contract was due to expire this year and his announcement comes after months of uncertainty surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Oyarzabal’s 86th-minute winner in Berlin was a painful way to end his reign after he transformed the fortunes of England’s underperforming national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hired in 2016, he led England to back-to-back finals at the Euros and to the semifinals of the World Cup in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, ultimately, he was unable to end the nation’s decades-long wait for a first major trophy since the World Cup in 1966. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's Thomas Müller has called time on his 14-year international career after their European Championship exit, the Bayern Munich forward said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old featured in his eighth and last tournament on July 5, in Germany's 2-1 quarter-final defeat by Spain, where he was brought on as a substitute in the 80th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Müller helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup and has the third most appearances for the national team with 131 caps and 45 goals. He also won the Golden Boot and Young Player Award during the 2010 World Cup, when Germany finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It always made me very proud to play for my country. We celebrated together and sometimes shed a tear together," Müller said in a farewell video on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I had the privilege of making my first international appearance, I would never have dreamed of all this. I would like to say thank you to all the fans and my Germany teammates for their support over the years. Take the enthusiasm and joy of this year's Euros with you." (Reuters)

    Copa chaos raises concerns for 2026 World Cup

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans rush the gates before the Copa America final at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, Florida. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761747_1_20240716082151.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chaotic scenes at the Copa America final have raised serious questions for the organisers of the 2026 World Cup which will be held in North America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The start of Sunday's final between Colombia and Argentina at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium was delayed by 82 minutes as overwhelmed security struggled to process the safe entry fans into the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers blamed ticketless fans for rushing the entry points into the venue for their decision to keep the gates closed for almost three hours after the planned opening time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, while there was plenty of evidence of ticketless fans entering, it was also clear that the security system was unable to cope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some fans needed medical attention for heat exhaustion after being stuck in the crush around the fencing at the entrance to the 65,000 capacity venue amid alarming scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hard Rock Stadium will host seven games at the 2026 World Cup which the USA is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Copa America was organised by South American confederation CONMEBOL while the World Cup will be controlled by global governing body FIFA and it's local organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not a good look," said former USA international Alexi Lalas, now a leading television pundit for Fox Sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand this is not a good look for CONMEBOL and this is also, because it is happening on our watch, in our country, not a good look for the US less than two years out from the World Cup," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA, who had no role in the running of the Copa, did not immediately comment on the incidents but sources indicated they would now intensify discussions with stadiums over their security plans. (AFP)

 Thousands of people in Madrid welcomed Spain's squad home on Monday after they beat England to win Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After receptions with King Felipe VI and prime minister Pedro Sanchez, La Roja were paraded through the capital city on an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was adorned with the message "it's only the beginning" and the trophy sat at the front of the bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want a lot," Sanchez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want more," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The likes of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Sunday's match-winner in Berlin, Mikel Oyarzabal, wore white t-shirts with the number four on them in reference to the record number of times Spain have won the European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For now, we're not realising yet what we have accomplished," Williams said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacker, who scored the opening goal of the 2-1 victory, was also eager to thank Spain's fans "for the love and warmth they brought the team".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team bus took them to Plaza Cibeles in central Madrid where thousands more fans waited to celebrate the success, following on from victories in 1964, 2008 and 2012. (AFP)

 A goal in the depths of extra time gave handed a record 16th Copa America title to Argentina who prevailed over Colombia in a closely-fought final in Miami.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun is looking to take part in his second Olympics next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clinched gold in men's single sculls in the lightweight category of the World Rowing Cup in May, which involved athletes weighing no more than 72.5 kilogrammes. Now, he's taking on a whole new challenge by participating in the open category in the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu told RTHK he's adopting a new strategy that he believes will better prepare him against the "real giants".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina captain Lionel Messi hopes forward Angel Di Maria ends his international career with a goal in Sunday's Copa America final against Colombia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Di Maria, 36, announced in November his plans to retire from internationals after representing his country for 15 years and Messi wants him to get his name on the scoresheet as he did against Brazil to clinch the continental title in 2021 and against France as they won the 2022 World Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe he'll score another goal in the final like he did in all the previous ones he's played in. It would be extraordinary," Messi said in an interview with Direct TV Sports, adding that the team still hopes he will reverse his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always tell him that if everything goes well, we have playoff games coming up. Nevertheless, 'Fideo' (Di Maria) has made up his mind and there's nothing that can change it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Di Maria has scored 31 goals in 144 appearances for Argentina, having played in six Copa Americas and four World Cups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also struck the winner in Argentina's 1-0 victory over Nigeria to win Olympic gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. (Reuters)

    Alcaraz dominates Djokovic to retain Wimbledon crown

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761579_1_20240715044720.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz overpowered seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets to retain his Wimbledon title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish third seed produced a performance combining awesome power with delicate touch to win 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/4), collecting the fourth Grand Slam of his young career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz equals the Open Era record for most Grand Slams won at the age 21 or under, joining Boris Becker, Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he is just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, who had knee surgery just weeks ago, was aiming to win a 25th Grand Slam - which would have been a record in the men's and women's game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he had no answers in the Centre Court sunshine as the electric Alcaraz pounded him from the back of the court and treated the crowd to an array of his trademark drop shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly, it is a dream for me winning this trophy," said the Spaniard. "I did an interview when I was 11 and I said my dream is to win Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me this is the most beautiful tournament, the most beautiful court and the most beautiful trophy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz paid tribute to his beaten opponent, who only found his range in the third set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Djokovic is an unbelievable fighter, I knew he was going to have his chances," said Alcaraz who had needed five sets to defeat the Serb in the 2023 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was difficult but I tried to stay calm going into the tie-break and tried to play my best tennis. I was glad at the end I could find the solutions."(AFP)

    Last-gasp drop goal lifts Ireland over Springboks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland toppled rugby world champions South Africa 25-24 with a drop goal by Ciaran Frawley in the last second of a ferocious body-smashing contest at Kings Park on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Irish rebounded from losing 27-20 last weekend in Pretoria by notching only their second ever win over the Springboks in South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It didn't look like it would happen after the Springboks came back from 16-6 down at halftime, finding another gear and forcing errors that Handre Pollard used to kick eight penalties from eight attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after falling behind 24-19 with 15 minutes to go, Ireland found the energy to pin South Africa in their 22. They waived off a penalty kick to go for a try and squandered a tapped penalty. But, out of nowhere, replacement flyhalf Frawley lined up a 42-metre drop goal in the 70th minute to keep them in touch at 25-22 behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irish, playing their 15th and last test of a super-long Rugby World Cup season, rallied yet again and, as the match clock ticked into the red, Frawley let fly with another drop goal from the same length as the first and won a gripping match and squared a classic series. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wales' Rio Dyer dives in to score a try in the corner and set up a tense finale. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761485_1_20240714011612.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A resurgent Wallabies earned their first back-to-back rugby Test wins since 2021 on Saturday with a hard-fought 36-28 victory over Wales, who extended their horror run to nine straight defeats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Filipo Daugunu scored twice with Jake Gordon and Allan Alaalatoa also crossing on a wet and cold Melbourne night to back up their 25-16 triumph in Sydney a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took a 23-14 lead into the break and withstood intense second-half pressure and a series of handling errors to seal the series 2-0 and give new coach Joe Schmidt the second win of his tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was tough, bit of relief at the end there," said Wallabies skipper James Slipper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was scrappy from us for sure, it wasn't our best game, but we got the result. There's plenty to work on though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are gritty, they hang in there, they played our kicking game really well tonight," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat piled more pain on Warren Gatland's team which is now one loss away from equalling Wales' all-time record of 10 consecutive defeats, which came in 2002 and 2003 under another New Zealander, Steve Hansen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have slumped to 11th in the world rankings, below Fiji and Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite clawing back from 17-0 down after 25 minutes, they paid the price for conceding too many penalties and again lost the breakdown battle, sorely missing injured workhorse No 8 Aaron Wainwright.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We never gave up, we had a never-say-die attitude," said Wales captain Dewi Lake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But obviously we are a young team and we don't have enough experience really at Test level. What matters is results and we are not giving ourselves those at the moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taine Plumtree assumed Wainwright's role in the back row with James Botham, grandson of England cricket great Ian Botham, starting at blindside flanker and Tommy Reffell at openside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they were immediately exposed as Australia scored inside seven minutes with a move that started from near their own try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under pressure, wing Andrew Kellaway sidestepped the Welsh defence then collected his own chip before offloading to a charging Fraser McReight who powered up the field and found Daugunu to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the rain hammering down, they kept the pressure on with Lolesio making it 10-0 off the tee with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu made a try-saving tackle on Botham as Wales warmed to the task, but it was Australia who scored once more against the run of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scrum-half Gordon sent up a box kick and a handling error from fullback Cam Winnett allowed him to collect it and weave past two defenders to the try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undeterred, a well-worked rolling maul from the lineout saw Lake muscle over to get Wales on the board after half-an-hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Australia's Lukhan Salakaia-Loto in the sin-bin he repeated the feat soon afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both tries were converted to get Wales back in the game at 20-14 and an early converted try to veteran winger Liam Williams in the second-half put the Wallabies on notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the hosts proved they too could work a rolling maul, with Alaalatoa powering over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu got his second after a schoolboy error from Williams, who tried to keep the ball in play from a Wallabies kick, only to palm it perfectly to a charging Daugunu who surged to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Australia a 33-21 lead, but they went to sleep and Wales winger Rio Dyer smashed over in the corner to set up a tense finale. (AFP)

 Tadej Pogacar extended his overall lead on the Tour de France when he won stage 14 in the Pyrenees on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His arch rival Jonas Vingegaard came second at 39sec while Remco Evenepoel was third at 1min 10sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of another monster run in the Pyrenees on Sunday, Pogacar extended his lead to 1min 57sec over Vingegaard as Evenepoel dropped to third at 2min 22sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar's team UAE waited until the third and final climb of the day before sending Adam Yates on an attack that the Slovenian would soon join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Pogacar unleashed a ferocious acceleration, his two podium rivals followed, but were either unwilling or unable to match the pace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the final section of a climb, packed on either side by raucous fans, 2020 and 2021 champion Pogacar extended his lead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Barbora Krejcikova won Wimbledon for her second Grand Slam title with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 victory over Jasmine Paolini in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is a 28-year-old from the Czech Republic who adds this trophy to her championship at the French Open in 2021 .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was unseeded in Paris back then and was only the 31st of 32 seeds at the All England Club after illness and a back injury this season limited her to a 7-9 record entering this tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is the eighth woman to leave Wimbledon as the champion in the past eight editions of the event. Last year's champion is also from the Czech Republic: unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, who lost in the first round last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seventh-seeded Paolini was the runner-up at the French Open last month and is the first woman since Serena Williams in 2016 to get to the finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same season. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New Zealand hung on to beat England after two tries from Mark Tele'a. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761467_1_20240713204131.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wing Mark Tele'a scored two tries on Saturday as New Zealand squeezed past England 24-17 to win a hard-fought second rugby Test in Auckland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tele'a touched down either side of half-time as the All Blacks took the series 2-0 and extended their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just like in the 16-15 first Test win at Dunedin, New Zealand had to wrestle back the lead in the second half from a spirited England side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hugely proud of the boys to hold on and win the arm wrestle and finish off a good performance," said New Zealand captain Scott Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Test matches certainly challenge your character and we had to dig deep there, right till the last minute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Marcus Smith led the visitors to a 14-13 advantage at half-time after his pin-point cross-field kicks created tries for wing Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a breathless opening spell, the All Blacks took the lead when Tele'a caught the England defence napping from a ruck to dart over for a try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All Blacks fly-half Damian McKenzie landed the conversion, but England immediately hit back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith kicked wide into the arms of Feyi-Waboso, who stepped inside the defence for a converted try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand should have had a second try when Tele'a broke away, but Smith intercepted the final pass to Stephen Perofeta on the England tryline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed a penalty, but Smith quickly took the kick-off to pin the All Blacks deep in their own half, where they stayed for the next 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie stroked over another penalty, but England led at half-time after Freeman outleapt Tele'a to haul in Smith's kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England number 10 successfully converted from the touchline .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England started the second-half camped in the All Blacks half and Smith extended the lead to 17-13 with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half an hour left, scrum-half Cortez Ratima came on to make his All Blacks debut when he replaced the dazed Finlay Christie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game's momentum swung New Zealand's way when the All Blacks brought on Beauden Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The twice world player of the year showed his class by restoring the lead for New Zealand when he scythed through a gap to put Tele'a over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie missed the conversion, but landed two penalties to pull New Zealand out of England's reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors fought until the end with England captain Jamie George denied near the New Zealand line from scoring a potential match-levelling try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're a significantly better team than we when we started," said England captain George.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's hugely exciting times ahead for this English team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll welcome them to Twickenham in November, we'll look forward to that." (AFP)

    Djokovic, Alcaraz to clash again in Wimbledon final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At 37, Novak Djokovic can become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he beats Carlos Alcaraz this time around. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761398_1_20240713031711.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic swept past Lorenzo Musetti on Friday to book a second successive Wimbledon final against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and move one win away from a record-setting 25th Grand Slam title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just five weeks after undergoing knee surgery, seven-time Wimbledon champion Djokovic reached his 10th final at the All England Club with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 win over the Italian 25th seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz earlier defeated Daniil Medvedev 6-7 (1/7), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach a fourth Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, can equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles and become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he avenges last year's dramatic five-set final loss to Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time Djokovic and Musetti met was at the French Open in June when the Serb claimed victory in a third round tie which ended at 3:07 in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, however, Djokovic was untroubled on his way to a 37th Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He broke for 4-2 lead in the opener and, despite surrendering the advantage and letting two set points slip in the ninth game, he broke again in the 10th to claim the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second seed was playing in his 49th Grand Slam semi-final while the 22-year-old Musetti was in his first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That experience was key as Djokovic hit back from losing serve in the opening game of the second set to level in the sixth before dominating the tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A break in the opening game of the third set launched him on his way to victory against a demoralised Musetti, who at least had the consolation of saving three match points before Djokovic completed his progress to yet another Wimbledon final. (AFP)

    England great Anderson ends Test career on a high

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"Playing for England is the best job in the world" said James Anderson. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761389_1_20240713002102.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England great James Anderson said he felt "really proud" after bringing down the curtain on a remarkable Test career with a thumping win over the West Indies at Lord's.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His final appearance before international retirement saw the 41-year-old paceman take a typically frugal 3-32 in 16 overs as the West Indies were dismissed for just 136 on Friday to give England victory by an innings and 114 runs inside three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England selectors had already agreed with Anderson that this first of a three-match series would represent his farewell to national on-field service as they look to rebuild ahead of the 2025/26 Ashes series in Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anderson, now set to mentor England's quicks for the rest of the season, bowed out with a remarkable 704 wickets from 188 Tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only spinners Shane Warne (708 Test wickets) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800) have enjoyed more bowling success at this level, with India batting hero Sachin Tendulkar (200 matches) the lone cricketer to have played more Tests than Anderson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been quite an amazing week," Anderson told Sky Sports. "I've been overwhelmed with the reaction of the crowd and everyone around the ground, and the lads as well. I'm just proud of what I've achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously this morning was quite emotional with the two teams lined up, and the reaction from the crowd was pretty special. I'm still trying to hold them (tears) back now but I think I am just really proud," added Anderson after ending his Test career where it started – with a debut against Zimbabwe at Lord's in 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for 20-odd years is an incredible effort, especially for a fast bowler, so I'm just happy that I've made it this far, happy that I've been lucky enough to stay injury-free pretty much throughout my career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for England is the best job in the world and I've been privileged to do it for a long time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England captain Ben Stokes hailed Anderson by saying: "He has just been an incredible inspiration to so many people...The amount of games and the amount of wickets he's taken are just absolutely phenomenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes you can be lost for words but if you gave me 15 minutes I wouldn't be able to compliment him enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a sense of a torch being passed at Lord's, with debutant fast bowler Gus Atkinson named player of the match following a sensational haul of 12-106.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By taking 12 wickets in his first Test, he managed something Anderson was unable to achieve in 188, with the Lancashire swing specialist's best match return at this level 11-71 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an incredible week," said Atkinson. "I just want to say thanks to Jimmy. Playing here in his last Test has been incredible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Surrey quick, asked if he had idolised Anderson as a child, replied: "A hundred percent. Growing up Jimmy was someone I would come to Lord's and watch. I was standing at mid-off thinking I had seen that so many times on the TV. It was amazing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite summed up many an opposition batsman's view of Anderson by saying: "He is a legend of the game. I won't miss him at all!" (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory over the final straight on Thursday to complete Stage 12 of the Tour de France in Villeneuve-sur-Lot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Girmay of Eritrea outlasted Wout van Aert of Belgium and Arnaud Demare of France to finish in 4 hours, 17 minutes, 15 seconds and capture his third stage of the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Ackermann of Germany ended up in third after Demare was demoted to 67th place for pushing van Aert to the barriers during the 204-km stage that brought riders from Aurillac to Villeneuve-sur-Lot in southwestern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time Grand Tour champion Primoz Roglic of Slovenia was involved in his second crash in as many days, with Thursday's slip-up coming near the finish line. Roglic finished 2:27 after Girmay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, there were no changes atop the leaderboard. Two-time Tour champion Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia retained the yellow jersey, 1:06 ahead of Belgium's Remco Evenepoel and 1:14 ahead of two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark.

    Krejcikova stuns Rybakina, faces Paolini in final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Barbora Krejcikova celebrates after beating Elena Rybakina on Centre Court at Wimbledon. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761246_1_20240712035538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in the Wimbledon final after battling back for a shock 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over former champion Elena Rybakina on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just hours after Paolini beat tearful Croatian Donna Vekic 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10/8) in the longest ever women's semi-final at the All England Club, it was Krejcikova's turn to dig deep for victory against fourth seeded Rybakina in two hours and seven minutes on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova faces seventh seed Paolini on Saturday in what will be the second Grand Slam final of the 28-year-old's career after her French Open triumph in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud about my game and my fighting spirit today," said Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech started 2024 with a run to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, but a first round exit at the French Open was a major setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She struggled with a back injury and illness, winning just three singles matches in the five months before finally finding her form in remarkable style at Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova shocked 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round and former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals, before turning her sights on Rybakina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-time Wimbledon doubles champion is now one win away from an unexpected triumph in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unbelievable. It is very tough to explain, but a lot of joy and a lot of emotions," Krejcikova said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I broke her in the second set, I started to be in the zone and I didn't want to leave the zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rybakina had been in formidable form, dropping just one set as she extended her impressive All England Club record to 19 wins from 21 matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old, who won Wimbledon in 2022, made a fast start with two quick breaks for an early 4-0 lead in a one-sided first set against Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her first Wimbledon semi-final, Krejcikova turned the tide in the second set, landing a priceless break in the sixth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She levelled the match on her sixth set point, making it the first time in 20 years that both Wimbledon women's semi-finals had gone to the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech held all the momentum and she eventually wore down Rybakina, who had committed over 35 unforced errors by the time she surrendered her serve in the decisive, seventh game of the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini had never won a main draw match at Wimbledon before this year, but the world number seven tenaciously saw off Vekic in two hours and 51 minutes to secure a second successive Grand Slam final appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old, who lost the French Open final to Iga Swiatek last month, is the first Italian woman to reach the Wimbledon final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini, who also made the Australia Open last 16 in January, had not gone past the second round in any Slam before this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without a win at the All England Club heading into the tournament, Paolini now has six victories under her belt and has dropped just two sets in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last months have been crazy for me. It is a dream. I was watching finals when I was a kid on this Wimbledon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know there is no place better than here to fight for every ball and every point. I will remember this forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vekic paid the price for 57 unforced errors, with the semi-final fittingly ending on another wild forehand from the unseeded Croatian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unable to contain her frustration at letting 3-1 and 4-3 leads slip in the last set, Vekic broke down in tears in the closing stages of a rollercoaster clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was crying because I had so much pain. I didn't know how I could keep playing," Vekic said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I was going to die in the third set. I had so much pain in my arm, in my leg." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uruguay's Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia went down to 10 men just before half-time when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ollie Watkins struck a stunning injury-time winner as England beat the Netherlands 2-1 on Wednesday to set up a Euro 2024 final showdown with Spain in Berlin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an incredible finish to an evening that began badly for England, as Xavi Simons gave the Netherlands an early lead in the semi-final in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, England were soon level through a Harry Kane penalty following a contentious VAR call by German referee Felix Zwayer, and the match looked set for extra time until Watkins struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On for Kane, Watkins received a pass from fellow substitute Cole Palmer with his back to goal in the first minute of stoppage time, turned and fired low into the far corner to leave the Netherlands bewildered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm lost for words really," said Watkins, the Aston Villa striker. "I don't think I've hit a ball that sweet before, and obviously in such a special moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has rarely been a convincing campaign from Gareth Southgate's England side, but they are through to their second consecutive European Championship final as they dream of finally winning a first major trophy since 1966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To do that they will surely have to perform better than at any point so far in Germany as they face an outstanding Spain team, who beat France 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands had been hoping to repeat their triumph at the last Euros in Germany, in 1988, but their current side lacks anyone with the star quality of Marco van Basten or Ruud Gullit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A victory for them would have seen this Euros conclude with the same final as the 2010 World Cup. Instead they now go home. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) on Wednesday formally named a star-studded 592-member team for this month's Olympic Games in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US squad, which is comprised of 314 female athletes and 278 male athletes, will be aiming to top the Olympic medal table for a fourth straight games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team includes Olympic stars such as gymnast Simone Biles, swimmer Katie Ledecky and NBA icon LeBron James.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with immense pride and excitement that we announce the 2024 US Olympic Team and the exceptional athletes that embody the spirit of dedication, resilience, and excellence, continuing the proud history of Team USA at the Olympic Games," USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US team includes more than 250 returning Olympians, including three five-time Olympians, four four-time Olympians and 16 three-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The squad includes 122 Olympic medallists, including 66 Olympic champions who boast a combined 110 gold medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forty-five athletes on the team have won multiple Olympic medals, while 23 have won multiple Olympic golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The youngest member of the team is gymnast Hezly Rivera, who turned 16 on June 4, while the oldest member of the squad is equestrian Steffen Peters, the 59-year-old German-born rider who first represented the United States at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. (AFP)

    Musetti through to semi-final, Djokovic gets free pass
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Musetti celebrates after winning his quarter-final match against Taylor Fritz. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761090_2_20240711081337.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lorenzo Musetti threw his head back and spread his arms wide to celebrate reaching his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon, then covered his face with both hands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25th-seeded Musetti, a 22-year-old from Italy, never had made it past the third round at the All England Club – or past the fourth round at any major tournament – until this fortnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He defeated 13th-seeded American Taylor Fritz 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, though, comes a far tougher test – taking on Novak Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic earlier progressed to a record-equalling 13th Wimbledon semi-final without hitting a ball on Wednesday after Alex de Minaur pulled out injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian ninth seed De Minaur, 25, announced shortly after midday at the All England Club that he was "devastated to pull out due to a hip injury."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means Djokovic has now equalled Roger Federer's men's record of 13 semi-final appearances at Wimbledon as he closes on the Swiss great's mark of eight singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Serbian is also through to a record-extending 49th men's Grand Slam semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Minaur, who beat Djokovic at the United Cup in January, said: "It's no secret that this would have been the biggest match of my career but it's a unique injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I woke up this morning wanting to feel some sort of miracle, but there was a high risk of making the injury worse if I stepped on court. One stretch, one slide could take this from a three to six weeks' injury to four months out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a historic 25th Grand Slam triumph is coming into sharp focus for Djokovic, who demolished Holger Rune in straight sets in the fourth round on Tuesday. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi was on target as 2022 world champions Argentina turned on the style to beat Canada 2-0 on Tuesday and reach the Copa America final where they will look for a third straight major title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-times Copa champions produced their best display of the tournament in front of a capacity crowd at the 82,500 MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina soaked up some early pressure before Julian Alvarez ghosted in between two defenders to open the scoring with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Messi had chances throughout the match and doubled the lead in the 51st minute when he stuck out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The truth is that it's crazy what this group has done, what the Argentina national team has been doing," Messi told TyC Sports after his first goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not easy for us to be in a final again, for us to compete again to be champions. I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum," said the 37-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defending Copa champions will face the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Uruguay and Colombia in what will be a highly anticipated final in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit," said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight," he added. (Agencies)

    Alcaraz, Medvedev set up semi-final repeat, Sinner out

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and Daniil Medvedev set up a Wimbledon semi-final repeat on Tuesday, while Daniil Medvedev defeated world number one Jannik Sinner to reach a second successive Wimbledon final four.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz battled back from a set down to defeat Tommy Paul 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 while Medvedev stunned world number one Jannik Sinner, who suffered a mid-match health scare, 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish world number three Alcaraz, seeking a fourth Grand Slam title, was broken twice by 12th-seeded Paul in a 72-minute first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three breaks in the third set put the Spaniard in charge and he stepped up another gear in the fourth, making just four unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, seeking to become just the sixth man to capture the French Open and Wimbledon titles back to back, defeated Medvedev in straights sets in last year's Wimbledon semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniil Medvedev defeated world number one Jannik Sinner in five sets on Tuesday to reach a second successive Wimbledon semi-final, subduing the gallant challenge of the Italian, who suffered a worrying mid-match health scare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth-ranked Medvedev triumphed 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 6-3 to avenge his Australian Open final loss to Sinner in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His four-hour victory also ended a five-match losing streak against the Italian as Medvedev reached his ninth Grand Slam semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a tight first set in which neither man gave up a break point, Medvedev edged ahead in the tie-break on the back of a lung-busting 33-shot rally. However, he squandered a set point and his game suddenly fell apart, serving up a double fault as Sinner pocketed the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mercurial Russian carved out the only break of the second set in the third game on his way to levelling the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner slipped another break down at 2-1 in the third set and immediately summoned the tournament physio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian, appearing distressed, had his blood pressure taken courtside before he left for a medical time-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a 10-minute delay, the 22-year-old resumed play and thrilled the Centre Court crowd when he bravely clawed his way back to 5-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Italian was undaunted and levelled the quarter-final on the back of breaks in the third and fifth games of the fourth set. But it was Medvedev finished the fresher of the two players, breaking in the final set on his way to victory. (AFP)

    Yamal makes history as Spain reach Euro 2024 final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Yamal becomes the youngest-ever scorer in a European Championship. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760947_1_20240710062439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain struck twice in five minutes in a pulsating first half to secure a 2-1 comeback win over France on Tuesday as a record-breaking goal from teenager Lamine Yamal and a Dani Olmo effort propelled them into the Euro 2024 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani's opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, confirmed their favourites tag with another display of attacking football, especially in the first half, that is a far cry from the tiki-taka passing game that earned them world and European titles more than a decade ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will now face the winners of Wednesday's match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a anti-climactic end to France's tournament, although the 2022 World Cup finalists never lived up to expectations in Germany with a very low conversion rate that carried into the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was deflected in by France's Jules Kounde.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they could not carve out an equaliser with Spain, pulling back and successfully soaking up the pressure. (Reuters)

    Ex-Liverpool striker Bellamy appointed Wales manager

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Craig Bellamy says he is keen to get started with their Nations League games. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760928_1_20240710003437.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Craig Bellamy has been appointed as the new head coach of the Wales national football team on a contract until 2028, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bellamy has replaced Rob Page, who was sacked following Wales' failure to qualify for Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 44-year-old former Liverpool, Newcastle and Wales striker leaves Burnley, where he was assistant to former manager Vincent Kompany last season as they were relegated from the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will give my full commitment to develop this team and I am passionate to bring continued success into Welsh football," Bellamy told the FAW website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't wait to get started with our Nations League games in September."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FAW's chief football officer, Dr David Adams, said: "I am absolutely delighted to announce Craig as our new head coach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We undertook a thorough recruitment process for the new men's national team head coach and Craig was identified as the standout candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are all looking forward to the Nations League games and working with Craig to deliver success for Welsh Football."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burnley chairman Alan Pace added: "I want to thank Craig for all his hard work during his time at Burnley and wish him the best for his new position as Wales manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Craig has been a very important part of our wonderful journey the last two years. I've admired his leadership, knowledge and passion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Page guided Wales to their first World Cup in 64 years in 2022 and to the second round of Euro 2020 but failed to reach this year's Euros, losing in a penalty shoot-out to Poland in a play-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he subsequently oversaw one of the most embarrassing results in Wales' history, a 0-0 draw with Gibraltar in a friendly and then suffered a 4-0 hammering at the hands of Slovakia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wales' next game is the opening match of their Nations League campaign against Turkey on September 6, with a trip to Montenegro three days later. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday held a flag presentation ceremony for the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics ahead of the start of the Games later this month, with Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan announcing higher rewards to further motivate athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I’m glad to learn about the Jockey Club Athlete Incentive Awards Scheme, which will increase the reward for athletes. There will be a 20 percent increase in cash incentives in total compared with the last Olympics. For example, the reward for an individual gold medallist will be raised to HK$6 million. This is a great way to motivate our athletes to strive for better results,” he said at the ceremony at the government headquarters in Tamar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also revealed that due to the rising temperatures in Paris, the administration plans to provide air conditioners for athletes competing there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The order's been placed, the equipment's on its way… I'm going there on July 22nd, and I anticipate that all our rooms [will] have the air conditioning,” said Brian Stevenson, Chef de Mission for the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending a delegation of about 90 people to Paris. Among them are 35 athletes, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Épée fencer Vivian Kong, who narrowly missed out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is now heading to Paris as the world number one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said her mindset has changed since the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the biggest difference between these three years is that Tokyo gave me a lot of time to reflect on why I want to train, why I want to become better, why I want to win, because it doesn't seem to matter if people aren't healthy, if people aren't happy. There are more important things than sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think this time in Paris we can really enjoy sports... Hopefully everyone's healthy again and that it gives more purpose and motivation for me to do well.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For veteran swimmer Camille Cheng, this will be her third Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her family will be in Paris to see her in action in the Games for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think about this time of the season as really the fun part of the season. We've put in the hard work. It's all about the small details, fine-tuning things, focusing on recovery," Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And really, I think more than anything, it's about mentally so that you're in a happy place, that you're surrounded by positive energy... because for me I believe that a happy swimmer is a fast swimmer.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sprinter Felix Diu made the final cut to the Olympics through a wild-card. The 100m specialist and first-time Olympian said his goal is to achieve a personal best at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My expectation for the Olympics is to get a [personal best time] for like 10.3 or 10.2 seconds,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Wai-fung, another Olympic debutant, secured Hong Kong's first-ever Taekwondo Olympic qualification. While excited about that, he said he feels the pressure of representing all the Taekwondo enthusiasts in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes to bring home a medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics will be held from July 26 to August 11.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic accused Wimbledon fans of "disrespect" in a withering on-court tirade after reaching a 60th Grand Slam quarter-final and 15th at the All England Club on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World number two Djokovic, the seven-time champion at Wimbledon and chasing a record-setting 25th major, defeated 15th-ranked Holger Rune 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic then launched a bitter outburst at a section of Centre Court fans who constantly chanted "Rune" throughout the match, echoing the shouts of "Root", popularised by cricket fans in the country in support of former England cricket skipper Joe Root.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To all the fans that have had respect and stayed here tonight, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I appreciate it," said an angry Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And to all those people that have chosen to disrespect the player–in this case me – have a goooooooood night," he added, mocking his tormentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When told by the TV interviewer that some fans were shouting "Rune" rather than booing, Djokovic hit back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were. They were. I am not accepting it. No no no. I know they were cheering for Rune but that's an excuse to also boo," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Listen, I have been on the tour for more than 20 years. I know all the tricks. I focus on the respectful people that pay for the ticket, and love tennis and appreciate the players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have played in much more hostile environments, trust me – you guys can't touch me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic goes on to face Australian ninth seed Alex de Minaur for a place in the semi-finals. (AFP)

    Alcaraz, Sinner stay on course for Wimbledon meeting

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates after his fourth round win. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760631_1_20240708075038.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Carlos Alcaraz defeated French 16th seed Ugo Humbert 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to make the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for the ninth time in just 14 appearances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, it was another uncomfortable afternoon for the Spaniard, who had needed five sets to see off Frances Tiafoe in the third round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His erratic performance on Sunday saw him drop serve five times and commit an uncharacteristic 33 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old, bidding to become just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back, eased through the first set under the Centre Court roof before crucially saving four break points in the fifth game of the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will be there, fighting until the last ball," said Alcaraz, who is chasing a fourth Grand Slam title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz will take on American 12th seed Tommy Paul, who beat Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over on Court One, top seed Sinner moved into the last-eight with a 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (11/9) win over American 14th seed Ben Shelton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner, who won his maiden Slam crown at the Australian Open this year, will face Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev for a place in the semi-finals in a rematch of their final in Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a tough match, especially the third set. I had to keep saving set points," said Sinner, a semi-finalist in 2023. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kenya's Faith Kipyegon celebrates after winning the women's 1,500m to set a new world record. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760618_1_20240708014703.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Kenyan Faith Kipyegon hit world record-breaking form at Sunday's Diamond League meet in Paris in the perfect boost before the Olympics kick off in three weeks' time in the French capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mahuchikh broke the 37-year-old women's high jump world record, while Kipyegon improved her own record in the women's 1,500m, two results that will make them two of the stars to watch in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion Mahuchikh set a new best of 2.10m, beating by 1cm the record set by Bulgaria's Stefka Kostadinova at the 1987 world championships in Rome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Coming into this competition, I had feelings that I could jump 2.07m and maybe 2.10m," said Mahuchikh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finally, I signed Ukraine into the history of world athletics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1,500m, led out by two pacemakers, two-time defending Olympic champion Kipyegon broke to the front and clocked 3min 49.04sec in a superb display of running. It improved by 0.07sec her previous best set in Florence in June 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wow this is just amazing! I am so happy to break the world record over my favourite distance again," said Kipyegon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't wait to come back to Paris to defend my Olympic title!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armand "Mondo" Duplantis went close in a bid to better his own pole vault world record in an afternoon of top-class track and field that featured a stunning men's 800m, while French decathlete Kevin Mayer took a worrying tumble in the 110m hurdles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a distinctly Olympic tinge to proceedings at a packed Stade Charlety in southern Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stadium was awash with tricolour flags, Olympic mascots and a lot of blue after organisers asked fans to come dressed in the colour to support home athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not work for decathlon world record holder Mayer, who tumbled to the ground in the hurdles, the third event of a triathlon also including the shot put and long jump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayer received medical attention before being helped off the track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In better news for the hosts, Sasha Zhoya equalled his personal best of 13.15sec to win the 110m hurdles in a photo finish from American Trey Cunningham. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lewis Hamilton held off Max Verstappen in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday for a first victory since Saudi Arabia in December 2021.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I've been waiting for this," shouted Briton Hamilton after crossing the line in his Mercedes to claim a ninth victory at Silverstone, breaking a tie with Michael Schumacher for most wins at one track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris of McLaren was third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After his record-extending 104th Formula One victory, the 39-year-old Hamilton wept as he fell into the arms of his father as the home crowd roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since 2021, every day fighting, training and putting my mind to the task, working as hard as I can," Hamilton, who will be moving to Ferrari after this season, said at the finish line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is my last race for the team here, I love them so much, I'll be forever grateful to everyone at Mercedes and to the incredible fans."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton, who started second on the grid behind his teammate George Russell, recorded his 13th consecutive podium at his home track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell, the winner a week earlier in Austria, was forced out with a hydraulic problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton overtook Russell on lap 18 but was passed by Norris two laps later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a poorly executed McLaren pit stop allowed Hamilton to regain the lead with 12 laps remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton finished 1.465sec ahead of Verstappen who overtook Norris three laps from the finish as the race ended in sunshine after a brief shower during the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's Verstappen increased his lead in the drivers' standings over Norris by three points to 84 points despite failing to win for two consecutive races for the first time since Silverstone and Austria in 2022.
  <br/>

    South Korea names Hong Myung-bo as coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong returns as South Korea coach 10 years after stepping down. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760593_1_20240707170820.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former coach and captain Hong Myung-bo will return to guide South Korea's national men's football team, the governing body said on Sunday, five months after the dismissal of Jurgen Klinsmann.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We have signed Hong as our next national team head coach," a spokesman for the Korea Football Association (KFA) told AFP, declining to give any details of Hong's contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann, a World Cup winner as a player in 1990, was dismissed after South Korea's disappointing semi-final exit from the Asian Cup in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong returns as South Korea coach 10 years after stepping down in the wake of the team's group-stage exit from the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong, 55, is celebrated as one of South Korea's greatest football players. As a defender, he captained the South to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup, which South Korea co-hosted with Japan, and scored the decisive penalty in a quarter-final shootout against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann was dismissed after only a year in the job following a 2-0 Asian Cup defeat by underdogs Jordan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just before his sacking, it emerged there had been a bust-up on the eve of the semi-final loss between Tottenham striker Son Heung-min and Lee Kang-in of Paris Saint-Germain, leaving Son with a dislocated finger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Klinsmann later said in an interview with The Athletic that he and his coaching staff were made "responsible for the fight".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The KFA's leading target to replace Klinsmann, former Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch, chose to coach Canada instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governing body also reportedly talked to Iraq's Spanish coach Jesus Casas, with 71-year-old Senol Gunes from Turkey and former Saudi Arabia coach Herve Renard also in the picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea, led by Son as captain, played the past four World Cup qualifier matches under two interim coaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong will guide the national squad through the final stages of qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, to be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An own goal by Mert Muldur completed a dramatic comeback for the Netherlands on Saturday as they overcame a tenacious Turkey 2-1 to book a Euro 2024 semi-final meeting with England.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defender bundled the ball into his own net in the 76th minute under pressure from Cody Gakpo as the Dutch bounced back from a poor first-half display to win a bruising clash and complete the final four line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stefan de Vrij had equalised only six minutes earlier after Turkey went into the break 1-0 up from Samet Akaydin’s 35th- minute header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey rode waves of passionate support at the Olympiastadion to get on course for an unlikely semi-final place but, after keeping the Dutch at bay they finally succumbed to the pressure in the last 20 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France and Spain meet in the other semi-final on Tuesday before the Dutch face England in Dortmund on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only one of the weekend’s quarter-finals to be completed without extra time or penalties was no less drama-filled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey’s goal came after a strange decision from Dutch fullback Denzel Dumfries to let a shot, which had clearly deflected off Nathan Ake, go out for a corner when he could easily have kept the ball in play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The resultant set piece was initially cleared but fell for teenager Arda Guler to deliver a perfect cross to the back post and Akaydin was first in a queue of three Turkish players to rise and head home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goal came after sustained pressure from Turkey, who had seen off early Dutch dominance, to set up several opportunities, including a succession of corners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial enterprise from the Dutch was met with tenacious defence as Turkey giving their opponents little room to play in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not help the Dutch cause that attackers Memphis Depay and Gakpo looked flat, prompting coach Ronald Koeman into throwing on pinch hitter Wout Weghorst at the start of the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the imposing centre forward looked to sew panic among the Turkish defenders, however, it was at the other end that the next opportunities arose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guler’s 56th-minute free kick was bent expertly around the Dutch wall but struck the outside of the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten minutes later, Dutch keeper Bart Verbruggen got a hand to deny Baris Alper Yilmaz’s stinging shot and Kaan Ayhan missed out on tucking away the rebound as Weghorst cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch kept plugging away and, as Turkey’s defence became more scrambled, they finally made the breakthrough with Depay’s cross finding an unmarked De Vrij to head home in the 70th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege continued and it was matter of time before the Dutch grab a second, bundled in six minutes later as Gakpo pressurised Muldur after a cross by Dumfries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tired-looking Turks, drawing last vestiges of energy from rabid support from the majority of the capacity crowd, gamely sought to take the game into extra time but had desperate efforts blocked by the Orange defence and Verbruggen made another key save in stoppage time. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barely a week after furious fans hurled beer cups and insults at Gareth Southgate, the England manager danced with his players in front of the team's supporters on Saturday after a thrilling shootout victory launched them into the Euro 2024 semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Southgate's men defeated Switzerland 5-3 on penalties after regulation ended 1-1, with Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka scoring a brilliant equalizer when he cut in from the right wing and curled a blistering 20-metre left-footed shot in off the far post following Breel Embolo's opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate's 100th game as England boss was his team's best in an uninspiring tournament that has seen the 53-year-old come under fire and speculation swirl about his future in the job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every now and then you think 'Surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job?'. So if I can't enjoy that moment, then the whole thing is a waste of time," the normally unflappable Southgate said, on letting loose to dance with his players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win put England in their third semi-final in four tournaments, where they will face either Turkey or the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I love the players, I love being in that moment with them. I took this job to try and improve English football. I wanted us to regain credibility on a world stage. So I can't deny that when it's as personal as it's been in the last few weeks on a human level, that's quite difficult," Southgate said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we're fighting. We're not going to stop fighting. And as I said, we're in another semi-final and we'll see where we can get to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka, Ivan Toney and Trent Alexander-Arnold converted from the penalty spot to clinch the win. The Liverpool defender joyously grabbed the ball as it rebounded out of the goal and booted it high into the air as his teammates hurtled forward in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were watching the (Spain-Germany) game last night and I spoke to them about it, just about playing well. Spain mixed their game up. They took seven yellow cards. They found ways to win," Southgate said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These players are showing all those other attributes, dealing with everything that's around us. Twice coming from behind in games, now a penalty shootout where their composure was impeccable. So I'm so, so proud of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've been in four (shootouts), we've won three. We got absolutely crucified for the one we lost."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate was particularly pleased for Saka, who was subjected to racial abuse after missing the decisive penalty in their Euro 2020 final loss to Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I gave him a massive cuddle on the pitch," the manager said. "He's a special boy. He's a dream to work with. Wonderful family. And, of course, you're pleased for everybody, but for him especially when his went in." (Reuters)

    Red Bull's renowned designer Newey delays future plans

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Adrian Newey at the Formula 1 Crypto.com Miami Grand Prix 2024 in Miami, USA. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760536_1_20240706214641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Adrian Newey, the much-coveted designer who is leaving Red Bull, will not make any announcement on his future until September at the earliest - and may delay a decision until the end of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newey, 65, has been linked to Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, Williams and Aston Martin, since saying he wanted to leave Red Bull where he has won 13 world titles in nearly two decades of success with the team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has suggested he will continue to work in Formula One and may not make a final decision until later this year after easing off "to focus on final development and delivery of Red Bull's first hyper-car, the RB17", as revealed by Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know. At the moment, I'm just kind of still working on the RB17, our track car, and just taking some time off, Newey told Sky Sports F1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last week, actually, we took seven days and had lucky timing with the weather and went around the south coast with our dogs in an old Aston Martin DB6. Great fun!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if he had to decide his future by a deadline at the end of the year, he said, "That's certainly the target. I'll need to have my mind up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newey, widely regarded as a guru of ground effect technology, is expected to leave Red Bull finally in March next year, allowing him to take part in the development of a new car for the new 2026 regulations with whichever team he joins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was reported to have had a tour of Aston Martin's factory last month and has been in negotiations with them, but any deal with the ambitious Silverstone team is unlikely to be announced before September to comply with his contract at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aston Martin last week recruited the highly-rated former Mercedes engine boss Andy Cowell to take over as group chief executive officer, replacing Martin Whitmarsh in October. (AFP)

    Winning all that matters at Euro 2024 for Mbappe
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Portugal's forward Cristiano Ronaldo embraces France's Kylian Mbappe prior to the UEFA Euro 2024 quarter-final match. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760540_1_20240706221117.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three goals scored in five games, one a penalty and two own goals, and yet Kylian Mbappe's France are into the semi-finals of yet another major tournament as Spain await at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is remarkable that any team could get to the last four of such a competition despite struggling so much in front of goal, but all the more so when that team is captained by arguably the best forward in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe is surrounded by other world-class attackers, but his penalty in a group-stage draw with Poland is the only goal scored by a French player at this European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having edged Belgium in the last 16 thanks to a late own goal, France came through a nail-biting quarter-final against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal on Friday, triumphing 5-3 on penalties after a goalless two hours of football in Hamburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have said it before lots of competitions. The most important thing is that we win," Mbappe told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People thought it was a wisecrack. I have only scored one goal but we are in the semi-finals and I am really happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In charge for 12 years and at his sixth major tournament, France coach Didier Deschamps has regularly been criticised for not playing thrilling football with an extraordinary collection of players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he has always got results, with France winning the 2018 World Cup and 2021 UEFA Nations League under his watch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They lost the 2022 World Cup final on penalties to Argentina and the Euro 2016 final in extra time against Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now they are in a fourth semi-final in the last five major tournaments despite their paltry record in front of goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece may be remembered as perhaps the least spectacular side to win such a competition, but their status as outsiders at Euro 2004 justified a more cautious approach, and they still scored seven goals in six matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including their 0-0 friendly draw against Canada just before the Euros, France have gone six games without one of their players finding the net in open play, a first in 60 years according to statisticians Opta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That record has not prevented them advancing to the semi-final against a Spain side who have found the net 11 times in Germany. (AFP)

    All Blacks edge England 16-15 in bruising encounter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England's George Martin is tackled by New Zealand's Sevu Reece during the rugby union Test match between the New Zealand All Blacks and England at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760528_1_20240706190400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damian McKenzie landed two late penalties as New Zealand beat England 16-15 in the first Test on Saturday to make a winning start to the tenure of new coach Scott Robertson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks held their nerve in a brutal defensive contest in Dunedin in which both teams scored two tries, extending their winning run on home soil against England to eight matches since 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It took a grinding effort in the second half to secure victory after England winger Immanuel Feyi-Waboso scored a try to break a 10-10 deadlock at the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks struggled to penetrate a disciplined England defence and never threatened a try in the second half, but they did enough to set up McKenzie for penalty goals in the 54th and 65th minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie was timed out when lining up a third penalty attempt in the dying stages but England failed to score from the final play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The All Blacks came into the game after just 10 days under former Canterbury Crusaders mentor Robertson, who succeeded Ian Foster after the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had also lost a handful of experienced players -- retired or playing abroad -- in the wake of their World Cup final loss to South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coming off a 52-17 win over Japan two weeks earlier, England played with great cohesion but also struggled to create try-scoring chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither team led by more than five points throughout an absorbing contest dominated by the physicality of the collisions and some confusion on rulings made by Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England fly-half Marcus Smith missed an early penalty before All Blacks winger Sevu Reece opened the scoring with a try after fielding a McKenzie cross-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors struck back through a close range try by lock Maro Itoje but New Zealand regained the ascendancy when 2023 World Player of Year Ardie Savea capitalised on a break from full-back Stephen Perofeta to score in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand conceded a penalty after the half-time hooter which was slotted by Smith to square the scores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England dominated the opening exchanges after the break and created space for Feyi-Waboso to cross in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England prop Joe Marler could be in doubt for the second Test in Auckland next week after exiting early with a foot complaint while All Blacks scrum-half TJ Perenara didn't return from the half-time break following a knee injury. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (centre) looks on at the Spain-Germany match. The hosts were knocked out of the tournament.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain will face France in the semi-finals of Euro 2024 after knocking out hosts Germany as Turkey reacted with dismay to defender Merih Demiral's two-match ban for making an alleged ultra-nationalist salute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Luis de la Fuente's Spain triumphed 2-1 in an engrossing match between the two best-performing teams at the tournament, thanks to Mikel Merino heading home Dani Olmo's cross just as the match looked destined for a penalty shoot-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a winning horse... I'm proud to coach players like this, players that are insatiable," said De la Fuente.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a tough end to the tournament for Germany, who pushed Spain all the way and took the match to extra time with Florian Wirtz's 89th-minute strike which levelled Olmo's opener for La Roja.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We played a good tournament but when you're so close, to be eliminated like that, it's bitter," said Toni Kroos after his final Germany match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain now will be favourites to claim a record-breaking fourth European crown after their seventh straight win inspired by Olmo, who replaced injured Pedri after just eight minutes following a clash between the Barcelona midfielder and Kroos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They came through a huge test against the Germans in Stuttgart and will pose a completely different kind of problem to France, who beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties after a drab match finished goalless after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Theo Hernandez coolly struck home the winning spot-kick as France went through to the last four despite their only goals from open play in the tournament being scored by opposition players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joao Felix was the only player to miss in the shoot-out, striking the base of post, meaning that Portugal go home and ageing icon Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score a goal at a major tournament for the first time in his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France have reached the semis in four of the last five tournaments and coach Didier Deschamps said: "We mustn't take that for granted, that's what I always say. It's what all the players in the team deserve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey's government blasted as "unfair and biased" Demiral's ban, which means he misses Saturday's last-eight clash with the Netherlands and that his Euros campaign is over unless Vincenzo Montella's team reach the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demiral was the unlikely hero with a brace in Turkey's 2-1 win over Austria in the last 16 and during celebrations for his second goal made a gesture associated with Turkish right-wing extremist group Grey Wolves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UEFA banned Demiral for, among other things, "violating the basic rules of decent conduct", a move which Turkey's Sports Minister Osman Askin Bak claimed was politically motivated and Montella said was based on a "misunderstanding".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It wasn't a political gesture as it was interpreted," insisted Montella, who added that the wolf gesture is a "symbol of the Turks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will have a vociferous backing in Berlin for a match which will be attended by the country's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claimed Demiral was just "showing his excitement".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England will have Jude Bellingham available for their quarter-final with Switzerland after he was handed a reprieve by UEFA for his crotch-grabbing celebration after keeping the Three Lions in the competition in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham, who has scored twice in Germany, was filmed mimicking the gesture while apparently looking towards Slovakia's bench following his stunning stoppage-time overhead kick which took that match to extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gareth Southgate called UEFA's ruling, which allows him to select his star player, a "common sense" decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there was no intent in the gesture towards anybody other than the communication he has with his family," claimed Southgate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A win over the Swiss, who dumped out Italy in the last 16, would set up a semi-final with Turkey or the Dutch as England look to break a 58-year major tournament duck. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray suffered a losing start in his farewell to Wimbledon on Thursday, weeping openly in front of his adoring fans before admitting: "I wish I could play forever."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murray, a two-time singles champion at Wimbledon, and brother Jamie were defeated 7-6 (8/6), 6-4 by Rinky Hijikata and John Peers of Australia in the first round of men's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first episode of a retirement three-parter – the 37-year-old Murray is scheduled to play mixed doubles with Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon before he retires at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After having a metal hip inserted in 2019, suffering ankle damage this year and undergoing surgery to remove a cyst from his spine which ruled him out of singles at Wimbledon, Murray has reluctantly accepted the writing is on the wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His career has yielded three Grand Slam titles, two Olympic golds, a Davis Cup and the world number-one ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Look it's hard because I would love to keep playing but I can't. Physically it is too tough now, all of the injuries, they have added up and they haven't been insignificant," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tears flowed when video tributes were paid to Murray by a number of stars, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jessica Pegula became the highest-ranked player to be dumped out of Wimbledon so far on Thursday, losing 6-4, 6-7 (7/9), 6-1 to China's Wang Xinyu in the second round.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American, ranked fifth in the world, battled back after losing the first set, saving a match point in the second-set tie-break, before levelling the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But China's 42nd-ranked Wang raced into a 5-0 lead in the decider before wrapping up the contest to record her first win against a top-10 player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, said: "Couple of days ago I was asking my coach, 'When will this happen?'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Jessica was really tough to play on grass. Her ball was super low and I'm just really happy I won in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang will face Britain's Harriet Dart, who defeated Nottingham champion Katie Boulter, for a spot in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova earlier this week became the first defending women's champion to lose in the first round for 30 years. (AFP)

    Alcaraz, Sinner through to Wimbledon's third round

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Title rivals Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz reached the Wimbledon third round on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Sinner defeated Italian Davis Cup teammate Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a three-hour 42-minute duel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berrettini, the 2021 runner-up, fired 65 winners, including 28 aces, past the top seed and carved out four breaks of serve to two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Sinner calmly recovered from a break down in the fourth set before playing the more composed tiebreak, which ended when Berrettini committed his 48th and final unforced error of the contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very tough we had to face each other in the second round," said 2023 semi-finalist Sinner, who will take on Miomir Kecmanovic for a place in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz defeated Australia's world number 69 Aleksandar Vukic 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 6-2 on the back of 42 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Spaniard's only moments of concern came in the first set when he let slip a 5-2 lead and found himself 5-6 down with Vukic serving for the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the three-time major winner steadied the ship to race away to victory against a player who got the better of him in qualifying at the 2020 French Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz next faces fellow crowd-pleaser Frances Tiafoe, the American he defeated in five sets in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open on his way to his first Grand Slam triumph. (AFP)

    Cavendish breaks Tour de France stage wins record

<div class="itemFullText">
 A long home straight helped them form a lead out train the 'Manx Missile' mastered as he powered across the finish line well ahead of Belgian Jasper Philipsen, last year's sprint points green jersey winner.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In 2023 Cavendish left the Tour in an ambulance after a banal crash bamboozled his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two seasons previously when Cavendish equalled all-time great Eddy Merckx's stage haul in Carcassonne, it was his fourth win on that edition racing for Quick Step after years in the wilderness suffering from Epstein Barr virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's my 15th Tour de France and it takes a lot to get here, getting in shape every year," Cavendish said at the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm surrounded by incredible people and I owe a lot to them" added Cavendish who made his Tour debut in 2008 before becoming world road race champion three years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He missed out on a 35th stage on the Champs Elysees coming second and then missed the cut for the 2022 Tour as Quick Step picked Fabio Jakobsen 10 years his junior.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cavendish joined Astana in 2023 before being persuaded to sign a one-year contract extension for this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Race leader and two-time former winner Tadej Pogacar almost hit a traffic island causing a wave of movement and a pile up of bikes and bodies behind him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Slovenian preferred to focus on Cavendish after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I used to watch him on television and we loved him," Pogacar said. "Just back there I saw him and he said hey, don't you go breaking my record," he jokingly added. (AFP)

    Murray to partner Raducanu in Wimbledon mixed doubles

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray is teaming up with Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon in an eye-catching all-British mixed doubles pairing as part of his farewell to the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair were on Wednesday granted a wild card just a day after Murray, 37, pulled out of the singles due to his failure to regain full fitness following a back operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-time Wimbledon singles champion will also play men's doubles with his brother Jamie at the All England Club, with the pair launching their campaign on Centre Court on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mixed doubles event starts the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray played mixed doubles with Serena Williams in 2019, making it to the third round, but it will be a Grand Slam debut in doubles for Raducanu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old floated the idea of teaming up with Murray two years ago, telling the BBC: "We haven't actually spoken about it but it's something we feel we both want to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked following her first-round singles win on Monday about Murray's influence on her, Raducanu, US Open champion in 2021, said: "I think the biggest advice is just how he's always taken care of his operations, how he manages his people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really spoken to him so much. I think for me it's just watching him operate day to day, watching him be absolutely on it with everything. Even in practice now he's so on it to the minute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray and Raducanu face a tough opening round contest against Marcelo Arevalo and Zhang Shuai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arevalo last month won the men's doubles title for the second time at the French Open while Zhang is also a two-time Grand Slam doubles champion. (AFP)

 Two-time former champion Tadej Pogacar won stage four of the Tour de France on Tuesday to reclaim the overall leader's yellow jersey on the first major mountain challenge in the Alps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovenian superstar Pogacar's triumph was built by his UAE Team on the ascent of the Galibier mountain with three teammates still with their leader when all their rivals had seen their sherpas dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgian Quick Step rider Remco Evenepoel finished second 35 seconds off the pace with two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark finishing fifth at 37 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vingegaard's Visma team appeared visibly weaker than during their dominant 2023 showcase second triumph on the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight leader, Education First's Richard Carapaz, was the big loser of the day as the Ecuadorian gave up over five minutes.

    Djokovic wins first match since knee surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Djokovic celebrates winning his first round match at Wimbledon. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760026_1_20240703081800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic wore a gray sleeve on his surgically repaired right knee while winning his first-round match at Wimbledon on Tuesday without too much of a test.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Playing his first match since tearing the meniscus in his knee at the French Open on June 3, Djokovic never faced a break point along the way to a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory over qualifier Vit Kopriva in under two hours on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Very pleased with the way I felt on the court. Obviously, coming into Wimbledon this year was little bit of different circumstances for me, because of the knee. I didn’t know how everything was going to unfold on the court, really,” Djokovic said. “Practice sessions are quite different from official match play. I’m just extremely glad (with) the way I felt today, the way I played.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He accumulated 15 break chances, converting six, and delivered his usual clean strokes, finishing with twice as many winners, 32, as unforced errors, 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were plenty of quick points, which probably was at least in part a result of Djokovic trying not to spend too much time running more than he needed to. He ended up taking 68 of the 91 exchanges that lasted four or fewer strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I tried to really focus on the game and not really think too much about the knee," Djokovic said. “Everything I could possibly do, I’ve done, along with my team, in the last 3 1/2 weeks in order to give myself a chance to be able to play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic has won seven of his men's-record 24 Grand Slam titles at the All England Club and was the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic hurt his knee during a five-set win at Roland Garros and pulled out of that tournament, then had surgery in Paris on June 5. Less than a month later, he was back in action and taking the first step toward what he hopes would be an eighth championship at Wimbledon, which would tie Roger Federer's mark for the most by a man.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey will face the Netherlands in the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 after winning a thriller with Austria 2-1 as both countries reached the last eight of a European Championship for the first time since 2008.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Merih Demiral was the unlikely hero for Turkey, in soaking Leipzig, after bundling his team ahead with less than a minute on the clock and then thumping in the decisive header just before the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vincenzo Montella's side, who were missing suspended captain Hakan Calhanoglu but once again backed by massive support at the Zentralstadion, will take on the Dutch in Berlin on Saturday after their comfortable 3-0 win over Romania earlier on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey were beaten 6-1 by Austria in March and Montella admitted he was hoping to get his own back for that embarrassing defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will again be able to count on their raucous fans in the German capital as they aim to replicate their run to the last four from 16 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ralf Rangnick's Austria were on top for most of the match and in particular in the second half, when they pinned Turkey back and conceded the second goal completely against the run of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Ahli centre-back Demiral became the first European defender to score twice in the knockout stages of a major tournament since Lilian Thuram for France at the 1998 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Gregoritsch halved the deficit by forcing home Stefan Posch's flick on at another corner shortly after Demiral took his international goal tally to four in 48 caps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Austria couldn't capitalise on their dominance and went out after Christoph Baumgartner was denied a leveller in the final seconds of added time by an incredible Mert Gunok save.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cody Gakpo and Donyell Malen, with a brace in the second half, eased the Dutch through to the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronald Koeman's side were heavily criticised after the 3-2 defeat to Austria which led the Oranje to finish third in Group D.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they were impressive on Tuesday, creating a hatful of chances and running out deserved winners in at the Allianz Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo was the Netherlands' most impressive performer and put his team ahead in the 20th minute when his rasping shot caught goalkeeper Florin Nita off-guard at his near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo's mazy dribble through a crowded penalty area led to him finding Malen who tapped home and then added the third in stoppage time to make the scoreline more representative of the balance of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whoever wins between the Netherlands and Turkey will play either England or Switzerland a week on Wednesday. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro celebrates her shock victory over the reigning champ. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759998_1_20240703001200.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marketa Vondrousova on Tuesday became the first defending women's Wimbledon champion to lose in the first round for 30 years, as Andy Murray ran out of time in his fitness race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Czech sixth seed Vondrousova went down 6-4, 6-2 to Spain's unheralded Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in 66 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova is only the second defending champion to lose in the first round at the All England Club in the Open Era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only other time it has happened was 30 years ago, when Lori McNeil defeated three-time defending champion Steffi Graf in the 1994 opening round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 83 Bouzas Maneiro, playing in only the third Grand Slam main draw of her career, broke her opponent five times in the match under the roof on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Until Tuesday she had never defeated a top-40 player, while her only other grass-court match this year was a first-round loss in a low-key event in Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova, who said she was wary in her first match since she hurt her hip at last month's Berlin grass-court tournament, struggled to impose her serve and made 28 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Practice was fine and everything," said the Czech. "Today I was a bit scared because of my leg too. But I don't think that was the reason. I felt nervous from the start."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added: "It's tough to go out defending the title."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a different story for 2022 champion Elena Rybakina, who cantered past Romania's Elena-Gabriela Ruse 6-3, 6-1, turning the game on its head with a run of nine straight games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's fifth seed Jessica Pegula raced through her match against US compatriot Ashlyn Krueger in 49 minutes, losing just two games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men's side, Murray's camp confirmed he was not fit enough to play singles at his final Wimbledon as Novak Djokovic prepared to launch his bid for a record-equalling eighth men's crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The withdrawal of two-time champion Murray means Djokovic is the only member of the fabled "Big Four" in the men's draw at the All England Club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roger Federer has retired and Rafael Nadal opted to skip Wimbledon to prepare for a shot at another Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray, 37, is hoping to end his stellar career at the upcoming Paris Games but desperately wanted to make a final singles appearance at Wimbledon, where he was champion in 2013 and 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scot, who has been ravaged by injuries in recent years, will still play doubles with his brother Jamie in what is bound to be an emotional farewell in front of his adoring British fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his back last month after being forced to pull out of Queen's, a procedure he described as "not insignificant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he admitted defeat in his race to be fit on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, despite working incredibly hard on his recovery since his operation just over a week ago, Andy has taken the very difficult decision not to play the singles this year," said a statement from Murray's representatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was replaced in the draw by Belgium's David Goffin, a lucky loser from qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, born a week apart from Murray in May 1987, had a knee operation after pulling out before his French Open quarter-final – sparking fears he would not be fit in time for Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Serbian world number two, who was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz in last year's final, has said he is "pain-free" and opens against Czech qualifier Vit Kopriva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He knows time is not on his side as he bids to equal Federer's Wimbledon title record and become the first player – man or woman – to win 25 Grand Slam singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do have something that is described as a feeling of not missing out at a Grand Slam while I can still play and while I'm still active and at this level," said Djokovic, who has reached the past five finals at the All England Club. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Grace Citizen’s young number nine, Li Hau-yi, is a rising star in women’s football in Hong Kong. She dreams of representing the SAR, but ironically, her path to success may first take her away from the city, where she can best develop her game by competing against elite players in a professional league.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to be someone who contributes to Hong Kong’s football scene. My goal is to secure a ‘first eleven’ spot on the Hong Kong team. I also hope to be a role model for others; someone people are proud to have as a friend, or a family member," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To make the next step, the 17-year-old will have to take a break from her studies to move to a side in the Chinese Super League because Hong Kong does not have a professional women’s league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said this way, she can concentrate on the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think being a footballer in Hong Kong, in my experience, is quite difficult," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I go to school in the morning at eight, and then practise until around nine or ten in the evening. Sometimes I arrive home at eleven before having to wake up early again the next day," she said, describing her average day in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   <br/>
   Li’s teammate, Iris Kwok, 30, knows a thing or two about the challenges of playing professionally outside of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok played in the territory’s amateur and semi-professional leagues for two decades before Spanish second-tier side Rayo Vallecano added her to their roster in March. Kwok said the transition was tough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The playing-level is high there, whether that is the technique or physicality, so it took a bit of time to adapt. The players are very professional and they come really prepared. Their technique is incredible and their speed is fast so, after training with them, I feel like I have improved a lot."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But joining the squad partway through the season meant Kwok was unable to register with the Spanish league, and so did not feature for the Vallecano first team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_4_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Kwok’s coach at Citizen, Leung Kwun-chung, said he was not surprised his former captain caught the eye of an overseas side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leung noted that the path Kwok has gone down is one of the things that could benefit local football in the long term, adding that Kwok’s experience abroad had inspired her teammates at Citizen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I'm trying to provide more chances for the players to play at the highest level. And once they come back, supposedly the general standard, the club standard, or the level of Hong Kong will be increased."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_6_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
     <div class="image-title-1">
      <span>
      </span>
     </div>
     <br/>
     Leung has been coaching Grace Citizen for two years, but he is better known for his achievements as a player. The defender and midfielder has eleven caps for the Hong Kong men's international team, and has a Premier League trophy to his name with local side Tai Po.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, as a coach, he quickly learnt that the women's game is very different; with precious few resources, but plenty of potential.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Men's football in Hong Kong, maybe they've already got the model…You cannot change too much,” he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "But the women's world is totally different. Maybe they’ve just started, it’s just the beginning. We don't have the professional league, and maybe one of the advantages of that is we don't have any limitations."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_8_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
      <div class="image-title-1">
       <span>
       </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Leung said he is trying to make the most of the resources he has at his disposal. That means he is boosting social media exposure, and trying to fill gaps in staffing to maximise players’ potential.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And all this, he hopes, will raise the profile of women’s football in the SAR and attract more money and resources to the sport.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Coach Leung's philosophy at Grace Citizen is having a knock-on effect among the younger members of his squad, one that is epitomised by Li.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "I am so keen to go abroad, whenever more people are sent out, it rouses my determination, which makes me work harder, and believe in myself more.”

    Girmay first black African to win Tour de France stage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wanty's Biniam Girmay celebrates on the podium after winning stage 3. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759880_1_20240702082549.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eritrean Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory in stage three of the Tour de France on Monday as Richard Carapaz took the overall race lead in Turin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ecuador's Carapaz took the yellow jersey from overnight leader Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia. The pair are level on time. Remco Evenepoel and Jonas Vingegaard are third and fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intermarche rider Girmay, 24, who gave the Belgian team its first success on the Tour, is the third African to win on the Grande Boucle after South Africans Daryl Impey and Rob Hunter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple tour winner Chris Froome was born in Kenya but competed for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay won ahead of the Colombian Fernando Gaviria and Belgian Arnaud De Lie in a chaotic finale marked by a late fall as the riders hit speeds of around 65kph in the dash to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash, in which the big favourite for the sprint Jasper Philipsen was involved, created a break in the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time race winner Pogacar, gunning for a historic Giro-Tour double, did not fall but was delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two sweltering stages, the skies were shrouded grey entering the northern Italian industrial city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay is more than just a sprinter, and was aided in his victory by the absence of stage favourite Philipsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He signalled his coming of age in 2022 when he became the first African to win a one-day classic at Gent-Wevelgem, aged 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was his second Grand Tour stage win after the Giro d'Italia in 2022 where he injured an eye opening a bottle of prosecco on the podium. (AFP)
