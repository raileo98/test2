<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray suffered a losing start in his farewell to Wimbledon on Thursday, weeping openly in front of his adoring fans before admitting: "I wish I could play forever."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murray, a two-time singles champion at Wimbledon, and brother Jamie were defeated 7-6 (8/6), 6-4 by Rinky Hijikata and John Peers of Australia in the first round of men's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first episode of a retirement three-parter – the 37-year-old Murray is scheduled to play mixed doubles with Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon before he retires at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After having a metal hip inserted in 2019, suffering ankle damage this year and undergoing surgery to remove a cyst from his spine which ruled him out of singles at Wimbledon, Murray has reluctantly accepted the writing is on the wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His career has yielded three Grand Slam titles, two Olympic golds, a Davis Cup and the world number-one ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Look it's hard because I would love to keep playing but I can't. Physically it is too tough now, all of the injuries, they have added up and they haven't been insignificant," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tears flowed when video tributes were paid to Murray by a number of stars, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jessica Pegula became the highest-ranked player to be dumped out of Wimbledon so far on Thursday, losing 6-4, 6-7 (7/9), 6-1 to China's Wang Xinyu in the second round.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American, ranked fifth in the world, battled back after losing the first set, saving a match point in the second-set tie-break, before levelling the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But China's 42nd-ranked Wang raced into a 5-0 lead in the decider before wrapping up the contest to record her first win against a top-10 player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, said: "Couple of days ago I was asking my coach, 'When will this happen?'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Jessica was really tough to play on grass. Her ball was super low and I'm just really happy I won in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang will face Britain's Harriet Dart, who defeated Nottingham champion Katie Boulter, for a spot in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova earlier this week became the first defending women's champion to lose in the first round for 30 years. (AFP)

    Alcaraz, Sinner through to Wimbledon's third round

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Title rivals Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz reached the Wimbledon third round on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Sinner defeated Italian Davis Cup teammate Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a three-hour 42-minute duel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berrettini, the 2021 runner-up, fired 65 winners, including 28 aces, past the top seed and carved out four breaks of serve to two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Sinner calmly recovered from a break down in the fourth set before playing the more composed tiebreak, which ended when Berrettini committed his 48th and final unforced error of the contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very tough we had to face each other in the second round," said 2023 semi-finalist Sinner, who will take on Miomir Kecmanovic for a place in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz defeated Australia's world number 69 Aleksandar Vukic 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 6-2 on the back of 42 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Spaniard's only moments of concern came in the first set when he let slip a 5-2 lead and found himself 5-6 down with Vukic serving for the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the three-time major winner steadied the ship to race away to victory against a player who got the better of him in qualifying at the 2020 French Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz next faces fellow crowd-pleaser Frances Tiafoe, the American he defeated in five sets in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open on his way to his first Grand Slam triumph. (AFP)

    Cavendish breaks Tour de France stage wins record

<div class="itemFullText">
 A long home straight helped them form a lead out train the 'Manx Missile' mastered as he powered across the finish line well ahead of Belgian Jasper Philipsen, last year's sprint points green jersey winner.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In 2023 Cavendish left the Tour in an ambulance after a banal crash bamboozled his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two seasons previously when Cavendish equalled all-time great Eddy Merckx's stage haul in Carcassonne, it was his fourth win on that edition racing for Quick Step after years in the wilderness suffering from Epstein Barr virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's my 15th Tour de France and it takes a lot to get here, getting in shape every year," Cavendish said at the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm surrounded by incredible people and I owe a lot to them" added Cavendish who made his Tour debut in 2008 before becoming world road race champion three years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He missed out on a 35th stage on the Champs Elysees coming second and then missed the cut for the 2022 Tour as Quick Step picked Fabio Jakobsen 10 years his junior.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cavendish joined Astana in 2023 before being persuaded to sign a one-year contract extension for this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Race leader and two-time former winner Tadej Pogacar almost hit a traffic island causing a wave of movement and a pile up of bikes and bodies behind him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Slovenian preferred to focus on Cavendish after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I used to watch him on television and we loved him," Pogacar said. "Just back there I saw him and he said hey, don't you go breaking my record," he jokingly added. (AFP)

    Murray to partner Raducanu in Wimbledon mixed doubles

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray is teaming up with Emma Raducanu at Wimbledon in an eye-catching all-British mixed doubles pairing as part of his farewell to the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair were on Wednesday granted a wild card just a day after Murray, 37, pulled out of the singles due to his failure to regain full fitness following a back operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-time Wimbledon singles champion will also play men's doubles with his brother Jamie at the All England Club, with the pair launching their campaign on Centre Court on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mixed doubles event starts the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray played mixed doubles with Serena Williams in 2019, making it to the third round, but it will be a Grand Slam debut in doubles for Raducanu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old floated the idea of teaming up with Murray two years ago, telling the BBC: "We haven't actually spoken about it but it's something we feel we both want to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked following her first-round singles win on Monday about Murray's influence on her, Raducanu, US Open champion in 2021, said: "I think the biggest advice is just how he's always taken care of his operations, how he manages his people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really spoken to him so much. I think for me it's just watching him operate day to day, watching him be absolutely on it with everything. Even in practice now he's so on it to the minute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray and Raducanu face a tough opening round contest against Marcelo Arevalo and Zhang Shuai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arevalo last month won the men's doubles title for the second time at the French Open while Zhang is also a two-time Grand Slam doubles champion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time former champion Tadej Pogacar won stage four of the Tour de France on Tuesday to reclaim the overall leader's yellow jersey on the first major mountain challenge in the Alps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovenian superstar Pogacar's triumph was built by his UAE Team on the ascent of the Galibier mountain with three teammates still with their leader when all their rivals had seen their sherpas dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgian Quick Step rider Remco Evenepoel finished second 35 seconds off the pace with two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark finishing fifth at 37 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vingegaard's Visma team appeared visibly weaker than during their dominant 2023 showcase second triumph on the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight leader, Education First's Richard Carapaz, was the big loser of the day as the Ecuadorian gave up over five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar, winner in 2020 and 2021, is attempting to become the first rider since 1998 to win both the Giro d'Italia and Tour in the same year. (AFP)

    Djokovic wins first match since knee surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Djokovic celebrates winning his first round match at Wimbledon. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760026_1_20240703081800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic wore a gray sleeve on his surgically repaired right knee while winning his first-round match at Wimbledon on Tuesday without too much of a test.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Playing his first match since tearing the meniscus in his knee at the French Open on June 3, Djokovic never faced a break point along the way to a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 victory over qualifier Vit Kopriva in under two hours on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Very pleased with the way I felt on the court. Obviously, coming into Wimbledon this year was little bit of different circumstances for me, because of the knee. I didn’t know how everything was going to unfold on the court, really,” Djokovic said. “Practice sessions are quite different from official match play. I’m just extremely glad (with) the way I felt today, the way I played.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He accumulated 15 break chances, converting six, and delivered his usual clean strokes, finishing with twice as many winners, 32, as unforced errors, 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were plenty of quick points, which probably was at least in part a result of Djokovic trying not to spend too much time running more than he needed to. He ended up taking 68 of the 91 exchanges that lasted four or fewer strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I tried to really focus on the game and not really think too much about the knee," Djokovic said. “Everything I could possibly do, I’ve done, along with my team, in the last 3 1/2 weeks in order to give myself a chance to be able to play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic has won seven of his men's-record 24 Grand Slam titles at the All England Club and was the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic hurt his knee during a five-set win at Roland Garros and pulled out of that tournament, then had surgery in Paris on June 5. Less than a month later, he was back in action and taking the first step toward what he hopes would be an eighth championship at Wimbledon, which would tie Roger Federer's mark for the most by a man.

 Turkey will face the Netherlands in the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 after winning a thriller with Austria 2-1 as both countries reached the last eight of a European Championship for the first time since 2008.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Merih Demiral was the unlikely hero for Turkey, in soaking Leipzig, after bundling his team ahead with less than a minute on the clock and then thumping in the decisive header just before the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vincenzo Montella's side, who were missing suspended captain Hakan Calhanoglu but once again backed by massive support at the Zentralstadion, will take on the Dutch in Berlin on Saturday after their comfortable 3-0 win over Romania earlier on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey were beaten 6-1 by Austria in March and Montella admitted he was hoping to get his own back for that embarrassing defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will again be able to count on their raucous fans in the German capital as they aim to replicate their run to the last four from 16 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ralf Rangnick's Austria were on top for most of the match and in particular in the second half, when they pinned Turkey back and conceded the second goal completely against the run of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Ahli centre-back Demiral became the first European defender to score twice in the knockout stages of a major tournament since Lilian Thuram for France at the 1998 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Gregoritsch halved the deficit by forcing home Stefan Posch's flick on at another corner shortly after Demiral took his international goal tally to four in 48 caps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Austria couldn't capitalise on their dominance and went out after Christoph Baumgartner was denied a leveller in the final seconds of added time by an incredible Mert Gunok save.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cody Gakpo and Donyell Malen, with a brace in the second half, eased the Dutch through to the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronald Koeman's side were heavily criticised after the 3-2 defeat to Austria which led the Oranje to finish third in Group D.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they were impressive on Tuesday, creating a hatful of chances and running out deserved winners in at the Allianz Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo was the Netherlands' most impressive performer and put his team ahead in the 20th minute when his rasping shot caught goalkeeper Florin Nita off-guard at his near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo's mazy dribble through a crowded penalty area led to him finding Malen who tapped home and then added the third in stoppage time to make the scoreline more representative of the balance of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whoever wins between the Netherlands and Turkey will play either England or Switzerland a week on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Vondrousova crashes out, Murray bows out of singles

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro celebrates her shock victory over the reigning champ. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759998_1_20240703001200.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marketa Vondrousova on Tuesday became the first defending women's Wimbledon champion to lose in the first round for 30 years, as Andy Murray ran out of time in his fitness race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Czech sixth seed Vondrousova went down 6-4, 6-2 to Spain's unheralded Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in 66 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova is only the second defending champion to lose in the first round at the All England Club in the Open Era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only other time it has happened was 30 years ago, when Lori McNeil defeated three-time defending champion Steffi Graf in the 1994 opening round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 83 Bouzas Maneiro, playing in only the third Grand Slam main draw of her career, broke her opponent five times in the match under the roof on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Until Tuesday she had never defeated a top-40 player, while her only other grass-court match this year was a first-round loss in a low-key event in Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova, who said she was wary in her first match since she hurt her hip at last month's Berlin grass-court tournament, struggled to impose her serve and made 28 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Practice was fine and everything," said the Czech. "Today I was a bit scared because of my leg too. But I don't think that was the reason. I felt nervous from the start."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added: "It's tough to go out defending the title."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a different story for 2022 champion Elena Rybakina, who cantered past Romania's Elena-Gabriela Ruse 6-3, 6-1, turning the game on its head with a run of nine straight games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women's fifth seed Jessica Pegula raced through her match against US compatriot Ashlyn Krueger in 49 minutes, losing just two games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men's side, Murray's camp confirmed he was not fit enough to play singles at his final Wimbledon as Novak Djokovic prepared to launch his bid for a record-equalling eighth men's crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The withdrawal of two-time champion Murray means Djokovic is the only member of the fabled "Big Four" in the men's draw at the All England Club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roger Federer has retired and Rafael Nadal opted to skip Wimbledon to prepare for a shot at another Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray, 37, is hoping to end his stellar career at the upcoming Paris Games but desperately wanted to make a final singles appearance at Wimbledon, where he was champion in 2013 and 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scot, who has been ravaged by injuries in recent years, will still play doubles with his brother Jamie in what is bound to be an emotional farewell in front of his adoring British fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his back last month after being forced to pull out of Queen's, a procedure he described as "not insignificant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he admitted defeat in his race to be fit on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, despite working incredibly hard on his recovery since his operation just over a week ago, Andy has taken the very difficult decision not to play the singles this year," said a statement from Murray's representatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was replaced in the draw by Belgium's David Goffin, a lucky loser from qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, born a week apart from Murray in May 1987, had a knee operation after pulling out before his French Open quarter-final – sparking fears he would not be fit in time for Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Serbian world number two, who was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz in last year's final, has said he is "pain-free" and opens against Czech qualifier Vit Kopriva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He knows time is not on his side as he bids to equal Federer's Wimbledon title record and become the first player – man or woman – to win 25 Grand Slam singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do have something that is described as a feeling of not missing out at a Grand Slam while I can still play and while I'm still active and at this level," said Djokovic, who has reached the past five finals at the All England Club. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Grace Citizen’s young number nine, Li Hau-yi, is a rising star in women’s football in Hong Kong. She dreams of representing the SAR, but ironically, her path to success may first take her away from the city, where she can best develop her game by competing against elite players in a professional league.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to be someone who contributes to Hong Kong’s football scene. My goal is to secure a ‘first eleven’ spot on the Hong Kong team. I also hope to be a role model for others; someone people are proud to have as a friend, or a family member," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To make the next step, the 17-year-old will have to take a break from her studies to move to a side in the Chinese Super League because Hong Kong does not have a professional women’s league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said this way, she can concentrate on the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think being a footballer in Hong Kong, in my experience, is quite difficult," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I go to school in the morning at eight, and then practise until around nine or ten in the evening. Sometimes I arrive home at eleven before having to wake up early again the next day," she said, describing her average day in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>

   </div>
   <br/>
   Li’s teammate, Iris Kwok, 30, knows a thing or two about the challenges of playing professionally outside of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok played in the territory’s amateur and semi-professional leagues for two decades before Spanish second-tier side Rayo Vallecano added her to their roster in March. Kwok said the transition was tough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The playing-level is high there, whether that is the technique or physicality, so it took a bit of time to adapt. The players are very professional and they come really prepared. Their technique is incredible and their speed is fast so, after training with them, I feel like I have improved a lot."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But joining the squad partway through the season meant Kwok was unable to register with the Spanish league, and so did not feature for the Vallecano first team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_4_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    Kwok’s coach at Citizen, Leung Kwun-chung, said he was not surprised his former captain caught the eye of an overseas side.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Leung noted that the path Kwok has gone down is one of the things that could benefit local football in the long term, adding that Kwok’s experience abroad had inspired her teammates at Citizen.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "I'm trying to provide more chances for the players to play at the highest level. And once they come back, supposedly the general standard, the club standard, or the level of Hong Kong will be increased."
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_6_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
     <div class="image-title-1">
      <span>
      </span>
     </div>
     <br/>
     Leung has been coaching Grace Citizen for two years, but he is better known for his achievements as a player. The defender and midfielder has eleven caps for the Hong Kong men's international team, and has a Premier League trophy to his name with local side Tai Po.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, as a coach, he quickly learnt that the women's game is very different; with precious few resources, but plenty of potential.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Men's football in Hong Kong, maybe they've already got the model…You cannot change too much,” he said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "But the women's world is totally different. Maybe they’ve just started, it’s just the beginning. We don't have the professional league, and maybe one of the advantages of that is we don't have any limitations."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <img src="https://nps.rthk.hk/rthk/media/k2/items/src/mfile_1759882_8_20240702091242_preview.jpg">
      <div class="image-title-1">
       <span>
       </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Leung said he is trying to make the most of the resources he has at his disposal. That means he is boosting social media exposure, and trying to fill gaps in staffing to maximise players’ potential.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And all this, he hopes, will raise the profile of women’s football in the SAR and attract more money and resources to the sport.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Coach Leung's philosophy at Grace Citizen is having a knock-on effect among the younger members of his squad, one that is epitomised by Li.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "I am so keen to go abroad, whenever more people are sent out, it rouses my determination, which makes me work harder, and believe in myself more.”

    Girmay first black African to win Tour de France stage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wanty's Biniam Girmay celebrates on the podium after winning stage 3. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759880_1_20240702082549.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eritrean Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory in stage three of the Tour de France on Monday as Richard Carapaz took the overall race lead in Turin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ecuador's Carapaz took the yellow jersey from overnight leader Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia. The pair are level on time. Remco Evenepoel and Jonas Vingegaard are third and fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intermarche rider Girmay, 24, who gave the Belgian team its first success on the Tour, is the third African to win on the Grande Boucle after South Africans Daryl Impey and Rob Hunter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple tour winner Chris Froome was born in Kenya but competed for Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay won ahead of the Colombian Fernando Gaviria and Belgian Arnaud De Lie in a chaotic finale marked by a late fall as the riders hit speeds of around 65kph in the dash to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash, in which the big favourite for the sprint Jasper Philipsen was involved, created a break in the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time race winner Pogacar, gunning for a historic Giro-Tour double, did not fall but was delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two sweltering stages, the skies were shrouded grey entering the northern Italian industrial city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay is more than just a sprinter, and was aided in his victory by the absence of stage favourite Philipsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He signalled his coming of age in 2022 when he became the first African to win a one-day classic at Gent-Wevelgem, aged 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was his second Grand Tour stage win after the Giro d'Italia in 2022 where he injured an eye opening a bottle of prosecco on the podium. (AFP)

    France, Portugal scramble into Euros last eight

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France have battled their way to the Euro 2024 quarter-finals despite a misfiring attack that once again failed to click in Monday's tense 1-0 win against Belgium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It took an own goal, the tournament's ninth, with just five minutes remaining in Duesseldorf to give France a nerve-jangling victory that raised fresh questions about the form of their key forwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While France celebrated Jan Vertonghen's own goal with gusto, boss Didier Deschamps acknowledged it could have been a far more comfortable passage to the last eight if they taken a host of earlier chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No France player has scored in open play in four matches in Germany as the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann struggle to reproduce the thrilling performances which carried Les Bleus to the 2022 World Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deschamps's side have been worryingly inaccurate in front of goal and they needed two fine saves from Mike Maignan to keep them on level terms before Vertonghen diverted Randal Kolo Muani's shot into his own net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France had the better of possession, played and completed more passes and had 20 shots to Belgium's five but only worked Red Devils goalkeeper Koen Casteels once before Vertonghen's own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa saved three Slovenia penalties to earn his side a 3-0 shoot-out victory after Cristiano Ronaldo redeemed himself from the spot in a dramatic Euro 2024 last 16 clash on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal forward Ronaldo broke down in tears after missing a penalty in the first period of extra-time in the goalless tie in Frankfurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he recovered to convert in the shoot-out as Portugal scraped through to set up a blockbuster clash with France in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia battled valiantly to keep Portugal at bay, with Jan Oblak making a stunning save to keep out Ronaldo's penalty after Diogo Jota was fouled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva all scored in the shoot-out and Slovenia's trio missed, sending the Selecao through in heart-stopping fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal coach Roberto Martinez reverted to a more familiar 4-3-3 system after his side were embarrassed by debutants Georgia in their last group game when he deployed three at the back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Euro 2016 winners dominated the ball and created their first chance after 12 minutes when Silva's inviting cross just evaded Ronaldo and Fernandes could not turn home at the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia, playing in their first ever knock-out match at a major competition, maintained their defensive shape well and limited Portugal's opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Real Madrid striker Ronaldo directed a soft header at his old nemesis, Atletico Madrid keeper Oblak, under vital pressure from Vanja Drkusic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Slovenian defender was booked moments later for bringing down the surging Rafael Leao as he charged towards Oblak's goal. Ronaldo smashed the free-kick narrowly over the bar with the goalkeeper at full stretch. (AFP)

 Double Rugby World Cup winner Portia Woodman-Wickliffe said on Monday that she will retire from the sport after this summer's Paris Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Winger Woodman-Wickliffe, 32, and the Black Ferns are defending Olympic women's gold medal during the tournament in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the World Cup in the shorter form of the sport in 2013 and 2018 having lifted the 15s title in 2017 and 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After 12 incredible years representing New Zealand in 7s and 15s, the upcoming Paris Olympics will be my last time playing in the black jersey," Woodman-Wickliffe said on Instagram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rugby has provided me more than a career, it's given me a second whanau [family] in my sisters, opportunities to see the world and experience things I never would have otherwise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One last dance with my sisters in Paris," 2015's World Rugby sevens player of the year added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's sevens at the Paris Games begin on July 28 at the Stade de France with the gold medal match two days later. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England star Jude Bellingham is being investigated by Uefa over a potentially offensive gesture made during a European Championship win against Slovakia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uefa said on Monday it appointed a disciplinary inspector to look at “a potential violation of the basic rules of decent conduct.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham seemed to make a gesture with his hand toward his crotch after scoring an acrobatic stoppage-time equaliser before England went on to win 2-1 in extra time on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham's overhead kick with about 80 seconds left in the game saved England from a humiliating exit in the first knockout round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Uefa charges Bellingham in a disciplinary case he risks being suspended for the quarter-final against Switzerland on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Information on this matter will be made available in due course,” the European soccer body said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham took to social media late on Sunday to deny suggestions he gestured toward the Slovakia bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An inside joke gesture towards some close friends who were at the game. Nothing but respect for how that Slovakia team played tonight,” Bellingham wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 17-year-old Chinese player has died after collapsing on court during an international tournament in Indonesia, badminton officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang Zhijie was taken ill during a match late on Sunday against Japan's Kazuma Kawano at the Asian Junior Badminton Mixed Team Championships in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The score was 11-11 in the first game when Zhang suddenly fell to the floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A doctor and medical team were quickly on the scene and he was taken to hospital by ambulance within minutes, but passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China's Zhang Zhijie, a singles player, collapsed on the court during a match in the evening," Badminton Asia and the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) said in a joint statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was sent to the hospital where he passed away at 23:20 local time yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was attended to by the tournament doctor and medical team. He was taken in the standby ambulance in less than two minutes and sent to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Badminton Asia, PBSI and the organising committee are immensely saddened and expressed their deepest condolences to Zhang's parents, family, and the Chinese Badminton Association."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The world of badminton has lost a talented player," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry expressed condolences to Zhang's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ministry will continue to guide the Chinese consulate in Surabaya to conduct follow-up work," spokesperson Mao Ning said in a daily press conference. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spain's Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams celebrate with a victory dance. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759727_1_20240701053719.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodri, Fabian Ruiz, Nico Williams and Dani Olmo all scored as Spain came from behind to beat surprise package Georgia 4-1 at Euro 2024 on Sunday and set up a blockbuster quarter-final against hosts Germany.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Robin Le Normand's own goal gave Georgia a shock lead in the 18th minute of this last-16 tie to send their noisy supporters wild in Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first goal Spain had conceded at the competition but they came back to equalise six minutes before the interval courtesy of Manchester City midfielder Rodri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz then headed home in the 51st minute and Williams ran through for the third before substitute Olmo made sure of the win as La Roja stay on track to become European champions for the fourth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain now take on Germany in the last eight in Stuttgart on Friday in a repeat of the Euro 2008 final, which they won 1-0 to begin their golden era of dominance in international football.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luis de la Fuente's current team are looking to bring back the glory days and they were expected to brush Georgia aside here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They would have ultimately won by a far greater margin had they converted more of their chances, with 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal squandering several opportunities in his attempt to become the youngest ever goal-scorer at the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia are ranked 74th in the world, 66 places below Spain. Willy Sagnol's team lost twice to Spain in qualifying, going down 7-1 at home and 3-1 away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet they still qualified for a first major tournament and then made it to the knockout stages with a stunning 2-0 win over Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagnol said on the eve of this match that his unfancied team had "already won the European Championship" thanks to their remarkable run, and they now go home with their heads held high despite eventually crumbling here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have a lively attacking partnership between Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Georges Mikautadze that is a danger for any opponent, and Giorgi Mamardashvili has been one of the best goalkeepers at the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mamardashvili had already saved from Pedri and kept out Dani Carvajal's glancing header before Georgia went ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move started with a fine piece of play by Kvaratskhelia, who had little room to manoeuvre on the left wing but picked out a pass for Mikautadze, who then released Otar Kakabadze on the right wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kakabadze's cross into the box was a horrible one for Le Normand, who had Kvaratskhelia arriving behind him and could not stop the ball rebounding off him and into the net for the eighth own goal of Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain were now vulnerable to the counterattack, which is Georgia's strength, but the men in red continued to dominate the game and kept testing Mamardashvili.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Valencia shot-stopper made several more interventions in an increasingly wild encounter before the equaliser finally came, Rodri controlling a Williams pass at the edge of the box and stroking the ball into the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It felt as if that might be that for Georgia, but they remained audacious on the break, with Kvaratskhelia almost scoring from inside his own half at the beginning of the second period, his shot going just wide with goalkeeper Unai Simon out of position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain went ahead shortly after, as Yamal crossed from the right for Ruiz to head in his second goal of the tournament at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal didn't just miss chances of his own, as he also forced an own goal which was disallowed for offside before Georgia fell apart defensively under increasingly heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz released Williams, who ran from inside his own half, skipped past Giorgi Gvelesiani into the box and fired into the roof of the net to make it 3-1 on 75 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A delightful control and finish from the edge of the box by Olmo completed the scoring with seven minutes left. (AFP)

    Bellingham, Kane rescue England from shock Euro exit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jude Bellingham's spectacular bicycle kick saves England's blushes. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759726_1_20240701034625.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England escaped an embarrassing last 16 exit at Euro 2024 thanks to Jude Bellingham's overhead kick before Harry Kane struck in extra-time for a 2-1 win over Slovakia on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Three Lions have been hyped as one of the favourites to end a 58-year wait for major tournament glory but looked set to go out with a whimper to Ivan Schranz's 25th minute goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Bellingham's moment of inspiration five minutes into six added on in stoppage time breathed new life into Gareth Southgate's reign as England boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane then headed in just a minute into extra-time to set up a quarter-final meeting with Switzerland on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate looked certain to fall on his sword after steadfastly refusing to make changes to a side that stumbled through as winners of Group C despite scoring just two goals in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kobbie Mainoo was introduced for his first competitive start in Southgate's only change and he paid the price with another lacklustre display lacking in any speed or invention for long spells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one saving grace of England's performances in the group stage was that a makeshift defence had held up well, conceding just once in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they were torn to pieces early on by a Slovakia side ranked 45th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England did not heed a couple of warnings as David Hancko and Lukas Haraslin were wasteful with big chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia finally punished their more illustrious opponents when David Strelec was given acres of room to turn and play in Schranz, who confidently stroked past Jordan Pickford for his third goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his lack of experience, Mainoo was one of the few players that threatened to spark England into life as the Manchester United midfielder's effort was deflected wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The half-time whistle was met with a chorus of boos but Southgate still stuck to his guns and did not make a change until 25 minutes to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England did at least improve on a dismal first half and had the ball in the net within five minutes of the restart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Foden turned in Kieran Trippier's cross but was caught offside after a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia should have doubled their lead shortly afterwards when England gave away possession and Strelec saw Pickford well off his line but failed to hit the target from the halfway line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate's hand was finally forced on 66 minutes by an injury to Trippier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the major calls the England boss will come to regret is only naming one natural left-back in his 26-man squad in Luke Shaw, who has not played a minute for club or country since February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Shaw not match-fit, Bukayo Saka was forced to deputise at left-back to make room for the introduction of Cole Palmer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England's chances seemed to have gone when Kane headed wide a golden opportunity and Declan Rice smashed the post with a long-range pot shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate was even derided by the England support for bringing on Ivan Toney deep into stoppage time with chants of "you don't know what you're doing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, there was an incredible twist as Bellingham acrobatically turned home Guehi's flick-on from a throw-in the final moments of added-on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia were suddenly rattled and Toney was to have a telling contribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brentford striker headed Eberechi Eze's mishit shot back across goal for Kane to power home his second goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia should still have taken the game to penalties when full-back Peter Pekarik failed to turn in a dangerous driven cross from point-blank range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But England live to fight another day come the quarter-final against an impressive Switzerland, who comfortably knocked out holders Italy 2-0 on Saturday. (AFP)

 Mercedes' George Russell was gifted a win in the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday after a dramatic late collision between Max Verstappen and Lando Norris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pole sitter Verstappen had to settle for fifth after leading for much of the race while Norris was forced to retire his McLaren after a nip and tuck battle between the pair for the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oscar Piastri in the other McLaren took second with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz completing the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell said: "Incredible, it was a tough fight, starting in third. I was watching on the big screen and knew Lando would try and get that race win, but the team has done a great job to get us in the fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So proud to be back on the top step," added the British driver, who notched up Mercedes' last win in Brazil in 2022. (AFP)

  Electing to bat on a dry surface, 2007 champions India overcame a top-order meltdown to post a competitive 176-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Virat Kohli (76) struck his first 50 of this World Cup and Axar Patel smashed 47 to power India to a healthy total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anrich Nortje and Keshav Maharaj claimed two wickets apiece for South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Proteas suffered a top order collapse of their own but Quinton de Kock (39) and Tristan Stubbs (31) put their chase back on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heinrich Klaasen (52) then counter-attacked in spectacular fashion but India's impeccable death-overs bowling restricted South Africa to 169-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, Kohli confirmed that he was quitting T20 Internationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was my last T20 game playing for India," player-of-the-match Kohli said following India's victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Time for the next generation to take the T20 game forward."  (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of superb strikes from Remo Freuler and Ruben Vargas for Switzerland sent defending champions Italy crashing out of the European soccer championship in the round of 16 after a sloppy, rudderless display by Luciano Spalletti's side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Though the Swiss defended well, the Italians made their job all the easier with bad passing and poor-decision-making, giving the ball away cheaply in central positions and failing to press with any vigour as they headed for the exit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a slow, tenuous start on a sweltering evening in Berlin, Switzerland should have taken the lead in the 24th minute when Breel Embolo was played in, but his attempt to wait out Gianluigi Donnarumma didn't succeed and the Italian goalkeeper comfortably parried his curled shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking far more like defending champions than the men in blue, the Swiss breakthrough came 13 minutes later with brilliantly-worked goal as they pulled the Italians out of position, Freuler hammering the ball home from a pin-point pass by Vargas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whatever Spalletti said at half-time did not have the desired effect and his side were two down within a minute, with Italy's ponderous, flat-footed defence taking on a spectator's role as Vargas curled a stunning shot into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss almost threw the Italians a lifeline in the 51st minute as Fabian Schaer's glancing header wrong-footed keeper Yann Sommer, leaving him to watch helplessly as the ball bounced up and kissed the far post before being cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the clock ticking ominously, the Italian players seemed paralysed in the face of the Swiss defence, resorting to speculative long shots that did little to trouble Sommer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woodwork intervened again in the 74th minute as Gianluca Scammacca scuffed the ball onto the near post from close range but that was as close as they came, and Italian fans were streaming out of the stands long before the final whistle, with those left in their seats dumbstruck by their team's insipid performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That goal at the start of the second half cut our legs, we weren't very incisive," said Italian coach Spalletti after the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What made the difference is the pace, we had a pace that was too inferior to them in the first half. Even in the individual players there was a different pace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other game, a Kai Havertz penalty and a Jamal Musiala strike gave Germany a 2-0 win over Denmark as the host nation reached the quarter-finals after a dramatic game that was delayed by almost half an hour in the first half due to a violent storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Havertz stroked home from the spot early in the second half in Dortmund following a handball by Joachim Andersen, the unlucky Danish defender who had a goal disallowed at the other end only moments earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musiala, of Bayern Munich, then ran away to stroke in the second goal midway through the second half as Germany's class told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one point it looked as if the game could be abandoned as English referee Michael Oliver stopped play in the 35th minute of the first half and took the teams off the pitch while a violent storm passed overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain, hailstones, high winds, thunder and lightning caused a break in play of 25 minutes before the action could resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It made for a memorable night, and one that ended with the host nation coming through a stern test of their credentials to keep alive their dream of winning the trophy in Berlin on July 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The path is set to get much tougher from here, however, and Julian Nagelsmann's team will now go to Stuttgart for a quarter-final next Friday against either much-fancied Spain or surprise package Georgia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Denmark, who famously beat Germany in the 1992 European Championship final, go home without winning a game. (Reuters, AFP)

    Unstoppable Verstappen clinches pole in Austria

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen continued his imperious form in Red Bull's homeland on Saturday when, after winning the sprint race, he claimed a convincing pole position for Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The series leader and three-time world champion clocked a best lap in 1 minute 4.314 seconds to outpace nearest rival Lando Norris of McLaren by 0.404sec for his fourth Austrian pole at the Red Bull Ring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also ended a run of three races where he was beaten in qualifying in Monaco, Canada and Spain and brought him his 40th career pole position.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That went really well," said Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to adjust things a bit after this morning and it went well. It was warmer than yesterday and a bit tricky but the car felt good and I could attack the corners much more. It felt on point and really good out there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a while since we've been on pole and we have worked hard to be more competitive.'
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris said: "I think that was the best we could do today and Max was in a league of his own - but I am happy and I'll take that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George Russell took third for Mercedes ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes, Charles Leclerc in his Ferrari and Oscar Piastri in the second McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piastri's best flying lap was deleted for exceeding track limits in the closing minutes when he briefly went third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sergio Perez was eighth in the second Red Bull, continuing his struggles, ahead of Haas's Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Ocon of Alpine. (AFP)

    Brazil up their game to beat Paraguay 4-1

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brazil forward Vinicius Junior anticipates the ball during the second half. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759569_1_20240629130036.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazil's Vinicius Jr scored twice in his side's 4-1 Copa America victory over Paraguay in a Group D clash in Nevada on Friday, bouncing back from a lacklustre display in his first game of the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Colombia, who have qualified for the quarter-finals, top Group D with six points after two matches, with Brazil in second on four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costa Rica are third with one point and Paraguay, who are bottom with zero after two defeats, have been eliminated from the competition in the group stage for only the second time since 2001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This victory marked Brazil's first win in six competitive matches and their maiden competitive win under the management of Dorival Jr, who took charge of the team in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the whistle, Vinicius' pace and trickery posed a constant threat to Paraguay down the left flank, a far cry from his performance in Brazil's 0-0 draw with Costa Rica in their opening group stage match, in which he was largely ineffectual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Brazil's strong start, it was Paraguay who almost went ahead in the 15th minute as Damian Bobadilla's goal-bound effort took a massive deflection off Eder Militao and nearly wrongfooted Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker, who showed quick reflexes to keep out the strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil earned a 28th-minute penalty for a handball, which was fired wide by Lucas Paqueta, but the midfielder made up for his miss seven minutes later as he set up Vinicius with a first-time pass to cap off a flowing team move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girona winger Savio doubled Brazil's advantage after pouncing on a rebound inside the box, before Vinicius stuck out a boot to divert a clearance from Omar Alderete into the net for his second goal of the night in first half stoppage time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paraguay got a goal back after the break as Alderete netted a superb long-range, but any hopes of a comeback were swiftly dashed when Brazil were awarded a penalty in the 68th minute after a handball by Mathias Villasanti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his earlier miss, Paqueta stepped up and made no mistake at the second time of asking to send Brazil's fans at the Allegiant Stadium into delirium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Towards the end of the match, tempers flared and Andres Cubas was shown a red card after kicking out at Douglas Luiz, with Brazil using their man's advantage to comfortably see out the game and clinch the three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In particular the first half, up to the 40 minutes, it was very even," Paraguay coach Daniel Garnero told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we created some opportunities. Unfortunately, in the three minutes we got a bit distracted and they scored two goals that made a great difference in the result. And Vinicius is an elite player, no doubt about it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil next face group leaders Colombia in California on Tuesday, where a draw would be enough to secure qualification for the quarter-finals.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Colombia defender Davinson Sanchez celebrates his goal against Costa Rica. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759547_1_20240629093722.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombia marched into the quarter-finals of the Copa America on Friday with a confident 3-0 victory over Costa Rica in Arizona.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Goals from Luis Diaz, Davinson Sanchez and Jhon Cordoba sealed all three points for the Colombians, who are now guaranteed a top two-finish in Group D.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil in their final group game next Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Colombians will head into that game brimming with confidence after extending their unbeaten streak to 25 games at Glendale's State Farm Stadium on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nestor Lorenzo's well-organised side have not lost since a defeat to Argentina in February 2022, and never looked like surrendering that record on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool star Diaz opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after Costa Rica goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira inexplicably crashed into Jhon Cordoba on the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diaz stepped up to smash an emphatic spot-kick into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia almost doubled their tally on 37 minutes, with veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picking out Diaz at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diaz poked a cross into the six-yard area but center-back Davinson Sanchez just couldn't get a touch to guide the ball into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made no such mistake in the 59th minute, however, as he glanced in Jhon Arias's cross from the left to make it 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cordoba then grabbed Colombia's third on 62 minutes with the best goal of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exquisite through ball from Rodriguez split the Costa Rica defence and sent Cordoba racing in on goal, the 31-year-old whipping a shot across goal into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Friday's other Copa America game, Brazil take on Paraguay in Las Vegas hoping to get their first win of the tournament after an opening 0-0 draw with Costa Rica. (AFP)

    River Seine fails water quality tests before Olympics

<div class="itemFullText">
 The river Seine is still failing water quality tests one month before the Paris Olympics when it is scheduled to host the open-water swimming competition and the swimming leg of the triathlon, results showed Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latest tests, completed last week and released by the Paris mayor's office, showed levels of the E.Coli bacteria – an indicator of faecal matter – are far above the upper limits imposed by sports federations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water quality remains degraded because of unfavourable hydrological conditions, little sunshine, below-average seasonal temperatures and upstream pollution," the mayor's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities have spent 1.4 billion euros (US$1.5 billion) in the last decade trying to clean up the river by improving the Paris sewerage system, as well as building new water treatment and storage facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But major storms still overwhelm the capital's waste water network, some of which dates back to the 19th century, leading to discharges of untreated sewage directly into the river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers insist that some dry weather and sunshine in July should be sufficient to make the Seine fit for the outdoor swimming events. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Los Angeles Lakers selected Bronny James to form a father-son duo with future Hall of Famer LeBron James in the most monumental second-round pick in recent NBA history Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The guard from Southern California will join a Lakers team that's hoping to convince LeBron James, 39, to finish his storied NBA career in purple and gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The younger James was picked 55th overall out of 58 picks in the two-round NBA draft. The second round was held on its own day for the first time this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time NBA Most Valuable Player LeBron James, the 39-year-old Lakers playmaker who is a four-time NBA champion, has previously said he would like to play alongside his son next season
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bronny James, 19, had private workouts with only two teams before the draft: the Lakers and the Phoenix Suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was widely believed that the Lakers were planning to pair him with his father despite Bronny James' one lacklustre season of college basketball. He suffered cardiac arrest the July before his freshman season and only entered game action in December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game in 25 college games. (Reuters/AFP)

 India hammered defending champions England by 68 runs in Guyana on Thursday to set up a T20 World Cup final showdown against South Africa.
 <br>
  <br/>
  England, who beat India by 10 wickets in the 2022 semi-finals, collapsed to 103 all out chasing 172 for victory, with spinners Kuldeep Yadav [3-19] and Axar Patel [3-23] sharing six wickets between them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, India posted 171-7 in a rain-interrupted innings after losing the toss with captain Rohit Sharma making 57 – his third fifty of the tournament – and Suryakumar Yadav 47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Africa overwhelmed Afghanistan by nine wickets in the first semi-final on Wednesday to book their place in Saturday's final in Barbados.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both India and South Africa have yet to lose a match at this tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India will be bidding for their first major title since winning the 2013 Champions Trophy, having lost on home soil to Australia in last year's 50-over World Cup final. (AFP)

    'Unbeatable' Pogacar aiming for Tour-Giro double

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Team Emirates' Tadej Pogacar during the teams presentation. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759382_1_20240628080644.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Race favourite Tadej Pogacar was on Thursday hailed as "unbeatable" even as he revealed he contracted Covid just 10 days ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Winner of the 2020 and 2021 Tour de France, the Slovenian won the Giro d'Italia last month and is hoping to become the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 – the year Pogacar was born – to win the rare combination of a Tour-Giro double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Giro-Tour double is difficult to achieve. It's a big challenge but I'm ready to take it on," the Team UAE rider said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The challenge will be made even tougher by the presence in the peloton of two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard, the Dane who pushed him into the runner-up spot in the past two editions, as well as two other leading contenders, Primoz Roglic and Remco Evenepoel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgian rider Evenepoel deemed Pogacar "unbeatable" if he remains "safe and sound" but that dose of Covid may just have sapped some of the strength from his legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I fell ill 10 days ago," Pogacar told a press conference in Florence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had Covid and there was a little question mark but I am fully recovered. It wasn't so bad. It was just a cold that passed quite quickly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visma rider Vingegaard, 27, was not reading too much into the news of Pogacar's Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It depends if it was a bad dose," said the Dane. "I don't know how much it will take out of him, but it doesn't sound perfect." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa thrashed Afghanistan by nine wickets to reach the final of the T20 Cricket World Cup for the first time on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After skittling Afghanistan for 56 at Trinidad's Brian Lara Stadium, the Proteas cruised to their victory target, finishing on 60-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Africa's left-arm wrist-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi [3 for 6] and pacer Marco Jansen [3-16] spearheaded the demolition of a suspect Afghanistan batting line-up for just 56 off 11.5 overs after they chose to bat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje maintained the relentless pressure with two wickets apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a surface which encouraged all bowlers but left Afghanistan with too little to defend, South Africa lost Quinton de Kock early in reply for Fazalhaq Farooqi's tournament-leading 17th wicket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Reeza Hendricks [29 not out] and captain Aiden Markram [23 not out] saw South Africa to victory at 60 for one off 8.5 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Proteas advance to Saturday's showpiece occasion in Barbados where they will face the winners of Thursday's second semi-final between title-holders England and unbeaten India in Guyana. (AFP)

    French players make history at NBA Draft

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Zaccharie Risacher, right, with NBA commissioner Adam Silver. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759242_1_20240627105949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Zaccharie Risacher was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the first overall pick in Wednesday's opening round of the NBA Draft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old forward, who stands 6-foot-9 (2.06m), was the second Frenchman in a row to be chosen number one after Victor Wembanyama was taken by the San Antonio Spurs with the top pick last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a blessing, you know," Risacher said. "So exciting. There are a lot of feelings and emotions right now. I don't know what to say but it's definitely special."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French players were chosen with three of the top six picks overall, setting an NBA record for the most international players taken in the top 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risacher helped spark JL Bourg to this year's EuroCup final, which was won by Paris Basketball.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became the second-youngest player to be named the EuroCup Rising Star and last month was named the French league's 2023-24 Best Young Player after averaging 10.1 points and 3.8 rebounds in 22 minutes a game for JL Bourg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French 19-year-old centre Alexandre Sarr was selected second overall by the Washington Wizards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sarr played last season for the Perth Wildcats of Australia's National Basketball League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two seasons with Real Madrid's youth team and two US youth seasons, he spent the 2023-24 campaign with Perth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everywhere I played it just built me for this moment," Sarr said. "It's so special."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It marks only the third time in NBA history that the top two picks in the draft have not had US college experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sky is the limit for talented French rookies after Wembanyama went on to be named the NBA Rookie of the Year and led the league in blocked shots last season. (AP)

    Roglic leads Red Bull lineup for Tour de France

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull on Wednesday unveiled its eight-rider cycling team to debut in this week's Tour de France, marking the energy drink maker's latest expansion of its sports empire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, Red Bull bought a controlling stake in the German Bora-Hansgrohe cycling team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The arrival of Red Bull in cycling... it's really huge. I think we have so much potential in the future with this joint venture," said team manager Ralph Denk at the official launch of the team at Red Bull's Hangar-7 facility in the Austrian city of Salzburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a clear plan to become the most attractive brand in cycling," said Denk when asked about his vision for the new team, adding that this would include finding "icon riders" and focussing on the development of young talents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team will compete in dark-blue jerseys prominently featuring the drink maker's logo and ride "super aero" bikes in white.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will be led by Slovenia's veteran all-rounder Primoz Roglic, who has previously won the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espana and also claimed his second Criterium du Dauphine earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former ski jumper Roglic left Jumbo-Visma to ride for Bora, starting 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's entry as a new sponsor "is a game changer or a big change for the whole [sport of] cycling," said Roglic, whose new contract is said to be worth 6 million euros (US$6.4 million) a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star-packed Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe roster for the world's biggest cycling race also includes Australian former Giro winner Jai Hindley and Russian Aleksandr Vlasov.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour de France starts in Florence on Saturday and is expected to be a four-way struggle spearheaded by bitter rivals Tadej Pogacar from Slovenia and Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard across a route designed to take the world's greatest bike race down to the wire. (AFP)

    Raducanu saves match point, Keys advances

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Raducanu reacts during her second round match against Jessica Pegula. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759216_1_20240627081335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Emma Raducanu registered her first-ever victory over a top-10 player at the Eastbourne International on Wednesday, saving a match point on the way to upsetting second seed Jessica Pegula as Madison Keys cruised through.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former US Open champion Raducanu edged a tight second-set tie-break to level the match against her American opponent and held her nerve to win 4-6, 7-6 [8/6], 7-5 after a major wobble in the decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raducanu, who missed the entire grass-court season last year following surgery, opted not to play in qualifying for the French Open or at the Paris Olympics but has a wild card for Wimbledon, which starts next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raducanu, who saved a match point in the second-set tie-break, appeared to be cantering towards victory when she led 5-2 in the third set but Pegula, who won the Berlin grass-court tournament last week, broke twice to level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former British number one, now ranked 168th in the world, carved out a break of her own to edge ahead again and survived a clutch of break points to seal the win, setting up a quarter-final tie with Daria Kasatkina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending champion and fourth seed Keys beat Ukrainian qualifier Anhelina Kalinina 7-6 [7/5], 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American will next face 2023 French Open finalist Karolina Muchova, who is playing her first tournament for nine months, after the Czech eased past Polish qualifier Magda Linette 6-4, 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Katie Boulter continued her fine form on grass by putting out fifth seed and former champion Jelena Ostapenko 6-4, 7-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British number one, who won the Nottingham tournament earlier this month, will take on third seed Jasmine Paolini in the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's event, Australia's Aleksandar Vukic put out third seed Alexander Bublik 6-4, 6-4 while fourth seed Sebastian Baez exited in straight sets at the hands of Miomir Kecmanovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese teenager Shang Juncheng beat Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 and will meet top seed and two-time American former champion Taylor Fritz, who produced a serving masterclass to defeat Thiago Seyboth Wild 7-6 [7/4], 6-3. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia secured a historic place in the knockout stages of Euro 2024 after a stunning 2-0 win over Portugal on Wednesday, while Turkey, Belgium, Romania and Slovakia all advanced to the last 16 as the group stage came to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Appearing at their first European Championship, Georgia had to record their first ever victory at the tournament to reach the last 16 when they played Portugal in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal had already qualified for the last 16 as Group F winners, and their coach Roberto Martinez made eight changes to his team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia went ahead inside the opening two minutes thanks to a fine finish from their star player, Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georges Mikautadze, who set up that goal, made it 2-0 from the penalty spot early in the second half to become the competition's top scorer on three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia, ranked 74th in the world, will now play much-fancied Spain in the next round on Sunday in Cologne, having progressed as one of the four best third-placed sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey finished second in the same group after a 2-1 win over the Czech Republic in Hamburg, as their opponents were eliminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cenk Tosun's goal in stoppage time sealed the victory for Turkey, who had been playing with an extra man since the 20th-minute sending-off of Antonin Barak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hakan Calhanoglu's superb strike put Turkey ahead early in the second half, before Tomas Soucek levelled for the Czechs, for whom Tomas Chory was also shown red after the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey will play Austria in the last 16 in Leipzig next Tuesday, while 2016 champions Portugal go to Frankfurt for a game on Monday against Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, in a dramatic finish to Group E, war-torn Ukraine were left heartbroken as they went out despite picking up four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania's 1-1 draw with Slovakia secured the point they both needed to progress, while Ukraine's brave effort in a 0-0 draw with Belgium was not enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four sides ended the section on four points, but Ukraine paid for their 3-0 defeat to Romania in their opening game as they finished bottom on goal difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium could be made to pay for making a meal of a group they were expected to cruise as Domenico Tedesco's men will face France in the last 16 after finishing second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia advance as one of the best third-placed sides and will meet England next in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania will take on the Netherlands in the last 16. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England grounded out a 0-0 draw with Slovenia to claim top spot in Group C and avoid a last-16 meeting with hosts Germany, but France face a complicated path to the final after failing to beat Poland on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gareth Southgate's side have struggled to find their best form in the tournament and delivered another unimpressive performance in Cologne, one that will do little to silence the mounting criticism back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was still enough to advance as group winners though after an equally turgid 0-0 draw between Denmark and Serbia in Munich, which saw the Danes finish second ahead of Slovenia despite an identical record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England must wait to find out which of the four best third-placed teams they will meet in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday for a place in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark pipped Slovenia to the runners-up spot by virtue of a better qualifying ranking after both nations finished with three draws, the same goal difference, number of goals scored and disciplinary points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany await Denmark in the last 16, while Slovenia celebrated reaching the knockout phase of a major tournament for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France blew the chance to finish first in their group despite Kylian Mbappe scoring his maiden goal from the spot in a 1-1 draw with Poland, as Austria won a thriller against the Netherlands to snatch top spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria, who lost their opening game to France, grabbed a 3-2 victory over the Dutch to wrap up a last-16 berth and relegate their already-qualified opponents to third place in Group D.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Les Bleus will face the runners-up from Group E in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result of coming second, France also now find themselves in the half of the draw with Germany, Spain and Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe -- playing in a mask after breaking his nose against Austria -- finally broke his Euros duck in the 56th minute, as he slotted in a penalty after Ousmane Dembele was felled by Jakub Kiwior.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Poland were awarded a spot-kick themselves with 13 minutes remaining for a foul on Karol Swiderski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Dutch fans turned Berlin orange as they continued to light up the tournament, it was the Austrians in full voice early on when Donyell Malen inadvertently fired into his own net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Netherlands drew level less than two minutes after the restart, as Austria midfielder Florian Grillitsch lost the ball in midfield before Cody Gakpo cut inside and finished off a rapid counter-attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria reclaimed the lead as Romano Schmid's header found the net via a deflection off Stefan de Vrij on the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Memphis Depay struck with an excellent touch and volley to equalise again after a good header down by substitute Wout Weghorst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ralf Rangnick's men now have a match against either Turkey, the Czech Republic or Georgia as they bid to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands will play the winners of either Groups C or E. (AFP)

    Top Spanish court says 'stolen kiss' is sexual assault

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former football federation chief Luis Rubiales faces trial for kissing star player Jenni Hermoso on the lips after Spain beat England to win the World Cup last year. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759024_1_20240626003012.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that a kiss without "tacit consent" can be considered sexual assault just months before former football federation chief Luis Rubiales will stand trial over his unsolicited kiss at the Women's World Cup.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling from the southern region of Andalusia which convicted a police officer of sexual assault and sentenced him to one year and nine months in jail for kissing a woman on the cheek who was in police custody.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A 'stolen kiss', and thus without express or implied consent, constitutes sexual assault in actuality," the court said, adding that "it is clear that the fleeting contact of a non-consensual kiss represents a bodily invasion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A 'no' from the victim is not necessary in the face of attempts to kiss a woman, but rather that for there not to be a crime, what is needed is consent. The key is consent, to the point that if consent has not been given, there has been sexual aggression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of whether an unsolicited kiss can be considered sexual assault is a hot topic in Spain since Rubiales provoked worldwide outrage by kissing star player Jenni Hermoso on the lips during the medal ceremony after Spain beat England to win the World Cup in Australia last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the time, Rubiales, 46, brushed it off as "a consensual" peck on the lips, but Hermoso, 34, said it was not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She filed a lawsuit against Rubiales in September, telling the judge she had come under pressure to defend him both on the flight back from Australia and on a subsequent team holiday to Ibiza in the Balearic Islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rubiales is set to stand trial from February 3 to 19 over the kiss. Public prosecutors have requested a sentence of two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales – one year for sexual assault and 18 months for coercion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former federation chief, who quit his post last year in the wake of the controversy, told private Spanish television station La Sexta in April that he could not understand how it could be labelled as sexual assault, saying there was "no sexual context" to it. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Afghanistan reached the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup with a dramatic eight-run victory over Bangladesh under the Duckworth Lewis System in St Vincent on Monday, joining India as the qualifiers from Group 1 and sending Australia home.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh also had a chance to progress or send Australia through with a victory but the Afghans dismissed them for 105 to take the win they needed to set up a first World Cup semi-final against South Africa in Trinidad on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan hopes were dented when they were restricted to a modest 115-5 as showers around the ground threatened to change the calculations, but skipper Rashid Khan took 4-23 and Naveen-ul-Haq 4-26 in a defiant bowling effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India, who beat Australia by 24 runs earlier in St Lucia to leave the qualification hopes of the 2021 champions hanging by a thread, will take on title holders England in the second semi-final in Guyana on Thursday. (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758940_1_20240625130752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lacklustre Brazil launched their Copa America campaign with a dour 0-0 draw against Costa Rica on Monday as James Rodriguez inspired Colombia to a 2-1 win over Paraguay in the other Group D game.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Brazil, chasing a 10th Copa America crown, dominated possession and territory at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles but struggled to break down a resolute Costa Rica.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Brazilians thought they had taken the lead in the 30th minute after Marquinhos tapped in at the back post after a flick on by Rodrygo following a free-kick by Raphinha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after an agonising VAR delay, the goal was chalked off for a fractional offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costa Rica were content to sit back, defending in numbers and rarely venturing forward with any purpose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They failed to have a single shot on goal for the entire game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodriguez, whose club career has languished in the decade since he rose to prominence with a dazzling performance at the 2014 World Cup, created both of Colombia's goals at Houston in Texas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old midfielder, who has played just a handful of minutes for Brazilian club Sao Paulo in the two months leading into the Copa America, set up the opening goal for Colombia in the 32nd minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten minutes later Colombia doubled their lead and again it was a goal engineered by the trusty left foot of Rodriguez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time the goal arrived from the opposite flank, with Rodriguez swinging in a wicked free-kick that was glanced in by Crystal Palace midfielder Jefferson Lerma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That made it 2-0 at half time to leave Colombia firmly on course to extend their unbeaten streak to 24 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia continued to carve out the better chances in the second half, but Paraguay set up a nervy finish after Brighton's Julio Enciso pulled one back in the 69th minute. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Florida Panthers dug deep against the Edmonton Oilers to win 2-1 in a closely-fought Game 7, ensuring their first ever Stanley Cup title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sam Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe scored goals for the home team while Sergei Bobrovsky made 23 saves on their way to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mattias Janmark had the goal for Edmonton and Stuart Skinner stopped 19 shots for the Oilers, but they couldn’t end Canada’s title drought in the tournament; it’s been 1993 and counting since a team based in Canada has won the Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Florida, it was the third title-round appearance in their 30-year history; they were swept in 1996 by Colorado and routed 4-1 by Vegas last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, they were on the right side of history — after avoiding what would have been a historic collapse. The Panthers won the first three games of the series, then lost the next three and needed a win on Monday to avoid joining the 1942 Detroit Red Wings as the only teams to lose the final after taking a 3-0 lead in the title round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn’t easy. Not even close. But it's done. It took until the very end for the Panthers to deny Connor McDavid his first title, and the Oilers what would have been their first Cup since 2006. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungary's forward Barnabas Varga had successful surgery on Monday after suffering a facial fracture in Sunday's 1-0 win over Scotland at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old suffered the injury when he clashed with Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn in the box after 68 minutes and appeared to be knocked out, needing urgent medical attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was taken to hospital and was in a stable condition before his surgery on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information of the institution's doctors specialising in facial injuries, the intervention was uncomplicated, so the attacker ... can leave the hospital on Wednesday," the Hungarian football federation said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga's girlfriend shared a picture of her holding his hand in hospital with the message: "Thank you for the kind, supportive messages. Barni is over the surgery. A little rest awaits him, but everything will be fine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai had criticised medical staff for the length of time it took for Varga to get treatment on the pitch during the Group A game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga will not play any part in the rest of Hungary's campaign, should they qualify for the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win over Scotland ensured Hungary finished third in their group, but they must wait on other results to see if they qualify as one of the four best third-place finishers. (Reuters)

    Last-gasp Zaccagni saves Italy as Spain top group

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mattia Zaccagni kept Italy's European Championship title defence alive with an incredible late equaliser in the holder's thrilling 1-1 draw with Croatia, as Spain completed a perfect group stage and showed Albania the door.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Italy are in the last 16 of Euro 2024 after forward Zaccagni struck a superb equaliser with almost the last kick of the game in Leipzig, sparking an explosion of joy among the Italian fans and even a sprint up the line from 65-year-old coach Luciano Spalletti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Azzurri will play Switzerland in the next round thanks to Zaccagni, who came on with nine minutes remaining and curled in his leveller in the eighth minute of stoppage time following a brilliant burst and pass from defender Riccardo Calafiori.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody believed any more, but the players did," Spalletti told Sky Sport in Italy, before raging at critics in the Italian press pack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a furious press conference Spalletti said "I inject myself with this venom" which he said was coming "from all sides" and blasted unnamed people within Italy's camp for potentially leaking his team's formation to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spalletti's team finish Group B in second place on four points, five behind winners Spain who beat Albania 1-0 thanks to a neat Ferran Torres finish in the 13th minute in Dusseldorf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albania's Euros adventure is over following a defeat which also means that England, France and the Netherlands are guaranteed a place in the next round at least as one of the four best third-placed teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia meanwhile are all-but out due to Zaccagni's late equaliser just as it looked as if Luka Modric was once again going to be the hero for his country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modric defied his advancing years by firing Croatia into the lead nine minutes after the break and becoming the oldest goalscorer in Euros history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 38 years and 289 days old, Modric broke the record set by Austrian Ivica Vastic in 2008, pouncing on a rebound after Gianluigi Donnarumma made an incredible save from Ante Budimir's point-blank range header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modric made up for Donnarumma pushing away his penalty just moments before, but his goal wasn't enough and on two points third-placed Croatia's hopes are hanging by a thread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's hard when you lose like this to find the words to describe how you feel," said Modric. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rohit Sharma led from the front with a blistering 92 as India beat Australia by 24 runs in St Lucia on Monday to seal their place in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The India captain's dashing innings – he faced just 41 balls, including seven fours and eight sixes – was the cornerstone of a total of 205-5 made after he lost the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia eventually finished their reply on 181-7, with left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh taking 3-37.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India will now face defending champions England in Thursday's semi-final in Guyana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat meant Australia's fate was no longer in their own hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan, who produced a stunning upset in beating Australia by 21 runs last time out, will qualify for the semi-finals if they defeat Bangladesh later on Monday in the concluding Group One game of the Super Eights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia lost David Warner for just six when the veteran left-handed opener was undone by a full-length delivery from Arshdeep that he could only edge to Suryakumar Yadav at slip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Travis Head, whose superb century crushed Indian dreams of a 50-over World Cup final win on home soil last year, kept Australia in the hunt with a well-made 76 off 43 balls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His second-wicket stand of 81 with skipper Mitchell Marsh looked to be turning the tide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Marsh was brilliantly caught one-handed on the boundary by a leaping Axar Patel off Kuldeep Yadav for 37.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep then bowled dangerman Glenn Maxwell for 20 with a superb 'wrong-un' on his way to fine figures of 2-24 in his maximum four overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And when Head holed out off a superbly-disguised slower ball from paceman Jasprit Bumrah, Australia were all but beaten at 150-5 in the 17th over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, India star batsman Virat Kohli holed out for a five-ball duck off Josh Hazlewood, with Tim David taking a fine running catch over his shoulder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fellow opener Rohit then cut loose. He was particularly severe on Mitchell Starc, the only change to the Australia team following their upset defeat by Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hit the left-arm fast bowler for 29 runs in a third over where he struck four sixes – two in successive balls over extra-cover, a monster hit over deep midwicket and a top-edged full toss over the wicketkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with Rohit threatening the first hundred of this tournament, Starc bowled him with an excellent yorker. (AFP)

    England spinner Bashir concedes 38 runs in one over

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England spinner Shoaib Bashir made unwanted history on Monday when he conceded 38 runs in a single over in an English county championship match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Bashir, playing for Worcestershire, was put away for five straight sixes by England teammate Dan Lawrence, playing for Surrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sixth ball of Bashir’s over was sent so far down the leg side that it went for five wides, and there was worse to follow for Bashir when he overstepped with his next delivery, giving away a no-ball – and therefore two runs – along with a single for Lawrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Lawrence off strike, Bashir actually managed a dot ball with his last delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It tied the most expensive over in County Championship history. Alex Tudor also conceded 38 runs for Surrey against Lancashire in 1998, with former England allrounder Andrew Flintoff hitting 34 of the runs on that occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was only the 12th first-class match for Bashir, who made his England test debut on the tour of India in February and March. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Épée fencer Cedric Ho won gold at the Asian Champions in Kuwait on Sunday, as he steps up preparations for a first Olympics appearance in Paris this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an all-Hong Kong showdown for the gold medal, Ho edged out fellow SAR fencer Ng Ho-tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a final bout that swung one way then the next, Ho came out on top 15-14 to capture his first gold medal at an Asian Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng's silver also represented his best-ever result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the semi-finals, Ho earned a hard-fought victory over Kazakhstan's Yerlik Sertay. After falling behind early in the bout, he won four points in a row to build a lead he would not surrender – eventually winning 15-13. Ng, meanwhile, defeated Japan's world number 20 Akira Komata 10-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho will be representing the SAR at the upcoming Paris Olympics.

    South Korea's Amy Yang wins Women's PGA Championship

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Amy Yang lines up a putt on hole eighteen during the final round. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758734_1_20240624081847.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Amy Yang of South Korea held off the field at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship for her first career major title on Sunday in Sammamish, Wash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old Yang, who arrived at Sahalee Country Club on Sunday morning with a two-shot lead through 54 holes, shot an even-par 72 to card a 7-under 281 for the week. She defeated Lilia Vu [71 Sunday], Jin Young Ko of South Korea [71] and Miyu Yamashita of Japan [73] by three shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang had five prior victories on the LPGA Tour, most notably at the CME Group Tour Championship last November. She twice finished as a major runner-up, at the 2012 and 2015 U.S. Women's Open tournaments. This week was her 75th start in a major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I always wanted to win a major and I came close several times, and I started doubting myself if I'm ever gonna win a major before I retire, because I've been on tour quite a while," Yang said. "I am so grateful and very, very happy to win a major."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang at one point held a seven-shot advantage over the field. Her fifth and final birdie of the day, a 4-foot birdie tap at the par-3 13th hole, put her at 10 under when the next-closest golfers stood at 3 under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a bogey at the par-4 16th, Yang landed her tee shot at the par-3 17th into the water. She made double bogey to slip to 7 under but still had plenty of cushion for the final hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all the hard work our team did together and I'm so grateful for that. All four rounds it was tough out there, but I just trusted what I prepared and I did my best all week," said Yang, who shot 70-68-71-72 during a week when only 13 players finished under par.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vu, who won last week's Meijer LPGA Classic, birdied her final hole to forge a tie with Ko for second place. Yamashita joined them with a birdie on the last hole as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vu is the No. 2 player in the world rankings and won two majors last season. She said she was not surprised Yang sailed so far ahead of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite no major on her resume before Sunday, Yang moved into sixth all-time in LPGA career earnings by taking home the US$1.56 million winner's check. (Reuters)

    England thrash USA to reach T20 World Cup semi-finals

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England captain Jos Buttler hits a four. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758733_1_20240624081309.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chris Jordan took four wickets in five balls, including the third hat-trick of the T20 World Cup, as defending champions England qualified for the semi-finals with a 10-wicket thrashing of the United States in his native Barbados on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 35-year-old all-rounder, born and educated on the Caribbean island, justified his recall for this match in spectacular fashion with the remarkable figures of 4-10 in 2.5 overs as the United States were dismissed for 115.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England captain Jos Buttler then led from the front in a blistering chase with an unbeaten 83, featuring five sixes in an over from Harmeet Singh, as his side raced to their target in a mere 9.4 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By winning so quickly, England secured a place in the last four, regardless of the outcome of Sunday's final Group Two Super Eights match between co-hosts the West Indies and South Africa in Antigua and any associated net run-rate calculations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buttler faced just 38 balls, including six fours and seven sixes, but the day belonged to Jordan, whose hat-trick was the third of this tournament, with Australia's Pat Cummins achieving the feat against both Bangladesh and Afghanistan, and the first by an England bowler in any men's T20 international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unbelievable feeling, more importantly to restrict USA and to do it in a special place like this is always nice," said Jordan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Been on a hat-trick a few times, nice to get it on target this time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buttler added: "I wanted to bring CJ back in to add a little bit of depth to the batting and we know what he is capable of with the ball. He executed it fantastically well, and a World Cup hat-trick is a great effort."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for his own form, Buttler said: "Personally it's really important I continue this into the semi-finals. I have been feeling good all year, I feel I am hitting the ball well and it is nice to get that confidence." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany survived a scare to finish top of Group A at Euro 2024 as Niclas Fuellkrug's stoppage-time goal rescued a 1-1 draw against Switzerland, while Scotland were eliminated after a last-gasp 1-0 defeat against Hungary whose striker Barnabas Varga suffered a sickening injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dan Ndoye's first-half goal in Frankfurt had put Switzerland on course to climb above hosts Germany into top spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fuellkrug's late header ensured Julian Nagelsmann's side advanced to the last 16 in pole position with seven points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Germans, who last won the Euros in 1996, will take on the Group C runners-up – currently slated to be Denmark – in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark, two points behind leaders England, play Serbia in their last group game on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany are also on track for a potential quarter-final clash with Spain, who have been among the best teams at the tournament so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland, who reached the quarter-finals at the last Euros in 2021, have now made the knockout stage in six successive major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Group A runners-up with five points, the Swiss will face the second-placed team in Group B in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Stuttgart, Scotland were unable to secure the victory that would likely have taken them into the knockout stage of a major tournament for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Clarke's team, who lost to Germany and drew with Switzerland in their first two games, were sunk by a goal 10 minutes into stoppage-time from Kevin Csoboth, whose clinical finish capped a rapid raid from the Hungarians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary may not secure a last 16 berth despite their victory as they have only three points from their three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four third-placed teams with the best records from the six groups will move into the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary's win came at a cost as Varga was stretchered off after a sickening collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga collapsed to the pitch and was struggling to move after chasing a long cross into the area as Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn came to collect the ball.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a long delay, medics took the 29-year-old from the pitch while a sheet was draped around the stretcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai appeared to be in tears as he consoled his stricken teammate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga was immediately taken to hospital after the incident where he was said to be conscious and talking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The condition of Barnabas Varga is stable," the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hungarian national team player is currently in one of the hospitals in Stuttgart. We will inform you immediately if there is any news on his status." (AFP)

 Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen won the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday from McLaren's pole-sitter Lando Norris to extend his lead in the world championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lewis Hamilton completed the podium at the Barcelona-Catalunya circuit for the Mercedes seven-time former champion's first podium of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The racing may be closer than the past two seasons but Verstappen always seems to pull it out of the bag when it matters most.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was his 61st career win, seventh of the season, and fourth at the track he first shot onto the F1 scene as a teenager in 2016. (AFP)

 Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran shared an opening stand of 118 before Gulbadin Naib took over to drive Afghanistan to a 21-run win over Australia in St Vincent on Saturday and keep alive their hopes of reaching the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A win for Australia would have sent the 2021 champions and India into the last four, but even a second hat-trick in as many matches from Pat Cummins was not enough to keep their unbeaten record at the tournament intact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half centuries from Gurbaz and Zadran helped the Afghans rack up 148-6 in their 20 overs, before their bowlers dismissed the Australians for 127 on a tricky Kingstown track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naib claimed 4-20 and Naveen-ul-Haq bagged 3-20, but it was the third century partnership of the tournament from Gurbaz and Zadran that laid the foundation for a win that also kept Bangladesh alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've waited for a long time (for this)," said man-of-the-match Naib.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a big moment for our nation and our people. I have no words, but thanks to the fans who supported us in our career and cricket journey ... thank God we finally beat Australia. It's a great achievement for Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have achieved many things in the last 10 years, but this is big."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India top Group 1 on four points, ahead of Australia and Afghanistan on two, with Bangladesh alone in last place, with none.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India and Australia face off in St Lucia on Monday, while the Afghans stay in St Vincent to play Bangladesh in the final Super Eight match later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia skipper Mitchell Marsh won the toss and sprang a couple of surprises by sending the Afghans in to bat and naming a team with left-arm spinner Ashton Agar in the bowling line-up in place of Mitchell Starc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the early overs it looked like the Australian bowlers would suffocate the Afghans, but the lack of a breakthrough wicket allowed Gurbaz and Zadran to settle in and accelerate through the middle overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crisp batting and hard running from the Afghans put the pressure back on the Australians, who made uncharacteristic fielding errors under the Arnos Vale Ground lights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair reached their half-centuries before Marcus Stoinis finally separated them in the 16th over, when Gurbaz mistimed a shot to David Warner at deep square leg to depart for 60.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spinner Adam Zampa removed Azmatullah Omarzai (2) and Zadran (51) in the following over and paceman Cummins sent back skipper Rashid Khan cheaply with the final ball of the 18th over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Karim Janat and Naib followed with the first two deliveries of the 20th over as Cummins became the first bowler to take two hat-tricks at a T20 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He would have taken four wickets in a row had Warner held onto a reasonably straightforward catch running in from deep point to dismiss Nangeyalia Kharote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They got 20 runs too many," admitted Marsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be honest, they played a really good game of cricket. We were outplayed tonight ... It was an off-night in the field and we own that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan made the best possible start with ball in hand with Naveen bowling Travis Head for a duck in the opening over and having Marsh caught in the deep for 12 in the third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warner followed for three off Mohammad Nabi's first delivery to leave the Australians struggling on 32-3 in the final over of the power play, before the Afghans heaped more pressure on their opponents by removing Stoinis and Tim David.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The explosive Glenn Maxwell gave Australia some hope with a battling 59 off 41 balls, but his dismissal by Naib, thanks to an acrobatic catch by Noor Ahmad, all but sealed the fate of the former champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I learnt from the batting innings on how to bowl," added Naib, who also took a low diving catch to dismiss Ashton Agar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to Rashid for trusting me, it's a team effort, Rahmanullah, Zadran and also Naveen for the momentum." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Portugal cruised to a 3-0 win against Turkey on Saturday and booked their spot in the Euro 2024 last 16 as Group F winners thanks to a Bernardo Silva strike, an own-goal by Samet Akaydin and a Bruno Fernandes tap-in.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Silva scored his first goal in a major international tournament in the 21st minute when a cross from Nuno Mendes deflected off a Turkish defender to find the Manchester City forward ghosting alone in the area, who then smashed it past the goalkeeper to put the Portuguese ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven minutes later, Turkish defender Akaydin made a comical mistake as he tried to play the ball back to his goalkeeper who was out of position and there was nothing he could to stop it from rolling into the net despite their desperate attempts to keep it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal kept dominating and extended their lead after substitute Ruben Neves set Cristiano Ronaldo free with a long ball to beat the offside line and, after drawing in the goalkeeper, squared the ball for Fernandes who only had to tap it into an empty goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win lifts Portugal to a guaranteed first place in Group F on six points, three ahead Turkey in second and five ahead of Georgia and Czech Republic with one game to go. (Reuters)

    Belgium defeat Romania in action-packed game

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Belgium's Kevin De Bruyne celebrates scoring his team's second goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758638_1_20240623073158.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A goal by Youri Tielemans after 73 seconds and a late one for Kevin De Bruyne gave Belgium a 2-0 win over Romania in an incredible, action-packed game on Saturday that set up a final round showdown with all four teams in Group E on three points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was a Euro 2024 Saturday night special played in an astonishing atmosphere in Cologne, with the only mystery being how there were only two goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It meant that, for the first time in European Championship history, all four teams in a group are on equal points after two rounds, following Ukraine's 2-1 win over Slovakia on Friday. All outcomes are now available on the final night on Wednesday when Belgium play Ukraine and Slovakia play Romania, where four points could be enough to top the group but could also see a team eliminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania and Belgium have the advantage with a plus-one goal difference. Slovakia are on zero and Ukraine on -2 - with those goal differences the deciding factor should both games end level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were very relieved we won the game, it was very important to get three points," said Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco. "Romania gave us a bit more space that Slovakia but with the quality and quantity of our chances it would have been good if we could have scored more early on - four or five goals tonight would have been possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium, still somehow ranked third in the world by FIFA, were unrecognisable from the sluggish side shocked by Slovakia in their opening game, pouring forward and full of energy from the first whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It paid dividends immediately as Romelu Lukaku held up the ball with his back to goal before rolling it into the path of Tielemans, who drilled home a crisp, low shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes later Romania went close with a header by Radu Dragusin that Koen Casteels saved well, but it was a brief respite as Belgium ran the first-half show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dodi Lukebakio’s fierce shot was well saved by Florin Nita after a trademark carving run by man of the match De Bruyne, while Lukebakio and Amadou Onana both blazed over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seemed only a matter of time before they scored again, but Romania weathered the storm and, knowing how they struck so devastatingly on the counter to beat Ukraine, did not panic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their fans certainly stayed behind them, helping create an amazing atmosphere as noise rained down from all four stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waves of Belgian attacks continued though, as Jeremy Doku fizzed a cross inches from Lukaku’s head, De Bruyne curled just past a post then had another shot smothered by Nita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukaku thought he had got the second after an hour, slotting home confidently from a De Bruyne through ball, only for VAR to rule it out for offside – five days after he had two goals chalked off against Slovakia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incredible end-to-end action continued with Dennis Man clean through for Romania only to shoot wastefully straight at Casteels and then, incredibly, it was the Belgian keeper who set up the second 10 minutes from time with a Sunday league, route one goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He launched a goal kick that evaded everyone and the ever-switched on De Bruyne seized on it to tuck the ball home for what could prove a priceless goal should the calculators be needed to split the teams next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania, of course, are also still in the hunt to reach the knockout stage for only the second time, having failed to even qualify for the last six World Cups following their golden era of the 1990s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a great start to the tournament, now let's see how we deal with difficulty. We need solidarity and unity because we are still first in the group," their coach Edward Iordanescu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a most complicated group - a third goal would have been really bad for us." (AFP)

    Georgia in historic draw against Czechs at Euro 2024

<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili hailed his team's "historic" first ever point after a thrilling 1-1 draw against the Czech Republic at Euro 2024 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Georges Mikautadze struck from the penalty spot for the Euros debutants in the first half in Hamburg but Patrik Schick levelled for the Czechs after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valencia stopper Mamardashvili made 11 saves in a brilliant display and was named player of the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an opening defeat by Turkey, the draw means Georgia will likely have to beat one of the tournament favourites Portugal in their third match to progress from Group F.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am quite happy and satisfied just for being here... our first point is a historic moment," Mamardashvili told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia might even have won the game at the death against the run of play, but after being sent in on goal, substitute Saba Lobjanidze hammered over the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Atalanta United winger's team-mates and Georgia coach Willy Sagnol went to him at the end to try and raise his spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the three-and-a-half years I've been coaching Georgia, we've done a lot of very positive things on the pitch, but it's also a massive and very important human experience for me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagnol said his squad had mixed feelings at full-time after claiming their first point but seeing two more slip between their fingers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know if the point is deserved, but for everything we've done together, I think it's deserved." he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech coach Ivan Hasek said it was a scary moment for his side, who had dominated the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last seconds it was three-on-one, we were really scared, and we survived it and we have to go on," said the coach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't want to go home yet, we will fight until the very end against Turkey so we can get into the knock-out rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech goalscorer Schick limped off with an apparent calf problem in the second half and Hasek said further tests were needed, although he was not positive the Bayer Leverkusen striker would be ready for the final group match on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-seeded German Alexander Zverev fell in straight sets to Pole Hubert Hurkacz in the semi-final of the Halle grass-court tournament on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hurkacz won through 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in one-hour, 33-minute and will next play either world number one Jannik Sinner or China's Zhang Zhizhen for the title in the pre-Wimbledon warm-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth-seeded Pole, winner in Halle two years ago, will bid to win his second title of the season after on clay at Estoril in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really confident on my serve," said Hurkacz who fired 17 aces including 13 in the first set and saved all four break points he faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It needed to be really good," said Hurkacz after his first win over Zverev in four meetings, most recently a three-set defeat in the United Cup final, a mixed team event before the Australian Open in Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That match that was a little bit sitting in the back in my mind," said Hurkacz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was like, okay, not today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is such a good competitor and is playing good tennis, reaching the final at the French (Open) and playing at a really high level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Hurkacz will aim to clinch his ninth ATP Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really love grass," said Hurkacz, the 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist. "The surface suits my game and the atmosphere here, having the full crowd is incredible." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Austria claimed a convincing 3-1 win over Poland in Berlin on Friday to take a step towards the Euro 2024 knock-out rounds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Robert Lewandowski returned from a thigh injury as a substitute for Poland, now on the brink of elimination from Group D after two defeats, but could not help his team make inroads against Ralf Rangnick's sturdy side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland striker Krzysztof Piatek levelled Gernot Trauner's opener, but Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic's second-half goals earned Austria three vital points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria dominated the opening stages and Trauner powered home a header at the near post from the enterprising Phillipp Mwene's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piatek levelled for Poland after half an hour, staying calm in the box when a rebound fell his way and slotting into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the game level approaching the hour mark, Poland coach Michal Probierz sent on Lewandowski, who took the captain's armband.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Showing little concern about his injury, the forward charged around and quickly picked up a booking for catching Philipp Lienhart with his arm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria regained the lead after 67 minutes when Arnautovic cleverly stepped over a pass received by Baumgartner, who stroked into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Baumgartner celebrated wildly with Rangnick and gave the former interim Manchester United coach credit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He supports me every day and gave me a lot of strength at half-time," explained the midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He talked to me for three or four minutes, so the thanks went to him too."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran captain Arnautovic, 35, sealed the win with a late penalty after Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny felled Marcel Sabitzer. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia remain underdogs in Euro 2024 and are determined to make a good run in the tournament, coach Francesco Calzona said on Friday, hailing a crop of players who performed well even in defeat against a determined Ukraine side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovakia started the Group E match strongly with a succession of chances leading to Ivan Schranz netting his second goal of the championship in the 17th minute, but a resolute Ukraine fought back to level the score after the break and stunned the Slovakians with another 10 minutes from time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia came into the match with 10 wins from the last 14 games, including their shock 1-0 victory over Belgium on Monday, and needed just one more to advance early to the next round of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had the opportunity but we knew that we were coming up against a team that had to win at all costs to stay in the hunt to make it through to the knockout stage," Italian Calzona said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us we are the Cinderella story of the group stage so the fact that we're already here and competing to make it through to the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team try and play football against anyone regardless of the opposition and I'm very proud of that fact," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defeat for Slovakia will be a reminder of their last Euros, when their opening victory was followed by two defeats, including a 5-0 drubbing by Spain, and an early exit from the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calzona said the loss to Ukraine was all about the strength of a team that was desperate to make amends for their 3-0 trouncing by Romania, Slovakia's next opponents. Romania play Belgium on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we led this evening there was still a long way to go. We played very strong opposition, we know that. I am happy with my team's performance, we produced a great display, I'm very proud of my lads," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A few months ago it would have been inconceivable that our team could play against these strong sides." (Reuters)
