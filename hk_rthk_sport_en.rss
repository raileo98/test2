<div class="itemFullText">
 Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly agreed terms to become the new coach of the United States national team, according to multiple reports on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Athletic and ESPN reported that unnamed sources confirmed Pochettino, who parted ways with English Premier League side Chelsea in May, would replace Gregg Berhalter as boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino, 52, would arrive as the United States prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino left Chelsea after finishing sixth in the Premier League in his only season in charge, after previous stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports said the deal was struck after multiple conversations with US Soccer Federation technical director Matt Crocker, and that no contract has been signed nor has the federation's board of directors agreed a deal with Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentinian cannot sign a contract with US Soccer until a pay situation with Chelsea is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino would be expected to take over the US squad in time for a friendly against Canada on September 7 at Kansas City. (AFP)

    Gauff crashes out in WTA Cincinnati opener

 Second-ranked defending champion Coco Gauff crashed out in her opening match at the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Open, falling to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The second-round shock to America's Paris Olympic flag-bearer stunned a partisan crowd in the US heartland in the final major tuneup for the US Open on August 26, where Gauff is defending champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva, ranked 34th, has made a recent habit of upsets, knocking off world number one Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon third round barely a month ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really proud of myself," said Putintseva. "Even if the crowd was cheering for Coco, they were fair with me. "These courts are so fast, you have to just play on instinct. That's what I did."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff became the youngest winner at Cincinnati a year ago at age 19 and carried that success into her first Grand Slam triumph at the US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva will next face Spain's Paula Badosa, who defeated Anna Kalinsyaka 6-3, 6-2. (AFP)

 Rookie road rider Puck Pieterse clung on to win stage four of the Tour de France Femmes in Liege on Wednesday, with compatriot Demi Vollering taking second in a photo finish to conserve the yellow jersey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the first-ever road race victory for the 22-year-old cross-discipline star Pieterse at her first Tour de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result lifted the Dutch rider to second overall, and gave her the best young rider's white jersey and the polka dot climb jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To take the win here, in a sprint ahead of Demi, it's really a dream coming true," said Pieterse. "They were riding for the general classification. I'm just here for the stage. I'm fresh. I just tried to keep a poker face and take it from the sprint."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering, meanwhile, held onto the leader's yellow jersey she pulled on after Tuesday's time-trial in Rotterdam. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé enjoyed a "great night" as he struck on his Real Madrid debut to help his new side claim a record sixth Uefa Super Cup with a 2-0 win over Atalanta on Wednesday in Warsaw.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The superstar French forward has waited years to play for his dream club and after finally signing for Los Blancos this summer at the end of his Paris Saint-Germain deal, celebrated his first appearance with a goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fede Valverde broke the deadlock from close range for the Champions League holders in the 59th minute after the Italian Europa League winners held their own in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid began to rack up the chances and Mbappé rifled home in the 68th minute after Jude Bellingham spotted his dart into space in the box to seal the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great night, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, to play with this shirt, with this badge, for these fans," Mbappé said, speaking in fluent Spanish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's triumph ensured coach Carlo Ancelotti equalled former Los Blancos coach Miguel Munoz on a joint-record 14 titles won at the helm of the club.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of the SAR's Olympians have mixed views over the remuneration local athletes receive, with some saying a better package would certainly help, while others said Hongkongers already receive good support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Entry level full-time athletes can get around HK$7,000 a month in sponsorship from the Sports Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing a recent call from badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu, fencer Cedric Ho said more support would certainly help, noting that plenty of athletes have to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As someone who had been there myself, back in the day I would need to save money sometimes," he said on Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I did was I was extremely thrifty, I don't go out for a meal and force myself to eat whatever at the institute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, sailor Nicholas Halliday said Hong Kong athletes already do quite well compared to some overseas counterparts, calling the pay packages "reasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the airport, after competing at the Paris Olympics, another sailor, Russell Aylsworth, agreed, saying they "owe it all" to the institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the Hong Kong Sports Institute has given Nic and I and my sailing partner Akira Sakai tremendous support, they've been very, very helpful. Without them, I wouldn't be able to call myself an Olympian for sure," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just want to thank everyone in Hong Kong for supporting and watching the both of us sail, I just want to inspire the youth, and for all the other sailors coming up, just to continue to train hard and push hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Halliday and Ho said they plan to qualify for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for now, Halliday said he's looking forward to having some down time and enjoying some Hong Kong food favourites like cheung fun.

 Defending champion Demi Vollering won Tuesday's 6.3km time trial through the streets of Rotterdam to take over the lead after three stages of the women's Tour de France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fellow Dutchwoman Charlotte Kool made it two wins from two stages on home soil in the morning, before Vollering clocked the fastest time in the second part of a Tuesday double-header to grab the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering powered around the course in 7min 25sec to finish ahead of Olympic time-trial bronze medallist Chloe Dygert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very surprised that I managed to win this time trial. Even with a difference of five seconds. I have no idea how that's possible," said Vollering.

 Kylian Mbappé appears ready to make his debut for Real Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup against Atalanta on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the France striker arrived in good shape following the European Championship and was adapting well to the team after a week of practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé “could play tomorrow,” Ancelotti said Tuesday at a news conference at the National Stadium in Warsaw where the match will be played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé is the biggest draw in the Polish capital after finally joining Madrid following a drawn-out saga with his former club, Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was introduced to the club’s fans at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium last month,  but wasn’t part of the squad on its U.S. tour while he rested after Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He joins a slew of world-class forwards at Madrid, including Vinícius Júnior, another new signing in Brazil striker Endrick, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo and Arda Guler. (AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn hamstring and will miss the Test series against Sri Lanka, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Tuesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former England batsman Graham Thorpe died after being struck by a train at a railway station, an inquest into his death heard on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 55-year-old took his own life, his wife Amanda revealed on Monday in an interview with The Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe died on the morning of August 4 having suffered "traumatic injuries" during the incident at Esher railway station, southwest of London, Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area coroner for Surrey, Simon Wickens, recorded Thorpe's cause of death as one of multiple injuries during the short hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner offered his "sincere condolences" not just to Thorpe's family, but to "all those touched by his life and career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A date for the full inquest will be fixed at a later time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's death plunged the cricket world into mourning for the popular star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoyed an impressive England career as an elegant batsman from 1993 to 2005, before spending 12 years in various coaching roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Thorpe was hospitalised in May 2022 and declared "seriously ill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe told The Times that the former Surrey batsman attempted suicide two years ago before taking his own life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite having a wife and two daughters whom he loved and who loved him, he did not get better. He was so unwell in recent times and he really did believe that we would be better off without him and we are devastated that he acted on that and took his own life," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe added: "Graham was renowned as someone who was very mentally strong on the field and he was in good physical health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But mental illness is a real disease and can affect anyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's daughter Kitty, 22, said the family "are not ashamed" of talking about his death, adding: "There is nothing to hide and it is not a stigma."

 Dutch rider Charlotte Kool kept her head amid a chaotic bunched sprint finish to win the first stage of the women's Tour de France on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It was really hectic but I like it. I kept on thinking 'I like hectic, I like chaos'," said the 25-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I went so early and I thought it's too long and it hurt so bad but it was enough in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kool, born in North Holland, took the yellow jersey on home soil as the women's Tour got underway in the Netherlands with a 123-kilometre flat ride from Rotterdam to The Hague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Topping 60kmh as she crossed the line, the Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL rider claimed her maiden Tour win with an unstoppable surge in the last 100 metres to complete the stage in a time of two hours 47 minutes and 40 seconds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Atletico Madrid signed striker Julian Alvarez from Manchester City on Monday in a deal reported to be worth up to 85 million euros (US$93 million).
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The club has reached an agreement with Manchester City for the transfer of the Argentine forward, who has signed a contract for the next six seasons," said Atletico in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish reports say Atletico will pay 75 million euros for the forward, with potentially 10 million more in bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old arrived at City for just £14 million (16 million euros) in January 2022 from River Plate, winning two Premier League trophies and the Champions League among other silverware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez also helped Argentina lift the World Cup trophy in December 2022 and the Copa America in 2021 and 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I say goodbye to this amazing club, with a lot of emotion," Alvarez told City's club website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These have been two very special years. During this time, I have grown and learnt a lot – both as a player and as a person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez scored 36 goals for City in 103 appearances across all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's incredibly loved by the team for his behaviour but like I said many times for many players, he wants to leave and have a new challenge," said Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diego Simeone's Atletico have also signed Robin Le Normand and Alexander Sorloth as they reinforce heavily to compete with Real Madrid and Barcelona, following a disappointing fourth-place La Liga finish last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Atletico begin the new campaign with a visit to face Villarreal on August 19. (AFP)

    Ex-Olympic diving champion Tom Daley retires
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tom Daley, (right), who won silver in Paris with Noah Williams, says he now wants to spend time with his husband and two children. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765919_1_20240812232925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Olympic gold medallist Tom Daley said on Monday it was the "right time" to retire as Britain's most successful diver walked away from the sport following the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Daley, who won five Olympic medals during his decorated career, revealed the decision to call time on the sport during an interview with British Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old bowed out after winning silver in the Olympic men's synchronised 10m platform in France, having clinched the gold medal in the same event at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to make the decision at some point, and it feels like the right time. It's the right time to call it a day," Daley said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley emerged as the star of British diving after first competing at the Olympics in the 2008 Beijing Games aged just 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London in the 10m platform, as well as bronze in the men's synchronised 10m platform in Rio 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley had effectively retired after his gold medal success in Tokyo, before deciding to return for a fifth Olympics in Paris in order to compete in front of his two children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He decided ahead of the event that he would stop diving competitively once he stepped out of the pool in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels very, very surreal. I felt so incredibly nervous going into this, knowing it was my last Olympics," he told Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was a lot of pressure and expectations. I was eager for it to be done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But when I walked out, and saw my husband (Lance) and kids (Robbie and Phoenix) and my friends and family in the audience, I was like, you know what? This is exactly why I did this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was emotional at the end, up there on the platform, knowing it was going to be my last competitive dive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley's gold in Tokyo came alongside Matty Lee and he was back to defend his title in Paris after being convinced by his six-year-old son Robbie to return to the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley and partner Noah Williams claimed silver in the competition, finishing behind China a fortnight ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking forward to spending more time with his family away from the Olympic spotlight, Daley has no fears he will regret retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to be with my family. I'm really excited to be able to spend some time with them and just be able to feel a bit normal for a couple of days," said Daley, who fulfilled a childhood dream by becoming the first diver to be a British flag bearer in the Olympic opening ceremony in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's always hard when you say goodbye to your sport. Lots of things to process, but I think it's the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year felt like such a bonus and I got to compete in front of my family, my kids. I got to be a flag bearer. So yeah, bucket list ticked off on every occasion." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Just opposite the fencing stadium, the Grand Palais on the Avenue des Champs Élysées, scores of tourists have been queuing up outside the largest Olympic merchandise store to take home a taste of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paris 2024 megastore offers a variety of souvenirs, from 5 euro pens and bracelets, to giant mascots costing 800 euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekday visitors have had to wait around 15 minutes to get inside the store, but most RTHK spoke to said it was worth queuing up for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adam, a UK tourist in Paris with his kids, bought a T-shirt, a hat, a poster and some badges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We spent about 110 euros, which I think, as it's only every four years, it's something to remember the Games by, so I think it's okay every once in a while,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic mascot “Phryge”, a little red hat symbolising French liberty, is one of the bestsellers at the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas from Hong Kong bought one because he wanted something special to take home with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s unique and it's like representing the culture and France and also it represents the spirit of the Olympics, so we're trying to look for something very unique for a gift,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to the French capital can also take home the smell of a fresh baguette, with the launch of scratch-and-sniff stamps by the French postal service La Poste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's to celebrate the baguette, which is one of the symbols of France for the tourists for them to enjoy and to share this with the people they live with abroad,” said Gaspard, a worker at the Olympic Village’s post office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French baguette was given Unesco heritage status in 2022.

 Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell on Sunday became the first LIV Golf player to be suspended under its anti-doping policy for using an over-the-counter decongestant that contained a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2010 US Open champion used a decongestant at LIV's June event in Nashville that contained the banned substance levo-methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDowell posted on social media that he was struggling with severe congestion that affected his sleep prior to the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saudi-funded league said McDowell would be suspended for one tournament and fined US$125,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will be replaced in the field at the LIV Golf Greenbrier next week by an alternate. (AFP/AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes was helped off the field after suffering an injury while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred domestic cricket competition on Sunday, raising concerns he could miss the upcoming test series against Sri Lanka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old Stokes pulled up while running between the wickets as the Superchargers chased a victory target of 153 against Manchester Originals at Old Trafford. Stokes appeared to clutch his left hamstring as he was completing a quick single from the non-striker’s end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes, who had bowled 15 overs in the match, retired hurt on two runs with England teammate Harry Brook coming out to replace him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes led England to a 3-0 series sweep against West Indies last month. England opens its test series against Sri Lanka next Wednesday at Old Trafford, with the third and final test at the Oval from September 6. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris said a triumphant "au revoir" to the Olympics on Sunday as the curtain came down on its widely praised staging of the global sporting spectacular.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A star-studded closing ceremony took place in front of around 71,500 spectators at the Stade de France to crown an event that has been broadly acclaimed as one of the greatest editions of the Olympics ever held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 270 artists performed in the packed arena for an estimated 9,000 athletes who marched into the venue as the festivities got into full swing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening segment of the ceremony festivities began with France's swimming hero Leon Marchand -- winner of four gold medals at these Games -- gathering the Olympic flame from the cauldron in the centre of Paris to begin its journey to the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rugby hero Antoine Dupont -- who led the host nation to a rugby sevens gold medal in one of the early highlights of the Games -- carried a tricolore flag into the Stade de France as partying athletes swarmed the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show included a theatrical sequence entitled "Records", which was a dream-like immersive journey through time, led by a "Golden Voyager".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musicians Phoenix then entertained the crowd with a series of hits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach hailed the Paris Games as "sensational".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish - or dare I say, Seine-sational Games," Bach said in a speech at the closing ceremony, in a reference to the river which staged the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the Los Angeles Olympics, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed to the Californian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then it was time for Hollywood's top gun Tom Cruise to jump from the roof of the Stade de France into the closing ceremony before speeding off with the Olympic flag in a dramatic handover that began the anticipation for the Games in 2028.

  <br/>
  Living up to the stunning success of the Paris Games may seem like mission impossible for LA and the celebrity-rich city will lean on its stars such as leading man Cruise as the Olympic spotlight turns to Southern California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise was among the many celebrities seen taking in the action at the Paris Games, showing up at gymnastics, swimming and soccer.

  Finally, Yseult, a French R&B singer, performed "Comme d’habitude," the song famously adapted into "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A dazzling festival of sport in Paris officially ended on Day 16 as the 2024 Olympics concluded with a spectacular closing ceremony. The baton has been passed to Los Angeles, which hosts the Games in 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US edged out France in the last event of the day in women's basketball to claim their 40th gold medal in Paris. China also won a 40th gold in women's weightlifting, but the Americans end the Games ahead of the national team due to the fact they won 44 silvers compared with China's 27. Japan finished third while hosts France were fifth. Still, China's 40 golds is its second highest ever after the Beijing Olympics of 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong China's Ceci Lee was bidding for a medal in the women's omnium, but it wasn't to be. The SAR finished 37th in the table with two gold and two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here are some of the highlights on the last day of the Olympic Games in Paris.

       The United States held off France 67-66 to win an unprecedented eighth successive women's Olympic basketball gold on Sunday and extend their run of victories at the tournament to 61 games.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A'ja Wilson scored a game-high 21 points for the Americans who won the title for the 10th time overall, surviving a buzzer-beating shot from France's Gabby Williams.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The hosts needed a three to force overtime but Williams' foot was on three-point line as she let go off the ball, so her shot counted for just two points in a dramatic finale.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu will be awarded the Olympic floor exercise bronze medal, after it was taken away from her following an appeal from the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Olympic Committee made the announcement on Sunday, one day after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the request by the American team to re-evaluate Jordan Chiles' score was lodged four seconds after the one-minute deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review, which went ahead at the time, upgraded Chiles to bronze from fifth, behind Brazil's winner Rebeca Andrade and fellow US gymnast Simone Biles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was a devastating blow for Barbosu, who thought she had bagged bronze and was already celebrating with the Romanian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can barely express my emotions, I can't believe it," Barbosu said after learning she was awarded her country's only gymnastics medal in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I heard the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A devastated Chiles took to Instagram, posting four broken hearts, adding: "I am taking this time and removing myself from social media for my mental health thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who trains with Chiles, and won team gold with her in Paris, added: "Sending you so much love Jordan. Keep your chin up Olympic champ! We love you!" (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday congratulated the SAR's athletes for their achievements at the Paris Olympics, noting it was the first time that Team Hong Kong, China had won more than one gold medal at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Golds from foil fencer Edgar Cheung and épée fencer Vivian Kong, as well as two swimming bronzes from Siobhan Haughey, put the SAR 37th in the medals table, which is the city's highest ever ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Hong Kong athlete has given their utmost and unleashed their full potential in the Olympic arena. In spite of the results, all athletes have fully exhibited their determination, perseverance and will, demonstrating their professional attitude and sportsmanship," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people of Hong Kong and I are deeply inspired and moved. The people of Hong Kong are proud of the high level of performance shown by Hong Kong athletes, and each and every one of them is a hero in our hearts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the government would provide more sporting facilities, such as converting an existing sports centre into a dedicated fencing venue, and speeding up a study on building a fencing arena and a swimming pool which can host international competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the current financial year, the administration had provided more than HK$940 million in funding to the Sports Institute through the Elite Athletes Development Fund, around a 40 percent increase from five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said with the Paris Paralympic Games later this month and Hong Kong co-hosting the National Games next year, he's confident that society would continue to support the SAR's athletes to shine and "demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Hong Kong".

<div class="itemFullText">
 For the second consecutive day, the United States silenced the home crowd in Paris as their women's basketball team narrowly edged their French counterparts, 67-66, in a gripping gold medal match to notch an eighth straight Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both teams struggled to find the basket in an unusually low-scoring first half, which ended 25-all. France shot 28 percent from the field, compared to 29 percent for Team USA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts then brought the crowd on their feet, after starting the second half on a 10-0 run to go 35-25 up for their biggest lead of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that advantage did not last, as the Americans finally broke out of a funk and scored 16 of the next 21 points to go back on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides exchanged leads in the fourth quarter, but the Americans held on to their slim edge to win by the finest of margins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Down by three with 3.8 seconds left, France could have sent the game into overtime with a three. But Gabby Williams stepped inside the three-point line as she hoisted - and made - a two-point shot as time expired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia earlier beat Belgium 85-81 in the bronze medal match, returning to the podium for the first time since London 2012.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jennifer Valente of the United States on Sunday retained her Olympic title in the women’s omnium at the Paris Games while the SAR's Ceci Lee finished 20th.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That concluded Hong Kong, China's participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente ended with 144 points in the multi-race event, consisting of the scratch, tempo, elimination and points races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland’s Daria Pikulik took silver while Ally Wollaston of New Zealand rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first scratch race, cyclists were ranked and awarded points by the order they finished the 30-lap event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente was off to a strong start and finished first, earning the maximum 40 points, with Canada’s Maggie Coles-Lyster and Georgia Baker of Australia coming from behind to grab second and third respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, making her Olympic debut, came 19th among the 22 riders to earn four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist moved up to 18th overall after the second tempo race, where the top contestant per lap was awarded a point from the fifth lap forward while 20 points were given for lapping an opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland’s Lara Gillespie came out on top in this race but Valente maintained her overall lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old SAR athlete earned 16 points by finishing 13th, giving her 20 points at the end of the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the elimination round, the last cyclist of every other lap was knocked out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente won this round as well to continue to top the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, was the fifth athlete eliminated and ended up with six points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final points race, points were awarded to the top four athletes for every 10 laps in the gruelling 80-lap race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist finished near the bottom of the pack in the race that was won by Poland’s Pikulik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, a tearful Lee described her performance as "very poor", saying she felt she let many people down, including her coaches, teammates and the former top SAR cyclist Sarah Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like in the past, I did very poorly in the scratch race, and I couldn't change that today," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though Sarah Lee very diligently tried to pass on her experience to me before the race, I still did very poorly. Coaches and teammates spent a lot of time training with me for the omnium, but I still raced very poorly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had said she hoped to finish in the top 10 overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee, who won silver at the Asian Games last year, added that her Paris experience allowed her to get a taste of just how good the world's finest cyclists are. She also said she hopes to work hard in future to improve her fitness and use of tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's cycling team head coach, Herve Dagorne, said while he could understand her frustrations, he felt she could have been more aggressive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the ominum, and the last event is the points race. You need to score points, so if you don't try, you don't get it, it will not come from the sky," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can understand it's disappointing... I wish she could have attacked more in the points race, like the Japanese did and the French did. They gained a lap, [scoring] 20 points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation earned a total of four medals in Paris: golds for fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung, and two bronzes from swimming star Siobhan Haughey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee and taekwondo athlete Lo Wai-fung will be the flagbearers for the SAR at the closing ceremony.

 Weightlifter Li Wenwen on Sunday won China's 40th gold at the Paris Olympics, finishing first in the women’s +81kg category.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li lifted a combined 309kg at the South Paris Arena, 10kg more than South Korea’s Park Hye-jeong in second place and 21kg more than American Emily Campbell, who took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese weightlifter checked off with 136kg in the snatch, 5kg more than Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li then raised 173kg overhead with relative ease in the clean and jerk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having already won the race, she ditched the third lift and instead picked up her coach to celebrate on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, a two-time world champion, topped the podium in Tokyo three years ago in the women’s +87kg class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old holds the world and Olympic records for the women’s highest weightlifting category.

 Weightlifting champion Li Fabin and women's hockey team captain Ou Zixia will be the flagbearers for China in the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, 31, is a Tokyo Olympic champion who successfully defended his title in the men's 61kg weightlifting category at the Paris Games on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He performed consistently in the snatch, ultimately lifting 143kg to secure first place and set a new Olympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also holds the Olympic records for the clean and jerk and total weight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being chosen as a flagbearer is something I never even dared to imagine. I am incredibly excited and proud. This is a high recognition of the Chinese weightlifting team and the glory earned through the hard work of generations of weightlifters. I am extremely honoured to carry this responsibility," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ou led the women's hockey team to the Olympic final on Friday, where they lost to the Netherlands 3-1 in the penalty shootout.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands won Olympic women's marathon gold in Paris on Sunday in a thrilling sprint finish.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hassan traded elbows with Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia with 150 metres left, then passed her along the railing to win the race for her third distance medal of the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hassan finished in an Olympic record time of 2 hours, 22 minutes, 55 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also won bronze in the 5,000m and 10,000m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assefa finished 3 seconds behind Hassan to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya’s Hellen Obiri took the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopian-born Hassan lingered behind the leaders for the bulk of the race before summoning up the energy for a late-race kick that will go down as one of the best the sport has seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been impossible to call with all the favourites among a leading pack up until the last 10km.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three runners from China took part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang Deshun finished 59th in a time of 2:36.47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xia Yuyu was 72nd and Bai Li 76th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking from tradition, the women’s Olympic marathon was held on the final day instead of the men’s race. (Agencies)

    HKers putting rope skipping on the map in Paris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The rope skipping team is among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform in Paris. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765737_2_20240811161208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Olympic delegation isn’t the only team representing the SAR in Paris – the city’s rope skipping performance squad is also in the French capital to push for their sport to be included in future editions of the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rope skipping troupe is amping up the atmosphere at the Paris Games by performing at the Place de la Concorde, which has become the heart of urban sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time in history, various urban disciplines, such as 3x3 basketball, street and park skateboarding, BMX freestyle and breaking, have been grouped together at one site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though these sports have increasingly been adopted in the past two Games, there are those, like rope skipping, that still have not made their way to the Olympic stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's what the Hong Kong Rope Skipping Association, China, is hoping to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform at the open stage of Parc Urbain to promote urban culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tina Wong, the association's chairperson, said performing in Paris is an opportunity they could not pass up, even though the Games conflicted with the jump rope Asian Championships in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are here on the Olympic platform. We actually have the goal or you could say dream to have jump rope skipping to be included in the Olympics in 2032 in Australia because Australia is one the strongest countries in this sport. This is a more long-term goal. On a short-term basis, we are aiming for Asia,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually last year, the Olympic Council of Asia has already granted rope skipping the provisional membership, so meaning we are already included in Asia. This year, we are here. Next year, we are aiming to go to the Youth Asian Games and pave the way for the Asian Games and then the Olympics. We hope with more support, we can officially be on the Olympic stage soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four athletes from the SAR have made their way to Paris to perform, including 18-year-old Yuen Hiu-tung, who said that the atmosphere was unbelievable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s like a dream to come here because even though we paid to come here, it’s a very valuable experience for us because we don’t know when jump rope can get into [the] Olympics, so it is a good experience to promote jump rope, and also letting everyone know how is jump rope [works] and how everyone is enjoying this sport,” she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The honorary secretary general of Hong Kong's top sports body, Edgar Yang, on Sunday said the city should nurture all athletes with potential, rather than solely focusing on one or two elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to a TV programme, the senior member of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China said the SAR has huge potential for sports development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the system must be very sound, and this sound method starts from popularising and definitely not focusing on just one or two athletes - but rather on the overall system that can bring out potential. We must put in a great effort. Even for those who have not yet fully realised their potential, we must enable them to be inspired," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Paris Olympics nears its end, Yang said Hong Kong athletes are now world class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR athletes have secured two gold medals in fencing and two bronze medals in swimming.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There were 39 events up for contention on Day 15 in Paris, the second last day of these Olympics, and China went on a gold rush, completing a clean sweep of all the golds on offer in diving, table tennis and artistic swimming. The national team also celebrated Olympic wins in weightlifting, rhythmic gymnastics and boxing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That single day haul of six gold medals means China leads the table with 39 golds, ahead of the United States which has 38. Australia maintain third place in the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look back at what unfolded.

   China completed an historic clean sweep of all eight Olympic diving gold medals after Cao Yuan won the men's 10m platform final on Day 15 in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cao became the first to retain his Olympic 10m crown since American Greg Louganis in Seoul 1988.

    <br/>
    Like the divers, the national table tennis squad also made history by completing a clean sweep of all golds on offer at the Paris Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    China completed the feat after winning the women's team title, the sixth time the Chinese have collected the full set.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Chinese women withstood a brave Japanese challenge but eventually overpowered their opponents 3-0 to snatch gold, the fifth Olympic title out of five events.

     Not to be outdone by the divers and table tennis stars, China's artistic swimmers also completed a golden sweep. After winning the team event, the Chinese twin sibling pair of Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi dazzled in the pool to win gold ahead of Britain who took silver and the Netherlands the bronze.

      <br/>
      <br/>
      Liu totalled 406kg, 7kg short of his own world record, for his two lifts in the recently-created weight class.

       Israel took silver, while Italy bagged bronze at the Port de La Chapelle Arena.

         There was also redemption for Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the 5,000m, after failing to medal in the 1,500m, while New Zealander Hamish Kerr won a jump-off for high jump gold and Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi won the women's javelin.

           The US continued their golden run in team sports as the men's basketball team did as expected by grinding out a 98-87 win over hosts France to claim a fifth consecutive gold medal.

           With the French sporting spotlight locked on the Bercy arena, the American showmen crushed Gallic hearts led by a fired up LeBron James, the "King" wearing shiny golden sneakers to mark the occasion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China clinched a third boxing gold at the Paris Olympics, as Li Qian was crowned women's middleweight champion after winning the bout against Panama's Atheyna Bylon on a 4-1 split decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, who took silver in Tokyo, was adjudged as the better performer in two of the three rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old top seed has now collected Olympic medals of all colours, having also won bronze in Rio de Janeiro eight years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said after the bout that by winning gold, she had made amends for the "regret" in Tokyo, and a fitting response to both herself and the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's boxers have won three golds and two silvers in Paris, with all of them coming in women's events.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The star-studded US men's basketball team successfully clinched their fifth straight Olympic gold -- beating France 98-87 in a hotly-contested final at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephen Curry hit eight three pointers to lead the Americans with 24 points. Four of his triples came in the final three minutes of the game to silence a raucous home crowd at Bercy Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of the Tokyo Olympics final three years ago, French center Victor Wembanyama finished with 26 points and seven rebounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts were able to keep the game close for much of the first three quarters, trailing 66-72 entering the final frame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Wembanyama tip-in cut the deficit to three with less than three minutes to go, but Curry then took control with his hot-shooting to put the US back up by nine with less than a minute remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After scoring his final basket, Curry, the four-time NBA champion, did his trademark “go to sleep” gesture where he puts his hands on the side of his face to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the 36-year-old sharp-shooter's first Olympic gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Durant and Devin Booker scored 15 points apiece for the Americans, while LeBron James chipped in 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite a losing effort, French forward Guerschon Yabusele continued his strong play at the Games, finishing with 20 points.
  <br/>

    Amateur runners revel on streets of Paris in mass run

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Amateur runners jump at the chance to run the actual Olympic marathon route, passing through landmarks such as the Louvre.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Running enthusiasts say they are thrilled to have a chance to follow the footsteps of their Olympic heroes in the heart of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For the first time, some 20,000 amateurs were able to run on the same route as marathon athletes on the penultimate day of the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The “Marathon For All” sets off at the French capital’s city hall and finishes at Esplanade des Invalides via Versaille, passing through landmarks such as the Louvre Museum and the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy came all the way from Hong Kong for a once in a lifetime experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because it's the Olympic Games. I think in a lifetime you cannot join. It shows that everyone can try to run on the same road, no matter if you are an elite runner or you are just a normal [person]," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another participant, Michele from the United States, hoped she won't get too distracted by the city's night scenery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most difficult part is...I'm in Paris. This is my first time here. And I love it. And so I'm very distracted with everything else that's going on. So it's really hard for me to kind of just settle in, enjoy the moment, and just be here for the marathon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elizabeth, a hill runner from London, didn’t want to miss the opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just thought it was mad not to sign up. Honestly it's incredible. I was watching the men’s race, and I'm sort of joking that I'm going to come home an Olympian."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km route pays tribute to a key event of the French Revolution - the women’s march on Versailles in 1789.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's B-Boy Phil Wizard won the inaugural Olympic men's breakdancing gold in Paris on Saturday, beating home favourite Dany Dann of France in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard, whose real name is Philip Kim, triumphed amid the opulent grandeur of the Place de la Concorde, with B-Boy Victor of the United States taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also known as breaking, the street dance is making its first and possibly last appearance at the Games, having been left off the programme for Los Angeles 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's competition saw 16 dancers - or B-Boys - going head-to-head in a series of battles, starting with a round robin before moving to a knock-out stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard, a 27-year-old former world champion, had the crowd against him in the final against Dany Dann, a 36-year-old with blue hair whose real name is Danis Civil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Canadian soon had them eating out of his hand thanks to his incredible routine, for which the nine judges awarded him a 3-0 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Wizard explained the panel of judges were looking for "something new every round".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You may well think it's the most explosive, crazy dynamic movements that score the most points," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in breaking there's a lot of different categories and the most important thing is originality and diversity of movement."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States' men's 4x400m team set a new Olympic record en route to winning gold medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rai Benjamin, who won the 400m hurdles gold, anchored the US quartet to victory, which also featured Christopher Bailey, Vernon Norwood and Bryce Deadmon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed the relay in 2 minutes and 54.43 seconds for an exciting finish at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Botswana, with 200m champion Letsile Tebogo on their fourth leg, took silver in an African record of 2 minutes, 54.53 seconds, while Britain claimed bronze in a European record of 2 minutes, 55.83 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's 4x400m gold also went to the Americans, as Shamier Little, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Gabrielle Thomas and Alexis Homes won in three minutes, 15.27 seconds, just a tenth of a second short of the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands took silver in 3 minutes 19.50 seconds, and Britain edged Ireland for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on, American sprinter Masai Russell won the women's 100m hurdles gold in another stunning photo finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She finished the race in 12.33 seconds, a hundredth of a second ahead of France's Cyrena Samba-Mayela, who got her country's first track medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Olympic champion, Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico, got bronze in 12.36 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Emmanuel Wanyonyi ran the third-fastest time in history to win men's 800m, clocking a personal best one minute and 41.19 seconds, just barely ahead of Canada's world champion Marco Arop, who got silver. Algeria's Djamel Sedjati had the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand's Hamish Kerr became the first athlete from his country to win a high jump medal, taking gold after winning a jump-off with American Shelby McEwen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both men had cleared 2.36m, and decided they didn't want to share the top spot on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze went to Mutaz Barshim from Qatar, a joint-gold medallist at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In women's javelin, Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi sealed the gold medal with her opening throw, a season best effort of 65.80m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Faith Kipyegon broke her own Olympic record to win gold in women's 1,500m, finishing the race in 3 minutes 51.29 seconds, more than two seconds faster than her previous mark. She also became the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic 1,500m golds with another superb display of middle distance running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen middle distance star won gold in men's 5,000m, finishing the race in 13 minutes and 13.66 seconds. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For the third time on Saturday, China secured a clean sweep of gold medals in a sport after Wang Qianyi and Wang Liuyi clinched the duet in artistic swimming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old twin siblings from Shenzhen performed last out of 17 nations at the Aquatics Centre, after finishing first in the technical routine on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They came back only fourth in the free routine, but the combined score of 566.4783 points was still enough to be crowned champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain's Kate Shortman and Isabelle Thorpe won silver at nearly eight points adrift, while the Dutch twins of Bregje and Noortje de Brouwer rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result marked a perfect ending for China, who already struck gold in the team event on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national artistic swimming team were runners-up in both events in the past two Games, losing to Russia on all four occasions. But the defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the country's conflict with Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the Wang sisters will return to school next month, having already been admitted to the Education University of Hong Kong's Doctor of Education (Chinese prospective) programme.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City avenged their FA Cup final defeat to Manchester United to lift the Community Shield 7-6 on penalties on Saturday, after a 1-1 draw at Wembley.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The game exploded into life in the final 10 minutes as Alejandro Garnacho gave United the lead before Bernardo Silva levelled in the 89th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's men then edged a marathon shoot-out as Jadon Sancho and Jonny Evans failed to score for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City have won the Premier League for a record four consecutive seasons but it is the first time in that run that they have won the season opener after defeats to Leicester, Liverpool and Arsenal in the past three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The English champions were severely hampered by the absence of a series of key players due to their late return to pre-season after competing at Euro 2024 and the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City's England trio of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Phil Foden, as well as Spain midfielder Rodri are yet to return to training following their efforts in reaching the final of Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, United boss Erik ten Hag showed his desperation to win more silverware by thrusting teenager Kobbie Mainoo straight back into the heart of the action after his starring role for England in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite also leaving Kevin De Bruyne and Silva on the bench, City controlled the game early on with the electric Jeremy Doku causing havoc down the left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James McAtee could be handed his chance to shine this season by Pep Guardiola with Julian Alvarez set to join Atletico Madrid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And McAtee, who spent last season on loan at Sheffield United, was inches away from making his mark with a curling effort that came back off the post midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's job is widely believed to have been saved by beating City back in May and he will feel his side should have got the better of their rivals once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United were being starved of possession but still managed to create the better of the chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo should have gone for goal himself rather than trying to square to Bruno Fernandes with the goal gaping as half-time approached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandes started in an unfamiliar centre-forward role due to the absence of Rasmus Hojlund through injury and a lack of match fitness for Joshua Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United captain thought he had opened the scoring with a stunning strike on the hour mark that was ruled out for offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho was introduced for the final half-hour and brought more pace and invention to the United attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentine teed up Marcus Rashford, who could only hit the post with just Ederson to beat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho thought he had won the game on 82 minutes as he jinked inside the City defence and fired low into the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, City rallied and levelled in the final minute of the 90 when Oscar Bobb's cross was headed in by Silva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Portuguese midfielder was then the first to miss in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Andre Onana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, though, experienced more penalty woe at Wembley after missing in the final of Euro 2020 for England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His spot-kick was brilliantly saved by Ederson, who then fired in himself to keep City alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evans gave City the chance to win it when he blazed over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it was a tale of redemption for Manuel Akanji, whose saved penalty cost Switzerland in their Euros quarter-final against England, as the centre-back stroked home the winner. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US women's football team won its fifth Olympic gold medal by beating Brazil 1-0 on Mallory Swanson’s early second-half goal in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Americans, who hadn't won gold since the 2012 London Olympics, closed out an undefeated run to the title in their first international campaign under new coach Emma Hayes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher preserved the win with a one-handed save on Adriana’s header in stoppage time at Parc des Princes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss is more heartbreak for Brazil and its iconic star, Marta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The six-time world player of the year has never won a Women’s World Cup or an Olympics. This is expected to be her last major international tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the third victory for the United States over Brazil in an Olympic final. The Americans also beat the Brazilians in the 2004 in Athens and four years later in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil has never finished better than runner up at the Olympics.
  <br/>

  Three years ago in Tokyo, the US settled for the bronze medal. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's team completed the country's clean-sweep of table tennis gold medals at the Paris Olympics, after defeating Japan 3-0 in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Yingsha, Chen Meng and Wang Manyu outclassed a fighting Japanese team of Hina Hayata, Miwa Harimoto and Miu Hirano for China's fifth gold in the sport, after the nation had earlier won both the men's and women's singles, the men's team as well as mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first match of the women's team final, Chen and Wang teamed up in the doubles against Hayata and Harimoto. The Chinese pair came back from two one-game deficits to force a deciding fifth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan raced to a 9-5 lead in the pivotal game, before Chen and Wang went on a 7-1 spurt to win 12-10 and take the first match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hirano then took on Sun in the second match, as she raced to a 7-1 start to open the matchup. However, the world number one Chinese player came roaring back to win the first game 13-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun then took the next two games, 11-6, 11-6, for a 2-0 lead overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall, Japan's Harimoto put up a fight in the third match by taking the first game against Wang, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese player stormed back to win the next three games, 12-10, 11-7, 11-6 to bring home the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the game, all three Chinese players said Japan proved to be difficult opponents, noting the Japanese were able to lead twice in the opening doubles match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said for her, it was important to come from behind and take the first singles game, adding it was a total team effort for the country to take home all Olympic table tennis golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy for us to take home all five gold medals. I very much thank our motherland, our team, there are many supportive forces behind us," she told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually today, it wasn't just the three of us competing, the whole Chinese table tennis team were behind us, giving us support."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the introduction of the women's team category in 2008, China has won all five of the event's gold medals.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's Cao Yuan (centre) edged out Japan's Rikuto Tamai (left) and Great Britain's Noah Williams to snatch the eighth and final diving gold medal on offer in Paris.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China completed an historic clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Paris Olympics, after Cao Yuan retained his 10m platform title to make it eight wins out of eight for the powerhouse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As much as the nation has dominated the sport in recent years, it has never taken home every gold medal at a single Games. It came close twice in Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, with seven wins
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the once-elusive achievement did not come easy. Cao was locked in a tight battle against Japan's Rikuto Tamai, with the pair separated by less than three points after four rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that all changed in the penultimate round, when Tamai committed a serious error on his routine and dropped out of contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao finished with 547.50 points after six rounds, compared to 507.65 for the Japanese, which was good for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noah Williams of Great Britain propelled himself to a bronze with a sensational final dive worth 94.35 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Yang Hao, the reigning world champion who beat his compatriot Cao at the World Aquatics Championships in Doha in February, not only was a surprise omission from the podium, but finished last out of the 12 finalists.

File photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765668_1_20240810223516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles 2028 organisers said on Saturday they will force spectators to take public transportation to Olympic venues and encourage remote working in a bid to sidestep the gridlocked city's notorious traffic problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said 2028 chiefs want the LA Olympics to be "The No Car Games" by investing in public transportation and encouraging Angelenos to adopt pandemic-style remote-working for the duration of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'No Car Games' means that you will have to take public transportation to get to all of the venues," Bass told a press conference ahead of Sunday's Paris Olympics closing ceremony. "In order to do that we have been building out our transportation system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan would require borrowing more than 3,000 buses from other parts of the United States, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass was adamant however that Los Angeles's traffic, where rush hour congestion can lead to car journeys of just a few miles taking an hour or more, would not be a problem, citing the history of the 1984 Olympics in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 1984 Angelenos were terrified that we were going to have terrible, terrible traffic," she said. "And we were shocked that we didn't. And in 1984 we didn't have any of the technology that we do today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that city officials 40 years ago encouraged employers to stagger shifts or allowed workers to work remotely to great success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we can do that again," Bass said. "So part of having a no-car Olympics means getting people not to drive, but also using public transportation to get to the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We certainly learned from Covid that you have essential workers, people that must come to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if you limit it to that, it's going to be a lot easier because we did go through Covid. So people will have some reference point in recent history as to how you can do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass said the city would also aim to house Los Angeles's estimated 75,500 homeless population before the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if Los Angeles would follow Paris' example by moving several thousand homeless people in the build-up to the Olympics to locations outside the city, Bass replied: "We are going to get Angelenos housed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is what we have been doing and we're going to continue to do that. We will get people housed, we will get them off the street." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's rhythmic gymnasts won the group all-around final at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with Israel taking silver and Italy completing the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Each team of five gymnasts had to produce their best performances with five hoops, as well as three ribbons and two balls. The scores were then added up to create a final total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the scoreboard with 36.950 points in the first routine with hoops and a medley of five musical compositions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team continued their strong performance with ribbons and balls to score 32.850, to a total of 69.800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China took home gold by a 0.950-point gap to beat Israel, who came in second with a cumulative of 68.850 points. Italy scored 68.100 to claim bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bulgaria, who won gold at the Tokyo Games, narrowly missed out on a medal despite an impressive comeback from an initial mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team received the highest score in the second routine, recovering from an error in the first performance where two hoops clashed in the air.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese weightlifter Liu Huanhua on Saturday won the men's 120-kilogramme division in his debut at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He got to 186 kilogrammes in the snatch at the South Paris Arena, and lifted 220 kilogrammes in his first clean and jerk attempt before failing the next two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old completed four out of six lifts but it was enough for him to finish with a total score of 406, beating Uzbekistan's Akbar Djuraev by two kilos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djuraev also failed the final two attempts in the clean and jerk. Yauheni Tsikhantsou took home the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu previously set world records in both the clean and jerk at 232 kilogrammes, as well as the total of 413 kilogrammes in his weight class during the IWF World Cup in Phuket this year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ethiopia's Tamirat Tola runs from Versailles to Paris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765648_1_20240810182818.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopian Tamirat Tola delivered a masterclass in solo front running to win the Olympic men's marathon in Paris on Saturday as Eliud Kipchoge's bid for a third gold went up in smoke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tola clocked an Olympic record of two hours  six minutes and 26 seconds for victory, finishing 21 seconds ahead of Belgium's Bashir Abdi, whose silver marked an upgrade from his bronze garnered at the Covid-hit Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Benson Kipruto, winner of Tokyo, Boston and Chicago marathons in recent years, rounded out the podium, a further 13 seconds adrift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you, Paris!" said Tola, the 2016 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist who will be 33 on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy today, I was 2022 world champion and now I'm Olympic champion. It's the greatest day in my life. This was my goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team fielded three long-distance runners in the event, with Wu Xiangdong finishing 40th with a time of two hours, 12 minutes and 34 seconds. Yang Shaohui came in 55th with a time of two hours, 14 minutes and 48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s third runner, He Jie, needed two hours 22 minutes and 31 seconds to finish the race, finishing 67th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km-long marathon course headed out of central Paris on a loop to Versailles.
  <br/>
  The route included a 436m climb and 438m descent. The maximum gradient on the route was 13.5 percent. (Additional reporting by AFP)

 The road to the Olympics is not easy for athletes, but it’s just as hard for judges who likely spend the same amount of time and effort in training to be able to officiate Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For gymnastics judge Yuen Ka-keung, the journey to Paris was lonely and arduous, but one that he hopes will pave the way for others to follow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Being an Olympic gymnastics judge is not easy because you have to pass many of the selection [tests] under the International Federation, so you had to prepare a lot, meaning that you had to spend a lot of the time and also you had to manage everything well,” Yuen, who is judging the Olympics for the third time in Paris, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to allocate my time and also allocate, for example, money to make the proper preparation for this Olympic Games. Another thing is that if you prepare for the Olympic Games very seriously, you will feel alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen is the only gymnastics judge from the SAR. To qualify, he had to judge designated events within the Olympics cycle and obtain the best evaluation result in two competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The veteran gymnast said he hopes the government will put more resources into training athletes, and those behind the scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gymnastics is not only [about the] coach and gymnast. We should have many more supporting people, for example the judge, the physiotherapist, the psychologist and other people,” Yuen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Wong, one of the two cycling judges from Hong Kong appointed by the International Federation, echoed Yuen’s views.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Hong Kong, we can organise different kinds or different levels of judge development or training courses and encourage the people to have the qualification to enter the international training courses," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like me, when I prepared for the international commissaire course, I paid [for it] myself,  [so I could] visit different kinds of large-scale events."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, who played a leading role on the judging team for cycling at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said he feels proud to be a part of the world's biggest sporting event for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that safety is paramount on the racetrack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We stand on the track to monitor the behaviour of the riders and also the behaviour of different TV broadcast staff members. Because we need to protect all the people on the track,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In case any accident happens, the riders will go out of the track with the bike and at that moment [there will be] a serious accident if we don't manage it in a proper way.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that he hopes newcomers can have more exposure to large-scale cycling events in Asia before they become judges.

 Day 14 in Paris saw China mine gold in diving, sprint canoeing, table tennis and boxing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gold rush sees China in second place in the medals table with 33 golds, behind the United States which also has 33 golds, but is in first place due to a higher overall medal count.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look at some of the key moments.

   After three Olympics without any gold medals in women's boxing, China won their second in as many days when Wu Yu beat Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu in the flyweight final on Day 14.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Wu's compatriot Yang Liu could not get past Algeria's Imane Khelif who claimed the gold medal in the women's welterweight boxing category at the Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khelif had been in the spotlight at the Paris Games amid a gender dispute that dominated headlines.

    Chen Yiwen added the women's 3m springboard gold to her synchronised title in the French capital, winning the seventh gold for the Chinese diving team at the Paris Olympics.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Chen's teammate Chang Yani finished third while Australian diver Maddison Keeney won the silver medal.

     China successfully defended their Olympic men's team title after beating Sweden in three nail-biting matches as Ma Long cemented his status as one of his country's most accomplished athletes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ma, already the most successful Olympic table tennis player, became the most decorated Olympian in China's history with six gold medals.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Although the national team overcame Sweden 3-0, each match was a five-game thriller as the seventh-seeded Swedes pushed them all the way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both Sweden and France celebrated their first ever medals in the table tennis team event, also marking the first time two European nations have stood on the podium.

       China came very close to winning an historic gold medal in women's field hockey, but in the end came up short against the Netherlands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Netherlands completed a remarkable double in Olympic hockey when their women's team, the defending champions, beat China 3-1 in a shootout to take gold just 24 hours after the men's side had triumphed over Germany.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Dutch women, who were appearing in their sixth successive final, were made to work hard for their fifth Olympic gold medal after China held them to a 1-1 draw in regulation time.

        Sha'Carri Richardson powered the US to an Olympic sprint relay gold with a storming anchor leg.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Richardson turned on the afterburners to overhaul Britain, Germany and France in the home straight as the US quartet took gold.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But on a wet track at the Stade de France, the US men again failed in their bid to win their first 4x100m gold since Sydney in 2000 with a disastrous baton fumble.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Already missing 100m individual champion Noah Lyles through Covid, a botched baton change completely slowed the US momentum, allowing Canada to snatch gold ahead of South Africa and Britain.

         Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time as Spain took gold in the Olympic men’s soccer final after a 5-3 win against France on Friday.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The thrilling win at Parc des Princes completed a golden summer for Spanish soccer — following the senior team's European Championship triumph last month.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         France came back from 3-1 down to send the game to extra time when Jean-Phillipe Mateta equalised from the penalty spot in the third minute of time added on.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         But substitute Camello coolly lifted over France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes in the 100th and got his second in the first minute of time added on.

          <br/>
          There are already suggestions the sport might be excluded from the Los Angeles Games in 2028.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The urban sport of breaking spun its way onto the Olympic stage on Friday for the first and possibly last time, with Japan's B-Girl Ami winning the inaugural women's gold.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Breaking, better known as breakdancing, made its debut amid the grand elegance of Paris' Place de la Concorde, with 17 dancers known as B-Girls going head-to-head in a series of battles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ami, whose name is Ami Yuasa, beat Lithuania's Dominika "Nicka" Banevic in the final, with China's Liu "671" Qingyi taking bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport's appearance at the Olympics could be a fleeting one however, having already been dropped from the Los Angeles 2028 programme and no guarantees it will return in the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was disappointing it was decided that it wouldn't be in LA, particularly before we even had a chance to show it," said Australian B-Girl Rachel "Raygun" Gunn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that was possibly a little premature. I wonder if they're kicking themselves now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers ensured breaking made the most of its time in the spotlight in Paris, pumping up the volume for an excited crowd that included rapper Snoop Dogg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each battle sees B-Girls take turns to lay down their dance moves over a set number of rounds, with a panel of judges determining the winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The competition opened with a pool stage featuring four groups of four B-Girls, before moving onto the knockout round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first contest of the day was between India Sardjoe of the Netherlands, known by her B-Girl name India, and Refugee Olympic Team competitor Talash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Talash, whose real name is Manizha Talash, left Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to live in Spain two years ago and danced wearing a blue cape with "Free Afghan Women" printed on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's competition takes place on Saturday. (AFP)

 US sprint star Sha'Carri Richardson struck gold with a relay rescue act as Belgium's Nafissatou Thiam sealed her place in the pantheon of Olympic greats with a third consecutive heptathlon title on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Another spellbinding night of athletics action at the Stade de France saw the United States add to their gold medal tally thanks to a stunning last leg from sprint star Richardson in the women's 4x100m relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US's highly fancied men's relay quartet however finished empty-handed after a disastrous performance saw them disqualified, with Canada storming to a memorable victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's 10,000m, Kenya's Beatrice Chebet completed a long distance double with her second gold medal of the games, four days after triumphing in the 5,000m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a masterful performance from the diminutive East African known as the "smiling assassin", who timed her finish to perfection to scamper home in 30minutes 43.25 seconds, ahead of Italy's Nadia Battocletti (silver) and Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's shot put saw Germany's Yemisi Ogunleye snatch a dramatic gold medal with her final attempt, a last-ditch heave of 20.00m taking her past New Zealand's Maddison-Lee Wesche, who threw 19.86m. China's Song Jiayuan won bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's triple jump, Spain's Jordan Diaz won gold with a jump of 17.86m, with Portugal's Pedro Pichardo taking silver and Andy Diaz of Italy claiming bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were golds too for the Dominican Republic's Mari Marileidy Paulino in the women's 400m, while the men's 400m hurdles saw the United States add to their gold tally with Rai Benjamin outfoxing Norway's Karsten Warholm to claim gold. (AFP)

 Controversial boxer Imane Khelif is officially queen of the ring, winning an Olympic gold medal amid a gender row which has cast a shadow over her Paris campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Algerian defeated China's Yang Liu by unanimous decision in the women's 66kg gold medal bout, with all three rounds going in her favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang, the reigning Asian Games champion, was unable to repel Khelif's fast and powerful punches, often retreating while failing to land good hits on her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was written on the wall even before the umpire made the announcement, with Khelif already holding one arm in the air looking ready to celebrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was consolation for China earlier on Friday night, after Wu Yu clinched gold in the women's 50kg by taking a 4-1 split decision over Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There was heartbreak for China's women's hockey team after they were beaten in the final by the Netherlands in a shootout, despite leading the defending champions most of the way.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was China's second silver medal in the sport, equalling their best-ever finish in Beijing in 2008 when they were also defeated by the Dutch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China nearly pulled off a remarkable upset after Chen Yi put the underdogs ahead just six minutes into the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands then laid siege in front of the Chinese goal, but couldn't find the equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finally broke down the stubborn defence nine minutes from time, when Yibbi Jansen found just enough space to fire home from a penalty corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides were unable to score again in regulation, and the match had to be decided by a shootout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anne Veenendaal put on a goalkeeping clinic, making three saves to deny China, and helping the Dutch claim their fifth women's crown in six Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Sergio Camello struck twice in extra time to settle a remarkable Olympic men's football final on Friday as Spain beat France 5-3 to take gold after the hosts had earlier staged a dramatic comeback.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It had looked as though Spain were going to run away with victory at the Parc des Princes in Paris when they recovered from conceding an early goal to lead 3-1 by half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enzo Millot put France in front, but a Fermin Lopez brace and an Alex Baena free-kick turned the final completely on its head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, France staged a memorable comeback with Maghnes Akliouche pulling a goal back before Jean-Philippe Mateta converted a stoppage-time penalty awarded following a VAR review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That took the final into extra time, where Rayo Vallecano forward Camello emerged as the hero by giving Spain the lead again in the 100th minute of an absorbing game, and then running away to seal their victory at the death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Silver medallists in Tokyo three years ago, it is the second time Spain have won Olympic men's football gold after their victory in Barcelona in 1992 with a squad featuring Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France had hoped for a second gold of their own, 40 years after winning in Los Angeles, but instead have to settle for silver. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s men’s table tennis team of Ma Long, Wang Chuqin and Fan Zhendong on Friday took gold at the Paris Olympics, beating the seventh seeded Swedish team 3-0.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This is the fifth straight gold medal for the men's team at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three matches between the teams went the distance and went on for more than two and a half hours at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the opening doubles match, Ma and Wang dropped the opening game against Swedish duo Anton Kallberg and Kristian Karlsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the national team came back strong and won the next two games 11-4 and 11-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They lost the fourth game to Sweden 6-11 and took the final game 11-7 to win the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan, who struck gold in the men’s singles in Paris, took on Sweden’s Truls Moregard in the second match. It went back and forth before Fan pulled through for a 3-2 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one paddler Wang started strong in the third match and won the first two games 11-9 and 11-5, before losing the next two to Sweden’s Karlsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang beat Karlsson 11-2 in the fifth and decisive game, sealing gold for China.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s Chen Yiwen triumphed in the women's 3m springboard final on Friday at the Paris Olympics, putting the national team one gold medal away from achieving all eight diving crowns at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chen, who is a first-time Olympian, performed five stellar dives leading the scoreboard throughout all five rounds. She earned a total of 376.00 to top the podium – over 30 points ahead of the silver medallist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old attempted a forward 3 ½ somersaults pike in the fourth round, making this her best dive and earning her a 77.50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Chen’s second gold at these Games, where she also won the women’s synchronised 3m springboard with teammate Chang Yani.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia’s Maddison Keeney came in second, maintaining the silver spot throughout the competition with a score of 343.10. Her last forward 2 ½ somersaults 2 twists pike dive earned her a 78.20, the highest score received in the entire competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chang wasn’t able to replicate the success she had in the synchronised diving having had a rough start finishing at the end of the pack in round one, but she was able to catch up by the fourth round to secure the bronze with a 318.75.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men’s 10m platform final – the last diving event of the Games – begins on Saturday at 9pm Hong Kong time, where China is looking to complete a clean sweep of golds in all eight diving events.

 The Chinese pair of Xu Shixiao and Sun Mengya powered to victory in the women's canoe double 500 metre final at the Paris Games on Friday, setting a new Olympic record of 1:52.81 and breaking the mark of 1:53.73 that they set earlier in the day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Liudmyla Luzan and Anastasiia Rybachok came in second to take silver, with Canada's Sloan Mackenzie and Katie Vincent finishing third to claim bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a tailwind providing some of the choppiest waters seen at the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, Xu and Sun got off to an excellent start but the Canadians kept the pressure on them before fading over the final stretch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the national team's second canoe sprint medal at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's freestyle wrestler Zou Wanhao was not able to make a comeback in the men’s 57 kilogramme category at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old lost by a final score of 7-4 to Kyrgyzstan's Bekzat Almaz Uulu in the repechage, bringing his debut Olympic run to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uulu will next face Gulomjon Abdullaev of Uzbekistan in the bronze medal bout. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR is sending 23 athletes to Paris for the upcoming Paralympic Games, with prize rewards nearly doubled to reward Paralympians.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The athletes representing Hong Kong, China, are set to compete in eight sports. The squad includes wheelchair fencer Alison Yu, who will be competing at the Paralympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu, who has won seven Paralympic gold medals, three silvers and one bronze, said it is important to get into the right mindset in the last weeks leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so looking forward to competing at the Grand Palais... In the Olympic Games, we saw Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong get gold medals at the Grand Palais, so I think the Grand Palais is a lucky place for us," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to relax a bit from fencing, not thinking so much about fencing and trying to be ready mentally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For rider Natasha Tse, she said it is an honour to compete for the SAR in her fourth Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My challenges in this Games are on how to get used to my new horse, or how to get used to the weather, or even the accuracy in my test," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Paralympian Leung Chung-yan, who will compete in the men's table tennis singles, said he is excited to play and hopes to win a match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officiating at the flag ceremony ahead of the Games, Chief Executive John Lee pointed to higher rewards for Paralympians, with a gold medal winning solo athlete set to receive HK$1.5 million. He also said the entire city is behind the SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of you have overcome various challenges to reach the pinnacle of sport, competing with athletes from all over the world on the Paralympic stage. We are proud of you," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Your participation not only represents your personal efforts and achievements but also represent Hong Kong's support and recognition of parasports."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Paralympics will run from August 28 to September 8.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic fans can now travel back in time to catch a glimpse of what the Paris Games were like a century ago, thanks to new AI-powered cloud tech that can bring historic moments back to life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alibaba Cloud, a partner of the International Olympic Committee, is supporting the Games through cloud computing and e-commerce platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris Tung, president of Alibaba Group’s strategic development, said the tech giant is using generative AI to restore videos and colourise moments from when the French capital last hosted the Olympics in 1924.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “By doing that, we'll be able to represent the glorious moments of Olympic Games in the past and be able to come up with concepts and stories to spread Olympic spirit and culture,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tung said that cloud infrastructure has overtaken satellites as the primary source of television broadcasts for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It has been more than 50 years that we watched exciting Olympic games on TV through satellite,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For Paris 2024, this will be the first time that cloud-based broadcasting exceeds the volume of satellite-based [broadcasts]. So it's a great building block from game to game, from flame to flame that we're doing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba Cloud has also built a data management platform for all Olympic venues, which they use to monitor and analyse energy consumption and carbon emission data, in line with the organisers’ goal of making the Paris Games the greenest ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding privacy concerns, Tung said all visitors’ personal data will be removed after 24 hours, while audio clips and videos will only be kept for less than a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, mainland EV maker Xpeng has decided to make its debut on the French market in Paris to make the most of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now you are with the Olympics, this is the most beautiful city in the world. That was the perfect platform to launch such a premium brand,” said Thomas Rodier, head of marketing and communication at Xpeng France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very invested in leading EV technology, but also autonomous driving technologies where we are [a] leader in China, and soon, I hope in Europe," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodier also said provisional EU duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese EV imports will not affect Xpeng's business in France.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States kept the dream alive with a stirring fourth quarter rally to tame feisty Serbia 95-91 and move into the Paris Olympics men's basketball gold medal final against France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trailing by double digits for much of the game and down 76-63 heading into the fourth quarter, the United States chances of a fifth consecutive gold were quickly dimming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then NBA stars LeBron James and Stephen Curry took charge, bringing a wide-eyed capacity crowd at the Bercy Arena to their feet with a furious fight back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Curry made nine three-pointers on his way to lead all scorers with 36 points, while James finished with a triple double of 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A turning point of the game came with more than seven minutes left in the final period, when Serbia's star center Nikola Jokic committed a foul on Anthony Davis when American forward Kevin Durant made a three pointer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foul meant the US maintained possession of the ball, and Devin Booker hit another triple on the ensuing possession to cut the deficit to five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Curry made a three pointer for an 87-86 lead with around two minutes to go for the Americans' first lead since the first quarter, as they hung on for the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US win delivered the final basketball fans wanted to see and is sure to be one of the Paris Olympics highlights, as the Americans take on an inspired France on Saturday, in what will be a hostile Bercy cauldron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolstered by an electric home crowd, a turbo-charged France won a 73-69 thriller over Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France was led by a 17-point effort from Guerschon Yabusele while Isaia Cordinier chipped in 16, none more important than two free throws with seven seconds to play to blunt a Germany fight back and seal victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the national team, this jersey brings to us that different energy that we can't find nowhere else," said Victor Wembanyama, the first Frenchman to be taken number one overall in the NBA draft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can see how intense we've been over the last two games. It's something that we all feel as patriots. We love our jersey. We love our country." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese boxer Chang Yuan dominated from the opening bell to land gold in the women's 54kg final at the Paris Olympics on Friday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old from Hebei province landed a series of blows on her opponent, Turkey's Hatice Akbas, to win a unanimous points victory from the judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang was ahead on four of the five cards after the first round, when Akbas showed occasional signs of danger, but took full control for the latter two three-minute sections, scoring ahead on every card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In truth, Chang had been tested more heavily in earlier rounds, including in a split decision victory over the North Korean, Pang Cholmi, in the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the national team's 29th gold of the Games and the first in boxing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Chinese fighter, Li Qian, made it to the women's 75kg final thanks to a victory by unanimous decision over Caitlin Parker of Australia in Friday's semi-final.

 Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem won the Olympic men's javelin title in Paris on Thursday, his country's first individual gold at a Summer Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadeem threw an Olympic record of 92.97 metres for victory, India's defending champion Neeraj Chopra taking silver with 89.45. Grenada's Anderson Peters claimed bronze with 88.54m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Arshad's remarkable victory, Pakistan had never won an individual gold medal at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of Pakistan's previous three gold medals came in hockey, with their team winning gold in 1960, 1968 and 1984.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to Thursday, only two Pakistan athletes had won individual medals of any colour – with a wrestling bronze in 1960 and a boxing bronze in 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the 1992 Barcelona Games, Pakistan has not won a medal of any kind. (AFP)

 France's Benjamin Thomas recovered from a late crash to win gold in a pulsating Olympic men's omnium race and send the home fans wild inside the National Velodrome on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former world champion Thomas won the scratch race, the first of the four events that make up the omnium, and scored heavily in the elimination race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As is usual with the multi-event omnium, the final points race would decide the gold and Thomas was involved in a fierce tussle with Portugal's world champion Iuri Leitao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just as Thomas got to the top of the leaderboard he lost control of his bike and slid down the track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He calmly checked himself over though and re-joined the race with holes in his skin suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the crowd roaring him on he managed to stay on the wheel of Leitao, who made a late dash for gold, and could begin celebrating as he rounded the last corner knowing he had an unassailable lead in the points standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium's Fabio van den Bossche completed the podium with bronze, just ahead of Spain's fast-finishing Albert Torres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leitao became the first Portuguese to win an Olympic medal in track cycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, New Zealand's Ellesse Andrews surged to gold in the Olympic track cycling women's keirin. The 24-year-old hit the front early, held off Britain's Emma Finucane around the final bend and powered across the line.

  Finucane, who won gold in the team sprint, faded in the final metres and was overtaken by Dutch rider Hetty van de Wouw who took the silver with Finucane settling for bronze. (Reuters)
