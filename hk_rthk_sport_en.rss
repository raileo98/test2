<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz started poorly and fell behind early in his French Open semi-final against Jannik Sinner. Later, as both dealt with cramps under Friday's afternoon sun, Alcaraz trailed by two sets to one.
 <br>
  <br/>
  By the end of the latest instalment in this burgeoning rivalry between two young, talented players, an engaging five-setter that lasted 4 hours, 9 minutes, Alcaraz actually had accumulated fewer total points, 147-145.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That, of course, is not the score that matters. And Alcaraz, who says he takes pleasure from challenges, ultimately persevered, pulling out a 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Sinner to get to his first final in Paris. It made the 21-year-old from Spain the youngest man to reach a Grand Slam title match on three surfaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to find the joy (while) suffering. That’s the key – even more on clay, here at Roland Garros. Long rallies. Four-hour matches. Five sets,” Alcaraz said. “You have to fight. You have to suffer. But as I told my team many, many times, you have to enjoy suffering.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won championships at the US Open in 2022 on hard courts and at Wimbledon in 2023 on grass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the No 3-seeded Alcaraz will face No 4 Alexander Zverev of Germany on the red clay on Sunday. Hours before his 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 semi-final victory over No 7 Casper Ruud of Norway, Zverev’s domestic abuse case in Berlin ended, because he reached an out-of-court settlement with his accuser, a former girlfriend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruud started well, but then began to fade, and he was handed some pills by a doctor during a third-set changeover. Ruud looked listless and stopped chasing some shots, a shell of the player who leads the tour in match wins this season and has been the runner-up at majors three times – including in 2022 and 2023 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev finally broke through at Roland Garros after bowing out in the semi-finals each of the past three years. This will be his second Grand Slam final: He blew a two-set lead and lost in five against Dominic Thiem at the US Open in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be the first French Open men’s final without Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer since 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic was the defending champion in Paris, but he withdrew before the quarter-finals after tearing the meniscus in his right knee and had surgery this week. Because he failed to get back to the final, he will drop from atop the ATP rankings, allowing Sinner to rise a spot from No 2, despite his defeat on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously disappointed how it ended, but it’s part of my growing and the process,” said Sinner, who won the Australian Open in January for his first major trophy. “The winner is happy, and then the loser tries to find a way to beat him the next time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old Italian showed up in Paris with a lingering hip injury that forced him to sit out the clay-court tournament in Rome last month. Alcaraz missed that event, too, because of a right forearm issue that he said made him afraid to hit his booming forehands at full force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both men experienced physical problems in the third set. Alcaraz's right hand began to cramp. Sinner had his right forearm and left thigh massaged by a trainer during changeovers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It brought to mind last year’s French Open semifinals, when Alcaraz got off to a terrific start against Djokovic but then dealt with full-body cramps that rendered the remainder of the match anti-climactic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I learned from last year’s match against Djokovic, when I was in the same position as today,” Alcaraz said. “I know that, in this moment, you have to be calm, you have to keep going, because the cramp is going to go away. You have to stay there, fighting.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and Sinner are seen as the future of men’s tennis. The present isn’t too shabby, either. Even though this was not necessarily the most aesthetically pleasing of their nine head-to-head meetings – Alcaraz leads 5-4 – and they combined for 102 unforced errors, there were moments of brilliance that generated duelling clap-accompanied chants of each man’s first name from the Court Philippe Chatrier crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fifth set, with shadows covering more than half the court, Alcaraz moved out front by sliding until he could reach across his body to snap a backhand passing winner for a break point. A forehand winner – one of his 30 in the match – made it 2-0 at the 3½-hour mark, earning a yell of “Vamos!” from his coach, 2003 French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon, it was 3-0, and Alcaraz was on his way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was a great match. For sure, the sets he won, he played better in the important points,” Sinner said. “That was the key.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both players walloped the ball with such force that the ball-off-strings thuds elicited gasps from spectators in the middle of points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner, his rust-colored shirt a few shades darker than the clay, came out ready at the start of the match, barely ever missing, gliding more than grinding along the baseline, stretching his long limbs to get to nearly everything Alcaraz offered. Alcaraz, his right arm covered by a white sleeve, would deliver a powerful shot to a corner, punctuated with a grunt, and Sinner would somehow get to it, flip it back and draw a mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner led 4-0 and it took Alcaraz 20 minutes of striving to simply place a “1” beside his name on the scoreboard. The second set began inauspiciously for Alcaraz, who fell behind 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I told myself,” Alcaraz said, “that it’s going to be a long match.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not go quietly. Getting more aggressive and doing what he could to shorten points, Alcaraz turned things around right when he needed to, using a five-game run to take control of that set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Sinner took the third, Alcaraz pushed the proceedings to a fifth. He closed the fourth with a cross-court backhand winner, then raised his right fist and shook it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's how Alcaraz came through: He came up with a 32-23 edge in winners over the last two sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his strokes, somehow, gaining zest, and the fans, somehow, getting louder, Alcaraz advanced at a tournament he grew up watching on TV at home in Spain as his countryman Nadal piled up a record 14 titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not that it was easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s one of the toughest matches that I’ve played, for sure,” Alcaraz said. “The toughest matches that I played in my short career have been against Jannik.” (AP)

    China women's hockey team hopeful for an Olympic medal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's hockey team has set their sights on a podium spot at this year's Olympics, even though they have a tough road ahead to clinch a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations have been underway for the Paris Games, with the team recently spending almost two months in the Australian city of Perth for a training programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhong Jiaqi, who's playing in her second Olympics, said the squad is more prepared this time than during the Tokyo Games in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we are more confident, and the whole team is in a very good condition,” Zhong said. “It could be because our result in the last Olympics was not satisfactory, so we want this year's Games to be good.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow teammate and defender Zheng Jiali, who is representing China for the first time at the Olympics, said the team is aiming for gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have strengthened techniques and strategies, as well as our fitness. There are overall changes and adjustments,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team achieved its best Olympic result on home soil during the 2008 Beijing Games, where they took silver. One of their coaches, Huang Yongsheng, said the team's success does not stop there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether it's 2008 or after 2008, the goal of the women's hockey team has never changed. We strive to do our best and always work to achieve the best results,” Huang said. “I feel like [the achievement in] 2008 is not our endpoint, it is just a starting point.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two years ago, Australia’s two-time Olympic gold medalist Alyson Annan took charge of the Chinese squad, and coach Huang said it has helped the team grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She brought some pioneering concepts from the West, merging them with what we already had in China, in the hope of better techniques and tactics that fit China more," Huang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team faces an uphill battle in Paris, having been placed in the same group as reigning Olympic champions the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other teams in the same group include Belgium, Germany, Japan and hosts France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team manager Guo Hong said he is certain the team will give their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Everyone has an Olympic dream. But I think we should be realistic and do things gradually,” Guo said.

    Porzingis' return fuels Boston Game-1 win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kristaps Porzingis returned from a 10-game absence to record 20 points off the bench and the Boston Celtics snuffed a second-half rally to beat the Dallas Mavericks 107-89 on Thursday night in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Porzingis hadn't played since Game 4 of Boston's first-round series against the Miami Heat due to a right calf strain. He seemed unfazed by the long layoff, though, shooting 8-for-13 from the field while collecting six rebounds and three blocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by as many as 29 late in the first half, Dallas got back into the game thanks to a third-quarter outburst headlined by Luka Doncic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star guard accounted for 10 points during the Mavericks' 22-9 surge to open the frame, with his 3-pointer cutting Dallas' deficit to 72-64 with 4:28 to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics responded emphatically, rattling off the next 14 points to take a 22-point lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Gafford closed the third with a pair of free throws to get Dallas within 20, but the Mavericks trailed by at least 17 for the entirety of the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game 2 is set for Sunday in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 22 points and added six boards, three steals and three blocks. Jayson Tatum chipped in 16 points and 11 rebounds, while Derrick White netted 15 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic recorded 30 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas, which got outshot 47.6 percent to 41.7 percent overall. P.J. Washington went for 14 points, Jaden Hardy scored 13, and Kyrie Irving, showered with boos all night, had 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Porzingis didn't draw the start, he wasted no time setting the tone after checking in with 7:17 left in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big man tortured his former team, scoring 11 points and blocking a pair of shots in the period to lift the Celtics to a 37-20 advantage after 12 minutes of action. No team has ever built a larger lead in the first quarter of Game 1 in Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston kept pouring it on, using a 14-2 run to go up 58-29 with 4:11 remaining in the second quarter. However, Doncic proceeded to erupt for nine points over the final four minutes of the first half, helping the Mavericks pull within 63-42 by the break. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States beat Pakistan in a Super Over in Dallas on Thursday to achieve one of the biggest upsets in Twenty20 World Cup history and secure their second win of the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pakistan, the 2009 champions, recovered from a poor start to score 159-7 but the U.S. plundered 14 runs from their final over to finish on 159-3 and send the match to a Super Over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tournament co-hosts made 18-1, helped by two wides from Pakistan, before restricting their opponents to 13-1 to seal a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a big achievement beating Pakistan and playing for the first time," U.S. captain and player of the match Monank Patel said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The way we played today I'm really proud of the boys and it was a complete team effort from ball one to the last ball."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan captain Babar Azam bemoaned his side's batting performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We didn't capitalise with the bat and they took a lot of momentum. We lost back-to-back wickets in the middle overs. As a batting unit you need to step up, you need to create partnerships and we didn't do that," Babar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Credit to USA, they performed so well today. They were better than us in all aspects of the game." (Reuters)

    Italy's Paolini to play Swiatek in French Open final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paolini celebrates her semi-final win over Mirra Andreeva. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756447_1_20240607080926.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jasmine Paolini will play Iga Swiatek in the French Open final after the Italian 12th seed ended the run of 17-year-old Russian sensation Mirra Andreeva in the last four on Thursday, winning 6-3, 6-1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paolini is through to her first Grand Slam final at the age of 28. She had never gone beyond the second round of a major before the start of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number 15 had won a total of four matches in 16 Grand Slam appearances before advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now she is one win away from an improbable title at Roland Garros as she tries to emulate compatriot Francesca Schiavone, who won the 2010 French Open. Paolini is also guaranteed to break into the top 10 for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I learned I think a little bit later than other players, to dream is the most important thing in sport and in life," said Paolini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy I could dream this moment. I don't know what to say, I'm so emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva had become the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist in 27 years with a shock victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her bid to be crowned the youngest major champion since Martina Hingis at the 1997 US Open was cut short as Andreeva was unable to reproduce the level that saw her put out an ailing Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini snatched the only break of a tight opening set in the fourth game, saving five break chances across her next two service games to keep Andreeva at arm's length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The errors continued to pile up for Andreeva and Paolini seized her opportunity once more when it arose at 1-1 in the second set, before breaking for a second time to stride towards the finish line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Andreeva looking increasingly disconsolate and fighting back tears, Paolini applied the coup de grace with one last break to complete a resounding victory. (AFP)

    Premier League clubs vote to continue using VAR

    <![CDATA[<img alt="According to the league, the number of correct decisions made in games has risen from 82 percent prior to its introduction to 96 percent last season. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756414_1_20240607002233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs voted on Thursday to continue using VAR next season after being asked to consider scrapping the technology.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the league's annual general meeting, the 20 teams decided against ending the use of video assistant referees for key onfield decisions, despite a series of controversies last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clubs, however, voted to make improvements “for the benefit of the game and supporters.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said it wants to reduce delays to games while decisions are being made, with the introduction of semi-automated offside technology key to that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The technology will provide quicker and consistent placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player tracking,” it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league also said it wanted to maintain a high threshold for VAR intervention and “more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In-stadium announcements will be introduced to improve fan experience, as well as big screen replays, where possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolverhampton Wanderers submitted a resolution to trigger a vote on the use of VAR last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said VAR “led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VAR has been used in the Premier League since the 2019-20 season. According to the league, the number of correct decisions made in games has risen from 82 percent prior to its introduction to 96 percent last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there have been high-profile errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most notable of those last season came in a game between Tottenham and Liverpool in September when a miscommunication meant Luis Diaz's goal was ruled out despite replays clearly showing the forward was onside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp later called for the game to be replayed after his team’s 2-1 loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said in April that semi-automated offside technology would be introduced in the autumn of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said it would continue to lobby the International Football Association Board, which oversees the laws of football, for greater flexibility to "allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.” (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's rugby sevens men's captain, Li Haitao, said the team is united and ready to give their best shot.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men's and women's national rugby sevens teams are preparing to contend for the final berth at the Olympics next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They will have to win the repechage tournament in Monaco at the end of the month for the trip to Paris and are among 12 entries battling for the last spots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's team are in the same pool with Canada, Great Britain and Uganda, while the women's squad face Poland, Czech Republic and Mexico in pool play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's assistant coach, Zhu Jing, said the most important thing is for the team to fight as one on the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said even though other countries are traditionally considered stronger in rugby sevens, Asians, like Chinese, also have their own advantages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of potential, actually Chinese people have quite an advantage. Because we have speed and agility. When we play we are actually better in these attributes compared to players from Europe or the Americas," Zhu told Hong Kong reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach said he's looking forward to seeing good performances from a couple of players. He said Shan Changshun and the captain, Li Haitao, have good physique and awareness on the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, for his part, said the team was focusing on improving their fitness ahead of the do-or-die tournament, as well as working on tactical adjustments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Making the Olympics for sure is every athlete's ultimate dream. We'll do our best yeah, do our best to get that ticket to Paris," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all in good shape, training with great enthusiasm. Also, in everyday life we're all very united as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the players were having extra sessions in the weight room, and the sports science team has helped their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he thinks the team's biggest foes are themselves, and all they need to do is to give it their best shot.

    Russian teen Andreeva stuns below-par Sabalenka

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mirra Andreeva fought back to defeat second seed Aryna Sabalenka at the French Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756273_1_20240606024121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's Mirra Andreeva became the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist since 1997 with a shock victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka, who was struggling with an apparent illness, at the French Open on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old fought back from a set down against her ailing opponent to win 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-4 after two hours and 29 minutes and set up a last-four meeting with Italy's Jasmine Paolini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva, aged 17 and 29 days, is the youngest woman to make the semis at a major event since Martina Hingis at the US Open 27 years ago and also the youngest at Roland Garros since Hingis in 1997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly I was really nervous before the match, I knew she'd have an advantage," said Andreeva, who had lost both her previous meetings with Sabalenka in straight sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I see the game, I play whenever I want, I don't really have a plan. When I see an open space on the court I try to play, I try to play behind her back or something like this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Me and my coach, we had a plan today but again I didn't remember anything. I just try to play as I feel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will fancy her chances of going all the way to the final when she faces Paolini -- who had never got past the second round at a Grand Slam before this year -- on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka called for multiple medical time-outs as she complained of not feeling well and Andreeva, playing in her maiden Slam quarter-final, eventually took advantage with a composed display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka had powered through the first four rounds but was clearly having difficulties, breathing heavily between points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva, currently ranked 38th, had already secured a breakthrough into the world's top 30 with her run to the last eight, but is now poised to rise further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tournament favourite Iga Swiatek plays US Open champion Coco Gauff in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka had been targeting a seventh straight Slam semi-final and had won 11 consecutive matches at the majors following her second Melbourne title earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was immediately clear that Sabalenka was not at her best, as she made four double-faults across her opening two service games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Andreeva suffered from nerves in key moments, failing to serve out the first set when leading 5-4, before Sabalenka rallied to take a tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It appeared as though Sabalenka would race away from her young rival -- the youngest woman to make the quarter-finals since 2005 -- when she broke in the first game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Andreeva hit straight back, with Sabalenka continuing to shake her head and crouch down between points in apparent pain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair traded breaks once more before Sabalenka again called for the trainer, saying she needed "something to make me feel better".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva was starting to get on top and levelled the match on her second set point as Sabalenka dumped a tired backhand into the bottom of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka was still grimacing and complaining towards her box early in the third set, but suddenly found her groove to break to love for a 3-2 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She could not back it up with a hold, though, as Andreeva quickly drew level and then moved 5-4 ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka failed to extend the contest behind her own serve as Andreeva sealed a famous victory in fine style, with a magnificent lob from way behind the baseline. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rising Chinese long jump star Zhang Mingkun said he is determined not to let the pressure get to him as he seeks qualification for the upcoming Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old said he is going to keep his mind at ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During a jump, your mind really goes blank. All you do is to enjoy it,” Zhang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The long jumper, who has a personal record of 8.13m, has been striving to reach the 8.27m entry standard for the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll find out in about a month's time on whether his dream would come true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the rest of the track and field team, the sprinters have been training with a new foreign coach ahead of the Games, and they see the benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Here, our training is relatively traditional... but it’s more scientific overseas,” said runner Wang Shuang from Jiangsu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Female sprinter Huang Ziting knows that the odds are against them, but reaching the Olympic stage remains the ultimate goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m certain every athlete would want to stand on the Olympic podium, but it feels like it would be more difficult for Asians [to achieve that],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another sprinter, Chen Jinfeng, said getting to Paris requires not only strong performances but a bit of luck as well.

    Translator admits stealing US$17mn from Ohtani

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese baseball great Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty on Tuesday to stealing nearly US$17 million from the athlete's bank account to pay off his own gambling debts, according to US prosecutors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ippei Mizuhara, the onetime translator and de facto manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers' power-hitting pitcher, pleaded guilty in a deal that had been announced last month, a US Attorney spokesperson said. Sentencing will be on October 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was previously filed in US District Court in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offence punishable by up to three years behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly US$17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former interpreter's lawyer declined to comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ohtani, 29, whose talents as a slugger and a pitcher have earned him comparisons to Babe Ruth, has said he was an unwitting victim of theft and has never bet on baseball or knowingly paid a bookmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to prosecutors, Mizuhara began gambling with an illegal sports book in late 2021 and lost substantial sums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cover his debts, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani over the phone on more than two dozen occasions to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. (Reuters)

    Injured Djokovic pulls out of French Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Novak Djokovic is saying goodbye to this year's French Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756102_1_20240604235342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic's disappointing season continued on Tuesday when the defending French Open champion was forced to pull out of the Grand Slam before his quarter-final due to a knee issue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The injury, sustained in his fourth-round win over Francisco Cerundolo, ended the Serb's quest for a record-extending 25th Grand Slam trophy and will result in him losing the world number one ranking to Jannik Sinner later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to a torn medial meniscus in his right knee (discovered during an MRI scan), Djokovic, who was supposed to play Casper Ruud in the quarter-finals tomorrow, has been forced to withdraw from the Roland Garros tournament," organisers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year's runner-up and seventh seed Ruud will now advance to the semi-finals, where he could face fourth seed Alexander Zverev or 11th seed Alex de Minaur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's marathon match was the second straight clash in which Djokovic was taken to five sets after his epic against Lorenzo Musetti and he has spent over nine hours on court in the last two rounds at the year's second major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb said he had been carrying an injury for a couple of weeks and that the problem had flared up when he slipped during his match against Cerundolo. The injury could also cast doubts over his fitness for next month's Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been a season to forget for Djokovic after his bid for a record-extending 11th Australian Open title was ended by eventual champion Sinner in the semi-finals, before he lost to lucky loser Luca Nardi early at Indian Wells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having been stunned by Ruud in the Monte Carlo semi-finals, Djokovic was thrashed 6-2 6-3 by Alejandro Tabilo in the third round in Rome last month, two days after being hit on the head by a fan's water bottle while signing autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic is still without a trophy this season after one of the most dominant seasons of his career in 2023 during which he claimed three of the four Grand Slam titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Sinner stepped up his bid for a second Grand Slam title by securing a 6-2 6-4 7-6(3) victory over Grigor Dimitrov, minutes after it was confirmed he would be the new world number one. A trickier test could await, however, as he faces a potential clash against fellow young gun Carlos Alcaraz who meets Stefanos Tsitsipas later. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of China's top gymnasts said they have different ways of dealing with the pressure that comes with intense training ahead of the Paris Olympics, as they shared with RTHK their journeys to reach the highest level of their sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xiao Ruoteng, who won silver in the individual all-around and bronze in the floor event at the Tokyo Olympics, said he has been battling injuries, including shoulder, wrist and ankle problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old stressed the importance of pushing himself to the limit, adding that he still sees himself as a young athlete hungry for success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no going back if we want to get to the top. We have to do what ordinary people can't do... Although this will be my second time at the Olympics and people might think I'm experienced... my mentality is that of a first-time Olympian. I'm excited about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xiao noted that the national team would focus on the team competition as a crucial opportunity to win the gold medal, which will then give them momentum in the subsequent individual events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan won gold on the parallel bars at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou acknowledged the pressure that comes with being in the spotlight, but said he got help from his teammates in handling that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are all under pressure. Athletes need confidence during competitions, regardless of the pressure. Other athletes are under pressure too and I try to learn from my teammates. If they can handle it well, what can I do to be like them?" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qiu Qiyuan, a promising 16-year-old specialising in the uneven bars, said support from her coach and family helped her overcome the pressure and injuries she has faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pressure is definitely there, but we have to turn that pressure into motivation because if we can't take that pressure, there's no way we're going to fight for Olympic gold," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had this injury two years ago and I had an operation. It's not a big problem. I'm recovering well. Now I have adjusted mentally. My coach and my family are helping and encouraging me."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic sparked concerns about his injured knee for the rest of his French Open title defence, with the top seed saying he briefly considered pulling out midway through his five-sets win over Argentine Francisco Cerundolo on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old had to dig deep for a second straight match after a third-round marathon against Lorenzo Musetti and needed medication during a 6-1, 5-7, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 win over Cerundolo that sent him to the quarter-finals after four hours and 39 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic said he had been experiencing slight discomfort in his right knee for a couple of weeks and the issue flared up as soon as he slipped and tweaked it during the third game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At one point I didn't know whether I should continue or not with what's happening. I got the medications and then, after the third set was done, I asked for more medications and got them," said Djokovic, who also had his knee worked on by a trainer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, who also took a tumble late in the contest, said drier conditions after a week of rain had affected the clay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The injury that I had today with the knee happened exactly because of that, because I slipped and slid a lot," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone slides on clay, but I slipped way too many times. That is quite unusual. I do, because I have an aggressive kind of movement, dynamic change of directions. It's normal for me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've slipped and fallen on the clay many times in my life, and on grass as well, but this was just too many times today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic said his team were having a conversation with tournament officials about why his requests to have the courts swept more frequently were being denied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up next for him is seventh seed Casper Ruud in a rematch of last year's final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I injured myself. I survived. I won the match. Great. But will I be able to play next one? I don't know," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know the severity of the injury. But could have this injury be prevented? Possibly, if there was just a little bit more of frequent care of the court during the set." (Reuters)

    Mbappe completes Real Madrid deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kylian Mbappe is heading to Real Madrid. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755962_1_20240604015001.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France forward Kylian Mbappe has joined Real Madrid as a free agent on a five-year contract, the LaLiga club said on Monday, ending a transfer saga that rumbled on for years before the European champions captured their newest "Galactico".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Real Madrid CF and Kylian Mbappe have reached an agreement whereby he will be a Real Madrid player for the next five seasons," the Spanish champions said in a statement, fresh off their 15th European Cup triumph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old captain of the French national team had announced he was leaving Paris St Germain in a video posted on social media platform X on May 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe will move to Real Madrid in July when his PSG contract expires on June 30 but the forward will be unveiled before joining up with the France squad for the European Championship in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe joins a star-studded side in Madrid with the likes of Ballon d'Or favourites Vinicius Jr. and Jude Bellingham, led by Italian Carlo Ancelotti – the most successful coach in Champions League history with five titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Mbappe won several trophies at PSG, often completing domestic doubles and trebles, the Champions League has eluded him and remains the only major honour left to complete his sparkling resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe leaves PSG after seven years at the club where he won six Ligue 1 titles and four French Cups, finishing his career in the capital city as the club's all-time top scorer with 256 goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2018 World Cup winner surprised PSG last year when he sent a letter stating he would not take up the option of a one-year contract extension when it expires in June. The letter led to a standoff with the club and Mbappe was omitted from the first-team squad before being reinstated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Allowing Mbappe to run down the final year of his contract meant PSG were unable to recoup any of the 180 million euro (US$195.95 million) transfer fee they paid in 2017 to sign him from AS Monaco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid had courted Mbappe in the past but failed to land the player, who signed a contract extension with PSG in May 2022 when the Spanish club had a bid rejected. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea have appointed Enzo Maresca as their new head coach on a five-year contract, the English Premier League club said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian will leave Leicester City, whom he led to promotion back to the Premier League in his first season in charge, and begin his new role on July 1, Chelsea said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has proven himself to be an excellent coach capable of delivering impressive results with an exciting and identifiable style," said Chelsea's sporting co-directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley. His ambitions and work ethic align with those of the club."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leicester were disappointed to see Maresca leave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With Enzo’s decision made and the board’s terms for his departure met, we wish him well in his future endeavours," they said in a statement. "He leaves with the appreciation of everyone at the Club for his work in helping us to achieve an immediate return to the Premier League."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 44-year-old replaced Mauricio Pochettino, who left the club last month after one season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Argentine Pochettino, the west London side put together a strong run late in the season to finish sixth and secure European football, a marked improvement on their 12th-placed finish in the 2022-23 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca will be tasked with returning Chelsea to the Champions League which they won for the second time in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 44-year-old previously coached Manchester City's youth team and was the senior side's assistant coach under Pep Guardiola during their treble-winning season. (Reuters)

    National team eye sweep of Olympic diving golds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will be looking to complete a sweep of the gold medals in diving in the upcoming Paris Olympics, after falling just short in Tokyo three years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Zongyuan, who took gold in the men's synchronised 3m springboard at the Tokyo Games, said the national team are training hard, both physically and mentally, so they would make waves again in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China came first in seven of eight diving events in Tokyo, and Wang said it's the national team's dream to do even better this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First of all, it is the entire diving team's dream to win all eight gold medals at the Olympics, but we have to do our best and work hard to keep on polishing our technique with just two short months before the Games begin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That way, we can thrive in the face of pressure and perform to the best of our abilities to hopefully capture those eight medals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teenager Quan Hongchan, meanwhile, will be looking to defend her 10m platform title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guangdong native, as a 14-year-old, secured three perfect 10s to finish with an Olympic record 466.20 points in Tokyo, more than 40 points ahead of compatriot and silver medallist Chen Yuxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quan said she will perform to the best of her ability in Paris, adding that a gold for either her or teammate Chen will bring honour to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For now, what I mainly want to do is perform my best dive, and not think of other issues. I will just think about my movements, how to do it, and how to dive well," Quan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, I do have confidence. No matter who wins gold between the two of us, as long as it’s a Chinese winning, that’ll be fine.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen, who brought home a gold in the synchronised 10m platform event with Zhang Jiaqi in Tokyo, said members of the national diving team are very supportive of one another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since everyone is representing China, we should collectively aim to bring glory to our country. Whether it’s an individual or a pair event, we should fight hard and aim to bring honour together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the Olympics, we hope that everyone on the team can show their capabilities, their strength and their spirit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three athletes said their families, friends and fans have all been a big part of their athletic careers, so they want to do well to repay them.

    Former England rugby league great Burrow dies aged 41

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Britain's Prince William, Prince of Wales, (right), holding Rob Burrow's CBE, poses for a photo with him and his family at Headlingley Stadium earlier this year. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755831_1_20240603041354.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former England rugby league star Rob Burrow died on Sunday aged 41 after a lengthy battle with motor neurone disease.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Burrow won eight Super League titles, three World Club Challenges and two Challenge Cups during an iconic career with Leeds Rhinos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He retired in 2017 but two years later it was revealed he had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of our beloved son, husband, father, brother and friend," a Leeds statement said on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rob has always been a true inspiration throughout his life whether that was on the rugby league field or during his battle with MND (motor neurone disease).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He never allowed others to define what he could achieve and believed in his own ability to do more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burrow made more than 400 appearances for Leeds between 2001 and 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He raised over £15 million (US$19 million) to help build a new care centre for motor neurone disease patients alongside former team-mate Kevin Sinfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after his diagnosis, Burrow struck a defiant tone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The worst thing for me is people pitying me," he said. "I know it's going to come, but I want to be as normal as ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While I am able-bodied and feel fit and strong and healthy, I want to do normal things and not be treated any differently."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By January 2021, Burrow had lost the use of his hands and arms and began using a wheelchair after his legs became weak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he continued to fund-raise for motor neurone disease charities and in May last year Sinfield carried him over the finish line at the inaugural Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon after pushing his great friend for the 26.2 miles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds plan to recognise the achievements of both Burrow and Sinfield with a statue at their Headingley stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burrow was made an MBE in the 2021 New Year Honours and a CBE in 2024 for his services to the sport and motor neurone disease charities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The outpouring of love and support that Rob and the whole Burrow family have received over the last four and a half years meant so much to Rob," Leeds added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In particular, the rugby league family and MND community have rallied around Rob to inspire him, thank you for your support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those who knew Rob throughout his life, his determination and spirit in the face of MND over the last four and a half years came as no surprise."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player of the match award at this year's Super League Grand Final will be renamed after Burrow, who was the first player to win it twice in 2007 and 2011.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As tributes poured in for one of the sport's most decorated players, the Rugby Football League said: "Since December 2019, his courage and humanity has transcended sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MND Association, for whom Burrow became a patron in 2021, added: "In doing so much, he inspired support from so many.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is testament to the strength of feeling people have for Rob that the support in his name has never wavered."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burrow, who is survived by wife Lindsey and children Macy, Maya and Jackson, won 15 England caps and made five appearances for Great Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He scored 196 tries in his peerless career, but it was the courage he showed throughout his illness-wracked final years that will serve as Burrow's lasting legacy. (AFP)

    Dupont guides France to Rugby Sevens glory

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Antoine Dupont was instrumental in helping France win their first ever Sevens Series. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755829_1_20240603035144.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French rugby star Antoine Dupont, one of the home pin-ups for the Paris Olympics, helped France to a 19-5 victory over Argentina in the grand final of the Rugby Sevens Series in Madrid on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dupont, who captains the France 15-a-side team and starred as his club Toulouse won last week's Champions Cup, played the second-half of the final and was instrumental as the French won their first ever Series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a good group, a good team. I'm very proud of them," said France skipper Paulin Riva. "We have a good, big defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Antoine is the best player in the world, we think! When he's on the pitch we have a lot of confidence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France coach Jerome Daret said the result was "very important for us before the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The next tournament in Paris will be another story!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our aim for Paris is to make a lot of things on the pitch... and give pleasure to the fans."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daret added: "It's not finished, we have a big target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know in Paris it's a home advantage to be in front of our fans and families."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, who lost 26-12 to top-ranked Los Pumas in pool play, looked the better composed team throughout the 20-minute final at Atletico Madrid's Civitas Metropolitano Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French, ranked fifth, thought they'd opened the scoring through Jean-Pascal Barraque, but his knee grazed the touchline just before he crossed the tryline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was Argentina's Luciano Gonzalez who was first on the scoresheet, the forward producing two powerful hand-offs on Stephen Parez-Edo-Martin and Jefferson-Lee Joseph for a fine individual try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But France roared back in collective style from a full 100 metres, Joseph linking well to gift Parez-Edo-Martin, who first played rugby as a student at the French lycee in Madrid, a straight run-in to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Riva conversion handed France a 7-5 half-time lead over Los Pumas, who beat defending two-time Olympic champions Fiji in the semi-final, leaving the South Sea Islanders now 22 Sevens tournaments without a win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupont came on for the second period and made an immediate effect, Rodrigo Isgro yellow carded for a deliberate knock-on of the France scrum-half's midifeld pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tomas Elizalde was on hand to cut down Joseph with a brilliant tackle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a game of strong defences, Argentina struggled to clear their lines and Gonzalez was dragged into touch by Rayan Rabbadj and Riva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the resulting attacking line-out, for which Dupont acted as hooker, the ball was worked wide and Joseph crossed for France's second try, converted by Barraque.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupont then won a turnover penalty. The ball was sent wide, was recycled and who other than Dupont was on hand to draw Elizalde and Isgro and produce a perfectly-timed one-handed pass back inside to Riva, who touched down to make it 19-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isgro received a late red card for an illegal tackle and Riva booted the ball high into the stands as Les Bleus celebrated the victory in what is a perfect tonic going into the Paris Olympics, with the men's competition starting on July 24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia, Olympic champions when rugby sevens made its Games debut in Rio in 2016, won the women's competition, beating France 26-7 in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maddison Levi, who scored an impressive hat-trick of tries, said: "We started getting a roll-on when we had more possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our defence is what is winning us games." (AFP)

    Djokovic bothered by 3am finish at French Open

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic believes "things could have been handled differently" by Roland Garros officials after winning his French Open third round match at a record 3:07 am (0107 GMT) on Sunday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Defending champion and 24-time Grand Slam title winner Djokovic came from two sets to one down to defeat Lorenzo Musetti 7-5, 6-7 (6/8), 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 in a clash which only started just before 10:45 pm (2045 GMT) on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was easily the latest finish to a French Open tie and came after organisers squeezed in extra matches onto the two main show courts, which both have retractable roofs, to counter the scheduling chaos caused by a seventh day of rain in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't want to get into this debate," said Djokovic initially before adding: "I think certain things could have been handled differently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a certain beauty in winning the match at three in the morning if it was the last of the tournament, but this isn't the case."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic's four-hour 29-minute victory allowed the 37-year-old world number one to equal Roger Federer's record of 369 Grand Slam match wins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Physically, I really went to my limits to win this match. When you play rallies of more than 20 shots, at two in the morning.... Who plays at two in the morning?" he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We play few matches in our life at this time. The conditions were very heavy, it was very cold. You didn't have many free points behind your serve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic must now recover to face Argentinian 27th seed Francisco Cerundolo in the round of 16 on Monday after avoiding what would have been his earliest exit at the French Open in 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the late finish in Paris, it is the Australian Open in Melbourne which holds the Grand Slam record – in 2008, Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis played a match until 4:34 am
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the US Open in New York, the latest finish was 2:50 am in 2022 when Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wimbledon operates an 11 pm curfew with the 2012 clash between Andy Murray and Baghdatis ending at a more gentle 11:02 pm. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid withstood a Borussia Dortmund barrage to win the Champions League for the 15th time as Dani Carvajal and Vinicius Junior struck late in a 2-0 win at Wembley on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Right-back Carvajal headed in from Toni Kroos' corner on 74 minutes before Vinicius fired into the far corner to extend the Spanish giants' record as the most successful club in Champions League history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid have now won their last nine European Cup finals and won the competition six times in the last 11 seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, not for the first time in that run, they had to rely on some good fortune as underdogs Dortmund were left to bitterly regret not making the most of their first-half chances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Niclas Fuellkrug hit the post and Karim Adeyemi failed to convert a one-on-one with Thibaut Courtois.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid, though, always seem to find a way in Europe's elite competition and made more history in the English capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carvajal, Kroos, Nacho and Luka Modric joined Real legend Paco Gento as the only players to win the European Cup six times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carlo Ancelotti also extended his record as the most successful coach in the competition's history with his fifth title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A record number of more than 2,500 stewards were in place at Wembley with the authorities keen to avoid a repeat of the violent scenes that marred the Euro 2020 final three years ago when ticketless fans stormed the turnstiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But further questions over the security operation will be raised as three pitch invaders were able to enter the field in the opening minutes of the game, with one taking photos alongside Jude Bellingham and Vinicius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti said pre-match he felt "like a lion" after an afternoon siesta, but his side were caught napping for the first 45 minutes as, roared on by the travelling thousands from Germany, Dortmund dominated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti's decision to recall Courtois for his first Champions League appearance of the season after a serious knee injury paid dividends as the Belgian kept his side in the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best chances fell to Adeyemi as Carvajal could not contain the German international's pace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A brilliant pass by Mats Hummels put Adeyemi clean through, but he took a heavy touch under pressure from Courtois and ran too wide before his shot was blocked by Carvajal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuellkrug's barrel-chested physique has made him a fan favourite in his first season at Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German international striker came closest to breaking the deadlock before half-time when his effort from Ian Maatsen's through ball came back off the inside of the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adeyemi was then denied once more by Courtois from a narrow angle and Fuellkrug could not twist his hulking frame to turn in the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti, Nacho and Modric were keen to stress on the eve of the match that Madrid's habit of finding a way to get over the line in the Champions League was no coincidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having ridden their luck once more in the first half, the Spanish champions found their feet in the second period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gregor Kobel was finally forced into a save on 48 minutes from Kroos, who came close to marking the final game of his club career with a spectacular free-kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham was moulded into a world star during three years at Dortmund before leaving for Madrid 12 months ago for more than 100 million euros (US$108 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England international was inches away from biting the hand that used to feed him as he just could not get a telling touch on Vinicius' teasing cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid landed the decisive blow 16 minutes from time when Carvajal rose highest to head in Kroos' corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kobel then briefly kept his side alive with fine saves from Eduardo Camavinga and Nacho, while Bellingham's goalbound effort was deflected behind by Nico Schlotterbeck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Bellingham did have a moment to savour on his homecoming as his pass teed up Vinicius to kill of Dortmund despite Kobel getting a hand to the Brazilian's scuffed shot. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 City of Troy won the Derby on Saturday to give trainer Aidan O'Brien a record-extending 10th success in the Epsom classic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 3-1 favourite put a dismal run in the English 2,000 Guineas behind him to seal the Blue Riband, just as O'Brien's Auguste Rodin had done 12 months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was hard to know what would happen today but we still thought we had the best horse. It just didn't happen in the Guineas," said jockey Ryan Moore, partnering his fourth Derby winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City of Troy beat Ambiente Friendly (9-2) with another O'Brien runner Los Angeles (6-1) in third. (AFP)

    Everton pull plug on controversial takeover bid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Everton's owners are said to be considering their options. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755713_1_20240601162959.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everton's takeover agreement with prospective owner 777 Partners has expired, the Premier League club said on Saturday, after the US private equity firm failed to complete the acquisition of Farhad Moshiri's majority stake by the Friday deadline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In September the Miami-based investment fund said it had signed an agreement with British-Iranian billionaire Moshiri to acquire his 94.1 percent stake in the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal, initially expected to be closed by the end of 2023, was delayed as 777 Partners reportedly struggled to meet the necessary conditions outlined by the Premier League to complete their purchase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The agreement between 777 Partners and Blue Heaven Holdings Limited for the sale and purchase of the majority shareholding in the club expired today," Everton said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club's Board of Directors recognises the considerable level of financial support 777 Partners has provided the club over recent months and would like to take this opportunity to thank them for this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moshiri, a former Arsenal shareholder, first bought a 49.9 percent stake in Everton in 2016. By January 2022, he had increased his stake to 94.1 percent with a 100-million-pound (US$130-million) capital injection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite investing nearly US$810 million in transfers to build the squad since Moshiri's arrival, Everton have slipped out of the top half of the table to fight relegation battles in recent seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club finished 15th in the Premier League after being hit with two separate points deductions for breaching profit and sustainability rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton are now free to talk to other interested investors, with the BBC reporting that Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor, who is looking to sell his majority stake in the London club, would consider Everton as an opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The club will continue to operate as usual, while it works with Blue Heaven Holdings to assess all options for the club’s future ownership," Everton said. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ryan Nugent-Hopkins on the attack in the Oilers' victory over Dallas. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755690_1_20240601122614.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored a pair of power-play goals to lead the Edmonton Oilers to a 3-1 victory over the host Dallas Stars on Friday and put them one win away from the Stanley Cup Final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Philip Broberg added his first career playoff goal and Stuart Skinner made 19 saves for the Oilers, who lead the best-of-seven Western Conference final 3-2. They will try to finish the series Sunday night at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even Bouchard posted two assists, which gives the defenseman 25 points in Edmonton's 17 playoff games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wyatt Johnston replied for the Stars, the conference's regular-season champions, who have lost two straight games in the series. Goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 23 shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nugent-Hopkins netted the first power-play goal of the series for either team when he opened the scoring at 14:09 of the first period. After Bouchard's point shot was stopped, Nugent-Hopkins chipped a back-handed rebound attempt into the cage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nugent-Hopkins, the 2011 first overall draft choice who is Edmonton's longest serving player, doubled the lead with another man-advantage marker 66 seconds into the second period. He was fed a pass in the slot and whipped a shot off the post and into the net for his sixth goal of the playoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Broberg, who played his first game of the playoffs in Game 4, netted his milestone marker at 5:09 of the middle frame with a long slap shot that beat Oettinger's glove hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnston finally put the Stars on the board with 5:51 remaining in regulation by deflecting a point shot for his 10th goal of the playoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It snapped Skinner's shutout streak at 108 minutes and 43 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Stars, who were held to only four shots on goal in the first period, had a tough time generating many shots the whole game, but Skinner provided a few key saves, including a clutch denial of Johnston's attempt from the slot when it was a 2-0 count.

Photo: Courtesy of SwimSwam" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755653_1_20240601062320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey continues to showcase strong in-season form through the 2024 season. In the 200m freestyle in Barcelona she took down the late Camille Muffat‘s Mare Nostrum Tour record, which had stood since 2008. Haughey clocked 1:54.57 for the win, undercutting Muffat’s record by .09 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey split 26.99/28.78/29.08/29.72 for the win and the new record. She is already ranked 3rd in the world this season behind Mollie O’Callaghan and Summer McIntosh with her 1:5408 from the Budapest stop of the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the race by more than three seconds, with Valentine Valerie Dumont the closest swimmer to her in 1:57.92. Dumont’s season best stands at 1:57.57 from back in February but this was another solid in-season swim from her and the 4th fastest of her career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey had to settle for silver in the women’s 50 freestyle, as Sweden’s Michelle Coleman eked out the win, out-touching her by .03 seconds. Coleman earned the win in 24.61, improving on her season best time from the 2024 World Championships (24.65).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her first race of the session, Haughey swam 24.64. That’s the 4th fastest swim of her career and her fastest in 2024. Her 2023-24 season best is a 24.62 from the U.S Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia’s Neža Klančar earned 3rd place in 24.83. Like Haughey, it’s her fastest swim in 2024 as it betters the 24.87 mark that she swam in Doha. In December, she swam her personal best of 24.70. (SwimSwam)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappe's highly anticipated move to Spanish champions Real Madrid will be made official early next week, a source close to the negotiations said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The captain of the French national team, who will be available on June 30 when his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires, has decided to sign for Real after seven seasons in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His entourage did not immediately respond to enquiries about the rumour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the move is announced as expected on Monday or Tuesday, Mbappe is unlikely, according to several media outlets, to be presented in the Spanish capital before the end of Euro 2024, which runs from June 14 to July 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the moment, he is expected to remain with the France team which has been in camp in Clairefontaine since Wednesday ahead of two Euro warm-up matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They face Luxembourg in Metz on Wednesday and Canada in Bordeaux four days later. (AFP)

 The Dallas Mavericks, fueled by 36 points each from Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-103 on Thursday to clinch the Western Conference crown and book an NBA title showdown with the Boston Celtics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Denied a sweep at home on Tuesday, the Mavs left no room for doubt in Minneapolis as they wrapped up the best-of-seven conference finals 4-1 to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since they won the title in 2011.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics will host game one of the championship series on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenian star Doncic and Irving had their way with the league's top-rated defense, Doncic taking the game by the throat in the opening minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He scored four of his six three-pointers in the first period, including a bomb from the center court logo, and the Mavs closed the quarter on a 17-1 scoring run to put the Timberwolves on their heels for good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irving got going with 15 points in the second quarter as he and Doncic combined for 44 first-half points – four more than the Timberwolves put on the board before halftime, when the Mavs led 69-40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 28 points each for Minnesota, Towns adding 12 rebounds for the third-seed Timberwolves, who had swept the Phoenix Suns in the first round and stunned the defending champion Denver Nuggets in seven games in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves had been 3-0 in elimination games this post-season, with wins in games six and seven against the Nuggets as well as their victory on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the early damage by Doncic and Dallas' disruptive defense put this one out of reach early and the Mavs grabbed the first double-digit victory of a hard-fought series.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong boxer Ruru Yang became WIBA Super Bantamweight champion on Thursday, defeating Thailand's Tanwarat Saengiamjit in Bangkok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old won by unanimous decision after 10 rounds in the Thai capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She adds the previously-vacant WIBA Super Bantamweight belt to her WBC Asia Super Flyweight crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang went into the bout with an undefeated record in five professional fights, with two wins coming by way of TKO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saengiamjit, with a record of nine wins and one loss, had already failed at a shot at the super bantamweight title in 2015 –  when she lost to New Zealand's Gentiane Lupi
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang is now undefeated in six fights since turning professional in 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna has ended speculation about his immediate future by signing a new four-year contract on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McKenna, 38, led the Portman Road club to a second successive promotion last season as Ipswich returned to the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That achievement saw him linked with the managerial vacancies at English top-flight rivals Brighton, Chelsea and Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am extremely proud to have signed a new contract with the club," McKenna told Ipswich's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have enjoyed incredible success together over the last two seasons and I'm excited to have the opportunity and responsibility of leading this fantastic club into its first season in the Premier League in 22 years." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull has purchased a minority stake in Leeds United and will become the English second-tier football club's main shirt sponsor next season, it was announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The global drinks brand, best known in sport as the backer of the world champion Formula One team, are already involved with football clubs RB Leipzig, Red Bull Salzburg and New York Red Bulls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am thrilled that Red Bull is joining us to build a bright future for Leeds United and shares our deep respect for this truly special club," said United chairman Paraag Marathe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As chairman, our consortium of investment partners will be invaluable to me as we approach this important moment for the club, now and into the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Red Bull's addition is a historic milestone that will further empower the club to reach its full competitive potential."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds will spend a second consecutive season back in the Championship after losing to Southampton in last Sunday's play-off final at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull chief executive of corporate projects and investments Oliver Mintzlaff said the company hoped to help the Yorkshire club back into the top flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ambition to bring Leeds United back to the Premier League and establish themselves in the best football league in the world fits very well with Red Bull." (AFP)

 Siobhan Haughey won her fourth gold medal of the Mare Nostrum Swim Tour on Wednesday, this one coming in the 100m freestyle event on Day 1 in Barcelona.

  <br/>
  Competing in her only discipline on the opening day, a time of 55.45 seconds was enough to easily see the 26-year-old through the preliminary heats.

  <br/>
  The Hong Kong swimmer then improved her time to 52.76 in the final, touching the wall 1.11 seconds ahead of Swedish swimmer Michelle Coleman.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prosecutors in Kentucky on Wednesday dropped all charges against top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler, who was arrested after allegedly ignoring police at a traffic stop outside the US PGA Championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, 27, was handcuffed and led away by officers in the pre-dawn incident on May 17, before having his mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit and then returning from jail to the Valhalla course and teeing off for his second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler allegedly drove onto a curb near the course entrance after police set up a traffic stop due to a separate road accident in which a local man working at the tournament had been killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police report said Scheffler had disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, dragging to the ground police officer Bryan Gillis, who was hospitalized with bruising and swelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell lodged a motion in court to dismiss all charges against Scheffler and the judge agreed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connell told the court that the evidence against Scheffler did not meet the standard of probable cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on the totality of the evidence my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges filed against Mr Scheffler," O'Connell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler had been charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His lawyer Steve Romines denied any wrongdoing, adding Scheffler was driving a marked player's vehicle when he received conflicting signals from police officers at the traffic control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romines had stressed that his client would fight the charges and was "not interested in any sort of settlement negotiations or anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the morning of his arrest, world number-one Scheffler released a statement saying "there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connell told the court in Louisville that Scheffler's claim of misunderstanding "is corroborated by the evidence." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Japan's Naomi Osaka in action during her second round defeat. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755308_1_20240530084305.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Iga Swiatek escaped from match point down against Naomi Osaka to reach the French Open third round on Wednesday, while Carlos Alcaraz overcame a scare of his own as persistent rain caused widespread disruption to the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swiatek outlasted fellow four-time Grand Slam winner Osaka 7-6 [7/1], 1-6, 7-5 in a breathtaking second-round clash, livening a gloomy day in which 23 singles matches were postponed until Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Swiatek won the last five games of the match to keep her bid for a third successive Roland Garros title on track. Justine Henin was the last woman to achieve the feat in 2005-07.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Osaka, appearing at only a second Grand Slam since giving birth to her daughter last July, was on the cusp of her biggest win since returning to tennis at the start of the year but took a philosophical view to an agonising defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three break points eluded Swiatek to start the deciding set and Osaka's clean hitting quickly had her opponent again on the back foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Osaka blasted a backhand winner to break for a 2-0 advantage before demonstrating her resolve once more to save another five break points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek fended off a break opportunity to stay in touch at 2-4, but she looked doomed when Osaka brought up match point three games later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A terrific return kept her alive and a loose backhand from Osaka handed Swiatek a break to get back to 4-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a tough hold, Swiatek broke again to move 6-5 in front before holding her nerve to wrap up victory after nearly three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Open champion and third seed Coco Gauff defeated Slovenia's Tamara Zidansek 6-3, 6-4, while eighth seed Ons Jabeur overcame Colombia's Camila Osorio in three sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz shook off a third-set blip against world number 176 Jesper de Jong before the Spaniard came through 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 under the roof on Court Philippe Chatrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the men's draw were Second seed Jannik Sinner, Sixth seed Andrey Rublev and former French Open finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas. (AFP)

    Jørn Andersen resigns as SAR head coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jørn Andersen resigns as SAR head coach" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755176_1_20240529122646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong football head coach Jørn Andersen announced on Wednesday that he has resigned with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Andersen said he had received an offer "he couldn't refuse", without disclosing which club it came from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that the local football association "had made every effort to retain" him, offering him a new three-year contract being as his original deal was due to expire next summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After much careful consideration, I have made a difficult decision and decide to take a new challenge, and step down as coach of the Hong Kong, China representative team," Andersen said at a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have recently received an invitation from a club outside that presents an opportunity that I simply cannot refuse."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian thanked the Football Association of Hong Kong, China, as well as the SAR government, his staff, players and the fans for their support throughout "a fantastic journey" in the past two and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thank all the players who train with me, play with me. And at last, I thank all the great Hong Kong fans who support us everywhere, wherever we were playing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, the coach, 61, had spoken to the press about the association not offering him a new contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association, for its part, said Andersen informed them of his intention to leave on Monday, and officially tabled his resignation on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant coach Wolfgang Luisser has been named interim head coach, with Szeto Man-chun joining the coaching staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andersen took up the head coach role in late 2021. He is considered to have successfully changed the team's culture by playing with a high pressing, attacking style that was relatively rare in the SAR squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, he led the team to its first Asian Cup berth since 1968, with the squad putting up inspiring battles despite defeats against Asian heavyweights Iran and the United Arab Emirates, as well as a surprising Palestinian team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team Hong Kong, China also made history at the Hangzhou Asian Games last year, when Andersen took the under-23 squad to advance to the semi-final stage for the first time ever.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local star footballer Philip Chan won the Hong Kong Footballer of the Year award on Tuesday, the first player from the SAR to do so since goalkeeper Edmond Yapp in 2016.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Tai Po midfielder scooped three further trophies at the Top Football Awards Ceremony, including Fan's Favourite, with over 4,500 votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He took home a total of HK$60,000 in prize money by also winning the award for the best player from the local top-flight representing the SAR in international competition, as well as being named one of the midfielders in the season's Best XI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Po finished second in the league this season, with Chan often scoring last-minute winners for the team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder, 31, also scored the 1,000th goal in the history of the Asian Cup in January while playing for the SAR team in Qatar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Eastern swept a number of awards, with Roberto Losada winning Coach of the Year, striker Noah Baffoe Player's Favourite, and midfielders Jesse Yu and Ma Hei-wai named Young Players of the Year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Novak Djokovic shrugged off his recent troubles to sweep to his 93rd career win at the French Open on Tuesday, extending his run of first round Roland Garros victories to a perfect 20.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, chasing a fourth title in Paris and record 25th Grand Slam triumph, came through against 142nd-ranked French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-4, 7-6 [7/3], 6-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old, who saw career-long rival and 14-time champion Rafael Nadal exit the tournament on Monday, had arrived under a cloud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time since 2018, he is without a title and has yet to reach a final this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a victory in three sets, that's what matters at this moment. I felt better compared to the last few weeks. I was focused. I encouraged myself, I am satisfied with my state of mind," said Djokovic
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, who has advanced to the French Open quarter-finals or better every year since 2010, will face Spain's 63rd-ranked Roberto Carballes Baena for a place in the last 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka, a semi-finalist in 2023, over-powered Russian teenager Erika Andreeva 6-1, 6-2 in just 68 minutes under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier as heavy rain caused a five-hour delay to action around the grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm trying to do well on clay, it is tough conditions here but I enjoy playing here and I'm just trying to bring my best tennis every time -- whatever the surface," said Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was better luck for Andreeva's younger sister Mirra, who went to the fourth round as a 16-year-old in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She swept past Emina Bektas of the United States in straights sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time runner-up Casper Ruud, who won clay-court titles in Barcelona and Geneva in the build-up to Roland Garros, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Brazilian qualifier Felipe Meligeni Alves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Frenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended with a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Qinwen in her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng, losing 6-2, 6-1. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The four fencers representing the SAR in the Olympics on Tuesday said they hope to use the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait next month as final preparation for Paris in July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Star fencer Vivian Kong has won several large events, including the Fujairah Women's Epee World Cup 2024 and the Barcelona Women's Epee World Cup 2024, but has yet to win an Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she still has to give it her all, even though this will be her third Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's like psychologically and mentally [where] I need to be calm and that's like usually the hardest part when we compete especially in foreign competitions. Technically, it's all my coach [Octavian Zidaru]. He knows every action we work on," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's always like this one higher, this one lower, this one point more accurately, so there's always something wrong with my actions, so I have to work hard to make him happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Olympic gold-medallist Edgar Cheung said he doesn't want to let the pressure to win another medal affect his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the competition in Kuwait will give him another practice opportunity before the Games, adding that it's vital to perform to the best of his ability and enjoy the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, there are challenges but for me, it is like preparing well for myself, and give all my best, and afterwards, we will see what happens. I think me and Vivian had quite a good experience about the Olympics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the two of the rest, one is my ex-roommate so we are friends. We have been talking about the Olympics, how it is and I just told them to enjoy and to have fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Epee fencer Cedric Ho said he is excited to have booked his place in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though I'm really excited, I do want to bring that energy down a little and enter the Olympics with a calm mindset," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will be going to the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait at the end of June, and those results will determine our rankings in the Olympics. I will use that competition as a prep for the Games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for Daphne Chan, she said she doesn't have specific expectations from the Games, and is just looking forward to learning from her teammates and staying focused for Paris.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong triathlete Jason Ng has beaten Ayan Beisenbayev from Kazakhstan for the remaining spot in Paris Olympic qualification reserved for the highest-ranked Asian nation or region that hadn't already made it through to the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng had been going neck to neck against Beisenbayev for the remaining place, after Japan's top three athletes secured spots based on individual Olympic rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the weekend's Asia Triathlon Cup, Ng was disqualified for wearing a helmet during the running portion of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, given that Beisenbayev failed to finish on the podium to accumulate the points he needed, Hong Kong were able to win a spot in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng secured the 33rd ticket for the SAR delegation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Boston Celtics clinched the Eastern Conference championship on Monday with a 105-102 win over the Indiana Pacers, sweeping the series 4-0 and booking a spot in the NBA Finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Celtics will face the winner of the Western Conference finals, where the Dallas Mavericks hold a 3-0 over the Minnesota Timberwolves ahead of Tuesday's game four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics win in Indianapolis was their seventh straight in the post-season but they left it late against a Pacers team again without injured star guard Tyrese Haliburton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaylen Brown once again proved decisive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hit a step through to level at 102-102 with 2:40 left in the fourth, then superbly rose to block Andrew Nembhard at the rim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With 45 seconds remaining Brown found Derrick White in the corner who sank the three-point jumper that ultimately clinched the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nembhard, who had 24 points, 10 assists and six rebounds for the Pacers, missed a three-pointer with 33 seconds left which would have tied the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown led Boston's scoring with 29 points and Jayson Tatum had 26 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics return to the finals two years after losing to the Golden State Warriors as they search for their first NBA title since 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the third time in the four series games that Indiana had lost after holding leads or being tied in the final minute of a game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Expectations will be raised for next year, which is good," said Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are challenges to meet over the summer for our guys to get better, all of us involved need to get better," he added. (AFP)

    Nadal crashes out in likely French Open farewell

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafa Nadal salutes the Roland Garos fans after what could be his final French Open match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754957_1_20240528005047.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafa Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title. (Reuters)

    Braves' Acuña out for season with torn knee ligament

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Atlanta Braves star outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. is out for the remainder of the season after suffering a complete tear of the ACL in his left knee on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Acuña, the reigning National League MVP, injured the knee in the first inning of Sunday afternoon's 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates. Despite telling reporters that he did not think he tore the ligament, Acuña underwent an MRI exam and the Braves announced the results late Sunday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old will undergo surgery at a later date, the team said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acuña led off Sunday's game with a double to right-centre field off Pirates left-hander Martin Perez. He made a move toward third base with Marcell Ozuna batting and fell awkwardly to the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He remained on the ground for several minutes before slowly limping off the field. Jarred Kelenic replaced Acuña in the Atlanta lineup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I saw the catcher throwing the ball back to the pitcher very slow," Acuña said through an interpreter. "I was timing that so I could steal third. But in that moment, he threw it hard. So I had to come back, and that's when I felt it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Braves manager Brian Snitker called Acuña's injury "very concerning" before the results of his testing came in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acuña tore the ACL in his right knee on July 10, 2021, and returned 9 1/2 months later early in the 2022 season. He also sprained his left ACL in May 2018 and was sidelined for just more than a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finishes his abbreviated seventh MLB season with a .250 batting average, four home runs and 15 RBIs in 49 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first player in MLB history to accomplish a 40-home run, 70-steal season, Acuña is a career .289 hitter with 165 homers and 417 RBIs in 722 games. He's a four-time All-Star and was the unanimous NL MVP in 2023. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving combined for 66 points and Dallas surged home in a 116-107 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday that gave the Mavericks a 3-0 stranglehold on their NBA Western Conference final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latest thriller in the series, this time in Dallas, came after the Mavs won games one and two in Minneapolis by a total of four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a fourth quarter that saw the teams trade the lead seven times, the star Mavs duo spearheaded a closing 12-3 scoring run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks will have their first chance to clinch the series when they host game four on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No team has rallied from 3-0 down to win an NBA playoff series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic and Irving each finished with 33 points, Doncic adding seven rebounds and five assists and Irving producing 14 of his points in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  P.J. Washington scored 16 points, draining a three-pointer that put Dallas up for good, 107-104, with 3:38 to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Gafford blocked three shots for Dallas, including a monster rejection on Mike Conley in the final minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 26 points, but had just four in the fourth quarter. Anthony Edwards missed all four of his attempts in the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bruising contest saw the Mavericks lose Dereck Lively early in the second quarter after the rookie reserve took a knee to the back of the head from a leaping Karl-Anthony Towns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The frightening moment brought Mavs coach Jason Kidd out to check on Lively, who had already taken a painful knee to the groin from Towns trying to guard him under the basket. (AFP)

 Hong Kong's star swimmer Siobhan Haughey snapped up three gold medals in the first leg of the Mare Nostrum Swim Tour in France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Olympic medallist won her first gold on day one in the 100m breaststroke in the town of Canet-en-Roussillon, where she finished with a time of 1 minute, 7.01 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey then captured her second gold of the session with a stunning time of 1 minute, 55.39 seconds in the women's 200m freestyle, ultimately beating the pack by over three seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On day two, she sealed her third gold medal, in the 100m freestyle event in 52.55 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Ian Ho, who like Haughey has qualified for the Paris Olympics this summer, won bronze in the men's 50m freestyle event with a time of 22.38 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was only .01 seconds behind the silver medallist, Dylan Carter of Trinidad and Tobago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next leg of the tour is due to take place from May 29 to May 30 in Barcelona.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton won promotion back to the Premier League by beating Leeds United 1-0 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, earning an immediate return to England’s top tier in a game considered the richest in world football.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Adam Armstrong was the match-winner as his first-half goal was enough to see off a Leeds side that struggled to muster a meaningful response, with substitute Daniel James coming closest when his shot hit the bar late in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton join Championship winners Leicester City and runners-up Ipswich Town in the Premier League next season, the latter promoted after a 22-year absence from the top flight, while the Foxes, like Saints, went up at the first attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton got the decisive goal after 24 minutes when Armstrong latched onto a through ball by Will Smallbone and slid it past keeper Illan Meslier for his 24th goal of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promotion means Saints are set to receive a windfall of at least US$178 million, according to analysis from Deloitte’s Sports Business Group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rewards on offer resulted in a cagey affair with a lack of clear chances and Southampton would have been pleased to see Leeds substitute Italy winger Wilfried Gnonto and Championship Player of the Year Crysencio Summerville in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine minutes of stoppage time gave Daniel Farke's trailing Yorkshire side hope and they huffed and puffed but failed to break down the excellent Saints defence. (Reuters)

    Leclerc's dream comes true with home win in Monaco

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc celebrated a boyhood dream come true on Sunday as the first home winner of Formula One's showcase Monaco Grand Prix since Louis Chiron triumphed in 1931.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was also the first time the 26-year-old had stood on the Monaco podium in six attempts and came after two standing starts from pole position in a race halted when first-lap collisions took out a fifth of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri finished runner-up, 7.1 seconds behind after 78 laps without a chance to overtake on a street circuit that often produces processional races, and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It means a lot," said Leclerc, who screamed over the radio as he took a chequered flag waved by France soccer forward Kylian Mbappe while the crowd erupted and Prince Albert gave a royal thumbs up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the race that made me dream of becoming a Formula One driver one day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's championship leader and 2023 Monaco winner Max Verstappen started and finished sixth, the third time in eight races this season that the triple world champion has been beaten.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Lando Norris was fourth and George Russell fifth for Mercedes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was seventh, with a bonus point for fastest lap, and Yuki Tsunoda eighth for Red Bull-owned RB.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Albon scored Williams's first points of the season in ninth and Pierre Gasly took the final one for Alpine despite a first-lap collision with team mate Esteban Ocon, whose race ended immediately. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US golfer Grayson Murray, who won his second PGA Tour title at the Sony Open in January, died on Saturday at the age of 30, the tour said in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murray had withdrawn from the Charles Schwab Challenge with an unspecified illness during Friday's second round in Texas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were devastated to learn - and are heartbroken to share - that PGA Tour player Grayson Murray passed away this morning. I am at a loss for words," PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The PGA Tour is a family, and when you lose a member of your family, you are never the same. We mourn Grayson and pray for comfort for his loved ones."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monahan said he had spoken with Murray's parents to offer condolences and they had "asked that we continue with tournament play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were adamant that Grayson would want us to do so. As difficult as it will be, we want to respect their wishes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour did not specify a cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray's second career title in Hawaii in January was an emotional affair, capping a stunning personal comeback from alcohol abuse and mental health issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray, who had claimed his only prior tour title as a rookie at the 2017 Barbasol Championship, had also been slowed by a motor scooter accident in Bermuda in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After rolling in a 38-foot birdie putt to win a three-man playoff, Murray said he hoped his return to the winner's circle could provide inspiration for others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I can help one person that's all it takes," he said in Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not easy," Murray mused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wanted to give up a lot of times -- give up on myself, give up on the game of golf, give up on life at times," he said, adding that he hoped his legacy going forward would be to be "known as a good person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray had been tabbed for stardom from a young age.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was just 16 when he made his first cut on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour and won three straight Junior World Championships from 2006-08.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A solid season on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2023 saw him return to the PGA Tour, and his Sony Open victory saw him reach a career high 46th in the world rankings. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Adam Idah scored a 90th-minute winner as Celtic beat Glasgow rivals Rangers 1-0 on Saturday to lift the Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A scrappy game was decided by an error as Jack Butland fumbled Paulo Bernardo's effort and Idah pounced for his ninth goal of a loan spell from Norwich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said I'd come here to try and score as many goals as I could, I didn't think I'd score a goal like this in front of all these fans. It's an amazing feeling," said Idah, who only made the move to Glasgow in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's hard to put into words. Anyone here can see what it means to the fans, to the players. I've always supported Celtic, it's amazing!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rangers thought they had taken the lead earlier in the second half when Abdallah Sima turned home a corner at the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after a VAR review, Celtic goalkeeper Joe Hart was handed a reprieve in the final match of his career as the former England international had been pushed by Nico Raskin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Celtic were far from their best but maintained their unbeaten record in five meetings against Rangers this season, which has also secured them direct qualification for next season's Champions League by winning the Scottish Premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory also continued Brendan Rodgers' remarkable Scottish Cup record across two spells in charge of the Hoops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodgers has never lost a Scottish Cup tie in 17 matches and takes his trophy haul as a Celtic boss to nine in three-and-a-half seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Celtic's win also has historical significance as they move level with Rangers' total of 118 trophies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head-to-head between the clubs is also now level after 441 meetings with 169 wins each and 103 draws. (AFP)

    Barca avenge Lyon defeats to win third Women's CL

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bonmati celebrates after her deflected shot gives Barca the lead. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754706_1_20240526032142.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas struck to earn Barcelona their third women's Champions League trophy, securing a 2-0 triumph over record eight-time winners Lyon on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defending champions had never beaten the French giants, losing in the 2019 and 2022 finals against them, but finally succeeded in Bilbao to compete a spectacular quadruple this season in coach Jonatan Giraldez's last match in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonmati pounced after 63 minutes and substitute Putellas finished the job in stoppage time to avenge Barcelona's prior defeats by Sonia Bompastor's side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Securing their third Champions League trophy from five final appearances across the last six seasons, Barcelona demonstrated that they are the new powerhouse of the women's game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barca stars insisted this time they were capable of beating Lyon, adding experience and mental strength to their undoubted talent, and so it proved at a packed San Mames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Backed by the vast majority of a 51,000 record crowd at a women's Champions League final, Bonmati and her side completed one of the few outstanding challenges remaining to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giraldez started Mariona Caldentey in attack and moved Fridolina Rolfo to left-back, dropping Ona Batlle to the bench alongside two-time Ballon d'Or winner Putellas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lyon left Ada Hegerberg on the bench too, with the all-time top scorer in the competition's history struggling for form after injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lucy Bronze deflected a ball onto her own crossbar and Lyon's towering captain Wendie Renard hit the outside of the post as Barcelona suffered a couple of early jitters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After going four goals down by half-time in the 2019 final and three down in 2022, this time the Catalans dug deep to hold it together at the back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They threatened increasingly at the other end. Patri Guijarro, who scored twice in last year's final against Wolfsburg, broke in behind for their first big chance after half an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Christiane Endler saved her effort from an angle and Selma Bacha cleared the ball off the line after it rebounded back towards goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caroline Graham Hansen, in sparkling form this season, gave left-back Bacha a torrid time and had 11-time finalist Renard uncertainly backpedalling fearfully near the end of the first half, but dragged her shot wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barcelona made their quality count in the 63rd minute when Bonmati sent them ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ballon d'Or winner had been quiet but arrived just at the right time to collect Caldentey's clever pass and burst into the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonmati's low shot deflected off Vanessa Gilles and flew over the helpless Endler, for her sixth goal of the tournament and the most crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Champions League top goalscorer Kadidiatou Diani curled agonisingly over for Lyon as Bompastor's side tried to fight back. Hegerberg headed over as Lyon's chances ebbed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eventually Putellas, on as a late substitute, settled the game by rifling into the top corner late on to get Barcelona's celebrations started early. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Al-Ain thrashed 10-man Yokohama F Marinos 5-1 in the second leg of the Asian Champions League final on Saturday to lift the continental title for the first time in 21 years with a 6-3 aggregate win over the Japanese side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The United Arab Emirates team overturned a 2-1 first-leg deficit, with Soufiane Rahimi and Kodjo Laba both scoring twice and Kaku also on target against a Marinos team for whom Yan Matheus scored and goalkeeper William Popp was sent off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Ain, who last won the title in 2003, levelled the aggregate score in the eighth minute, Rahimi slotting home after latching onto Yahia Nader's clever back heel and, by the 33rd minute, the home side had taken the lead in the tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahimi was involved again, the Moroccan brought down by Shinnosuke Hatanaka to allow Paraguayan playmaker Kaku to step up and score from the penalty spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven minutes later, however, Marinos struck when Khalid Eisa was unable to do enough to palm Matheus' low shot to safety and the aggregate score was level again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marinos's task became more complicated deep into first half injury time when Popp was sent off for bringing down Rahimi as the Moroccan raced towards goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahimi then hit Al-Ain's crucial third in the 67th minute as he capitalised on the inability of the Marinos defence to clear, beating substitute goalkeeper Fuma Shirasaka with a left-foot shot inside his near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Laba struck twice after his late introduction – in the 91st and 95th minutes – following more poor defending to put the seal on a remarkable win. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="United manager Erik ten Hag hopes winning the FA Cup will save him from the sack.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erik ten Hag made a convincing case to be spared the sack as Manchester United upset Manchester City to take the FA Cup with a shock 2-1 victory in Saturday's final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag was reportedly set to be dismissed regardless of the result at Wembley after a troubled campaign that even the United manager described as "terrible" this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But United's hierarchy might be having second thoughts after Ten Hag's tactical masterclass ruined City's history bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were hot favourites to win a second successive Premier League and FA Cup double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet Ten Hag found a way to neutralise Pep Guardiola's side as first half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo put United on course to win the FA Cup for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeremy Doku squeezed an 87th minute strike past Andre Onana's weak attempted save but it was too late to rescue City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having ended a turbulent season on a high note, if Ten Hag's two-year reign does end, his exit would provoke memories of fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal's Old Trafford departure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Van Gaal was fired just two days after United's FA Cup final victory against Crystal Palace in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag will hope a more apt comparison is Alex Ferguson's 1990 FA Cup final win against Palace, which kick-started his remarkable run after calls for his sacking earlier that season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferguson was in attendance as a match labelled Ten Hag's funeral turned into a triumph for the much-maligned Dutchman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United shareholder Jim Ratcliffe, who has control of football operations at Old Trafford, was also watching from the stands alongside co-owners Joel and Avie Glazer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linked with Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino and Gareth Southgate, among others, there is still plenty for Ratcliffe to ponder after United finished eighth in the Premier League this season – their lowest final position since 1990 – and crashed out of the Champions League in the group stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag believes a lengthy injury list was the root of the problems and can point to the two trophies he has won in three cup final appearances with United as proof of what he can do when his team are at full strength.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag ended United's six-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup last year and has now avenged their 2-1 loss to City in the FA Cup final 12 months ago despite finishing 31 points behind the champions this term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United will also qualify for the Europa League, avoiding a first season without European action since 2014-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They benefitted from an unusually tepid City performance as their double bid fell flat in their first domestic defeat since losing at Aston Villa in the league 171 days ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last weekend, City became the first team to win the Premier League in four consecutive seasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Guardiola's men looked hungover after the celebrations that followed their sixth title in seven years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were furious when their strong penalty appeal was rejected inside the first minute after Lisandro Martinez's shove sent Erling Haaland sprawling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Content to sit deep with all 11 men behind the ball, United stifled City impressively and gleefully accepted their gift-wrapped opener in the 30th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diogo Dalot's punt forward should have been dealt with by Josko Gvardiol, but the left-back hesitated as he looked for an offside flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gvardiol headed the ball over City keeper Stefan Ortega, who had rashly rushed off his line, leaving Garnacho with the simple task of tapping into the empty net as Ten Hag clenched his fist in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho, 19, was the first teenager to score in the FA Cup final since Cristiano Ronaldo for United against Millwall 20 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just nine minutes later, the 19-year-old Mainoo punished more sloppy City defending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho advanced unchecked down the right wing and found Fernandes, whose superb first-time pass reached the unmarked Mainoo for a clinical close-range finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City pushed harder after the interval but although Doku's shot slipped through Onana's grasp to set up a tense finale, it wasn't enough to deny United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the final seconds ticked away, Ten Hag stood in the sunshine nervously waiting to celebrate a dramatic win that could earn an unexpected stay of execution or serve as his final fling. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Novak Djokovic fell to 44th-ranked Czech Tomas Machac, 6-4, 0-6, 6-1, in the semi-finals in Geneva on Friday ahead of his French Open title defence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, took a wild card to the Swiss clay-court tournament in a bid to reverse an alarming dip in form ahead of Roland Garros where the 24-time Grand Slam champion has won three times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have no reaction right now, I just fought for every ball," said 23-year-old Machac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you play against Novak you just hope. You just try to play your best and see what it looks like."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, bidding to reach his first final of the season, received a medical timeout at the end of the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Serb will head to Roland Garros where he faces Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the first round having won no titles this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machac, competing in his maiden tour-level semi-final, rallied from a break down in the first set and after failing to win a game in the second powered back in the third set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm looking forward to playing in a final for the first time," said Machac who will face two-time champion Casper Ruud or Italian Flavio Cobolli in the title match on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruud, the world number seven, was the runner-up in the last two French Open finals, including a defeat to Djokovic last year. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754504_1_20240524111638.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown scored a game-high 40 points and grabbed five rebounds to lead the Boston Celtics to a 126-110 victory over the visiting Indiana Pacers on Thursday in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Brown was 14 of 27 from the floor and made 8 of 11 free throws. Boston had a 13-point lead after three quarters and the Pacers were never closer than 11 points in the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory gave Boston a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, which will shift to Indianapolis for Game 3 on Saturday. The Pacers have a 6-0 home record in the playoffs this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana point guard Tyrese Haliburton left the game in the third quarter with left leg soreness. He collected 10 points and eight assists in 28 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Siakam made 13 of 17 field-goal attempts and led the Pacers with 28 points. Andrew Nembhard added 16 points for Indiana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayson Tatum and Derrick White each scored 23 points for the Celtics. Al Horford had six points and a team-high 10 rebounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown led all first-half scorers with 24 points. Boston trailed 27-25 after one quarter but held a 57-51 halftime lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston surged in front thanks to a 20-0 run. The Celtics scored the final three points in the first quarter and the first 17 points in the second quarter to take a 42-27 lead. Indiana didn't score in the second quarter until Aaron Nesmith made two free throws with 6:45 remaining in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indiana was within two points, 68-66, after Siakam's 3-pointer with 7:55 remaining in the third, but Boston had a 93-80 advantage entering the final 12 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics' Luke Kornet left the game in the first quarter with a sprained left wrist and did not return to the court.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal was drawn to face world number four Alexander Zverev in a blockbuster opening match at his farewell French Open tournament on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadal, the record 14-time champion at Roland Garros, is unseeded this year after injury saw his ranking plummet to 276.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and Zverev met in the semi-finals of the French Open in 2022 when the German was forced to retire after suffering a serious ankle injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal, the winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, will turn 38 next week and this season will be his last on tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He holds a 7-3 winning head-to-head record against Germany's Zverev with five of those victories coming on clay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev, 27, arrives in Paris on the back of lifting the Rome Open title last weekend. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 33 points, including 15 in the fourth quarter, and the Dallas Mavericks outlasted the Minnesota Timberwolves for a 108-105 win in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals on Wednesday night in Minneapolis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyrie Irving added 30 points on 12-for-23 shooting for Dallas. Daniel Gafford [10 points, nine rebounds] and Dereck Lively II [nine points, 11 rebounds] narrowly missed double-doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaden McDaniels scored 24 points and made 6 of 9 attempts from beyond the arc to lead the Timberwolves. Anthony Edwards finished with 19 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks outscored Minnesota 26-22 in the fourth quarter to help secure the three-point win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas went on a 13-0 run to seize a 97-89 lead with 7:38 to go. Doncic started the run with seven straight points and he finished it with a pair of free throws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota responded with a 10-1 run to grab a 99-98 edge with 4:39 left. Towns hit a 3-pointer from 28 feet to put the Timberwolves on top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a timeout, Edwards made a 3-pointer to increase Minnesota's lead to 102-98 with 3:37 to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks answered with back-to-back 3-pointers by Doncic and P.J. Washington to go ahead 104-102 with 1:56 left. Doncic followed with a step-back jump shot to make it 106-102 with 49.2 seconds to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas maintained the lead the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves clung to an 83-82 advantage at the end of the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gafford threw down a pair of alley-oop dunks to start the second-half scoring for the Mavericks. Derrick Jones Jr. followed a couple minutes later with a dunk that put Dallas on top 67-66 for its first lead since the opening quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minnesota led 62-59 at halftime. McDaniels had 19 points before the break, which marked a playoff career high for him in any half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves led by eight in the final minute of the first half, but Irving scored five points in the last 22 seconds to pull Dallas within three. He finished the scoring by converting a three-point play on a basket and a free throw with 0.7 seconds left. (Reuters)

    Atalanta halt Leverkusen to win Europa League

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ademola Lookman scored a stunning hat-trick as Atalanta beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 in the Europa League final on Wednesday to win just the second major trophy in their 117-year history and end the German champions' remarkable unbeaten streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lookman, who struggled to establish himself in the English Premier League with Everton, Fulham and Leicester City before reviving his career in Italy under Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini, struck twice inside the first 26 minutes before sealing the win 15 minutes from fulltime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory ended Gasperini's own two-decade long pursuit of major silverware as his side totally outplayed Xabi Alonso's formidable Leverkusen side - or 'Neverlusen' as they had been dubbed after going an incredible 51 games unbeaten.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just as they did against Premier League heavyweights Liverpool and three-times finalists Olympique de Marseille in the previous two rounds, Atalanta didn't give their opponents a sniff to mark their first European final with a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen started the game looking decidedly unsure of themselves and some uncharacteristically sloppy play handed the first chance of the game to Gianluca Scamacca, who didn't get enough on his header from a fine Matteo Ruggeri cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an early warning shot and the purposeful Italians struck within minutes when Davide Zappacosta was allowed far too much space down the right before Lookman beat a flatfooted Exequiel Palacios to the cut back to stroke home the opener.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lookman was mobbed by his team mates and substitutes who were in dreamland 14 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Leverkusen error gifted possession to the Nigeria forward, who skipped past one defender and curled a beautiful right-footed shot into the bottom-right corner from just outside the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stunned Germans showed brief flashes of how quickly they can turn it on in attack but little came of it and it was Charles De Ketelaere who came closest on the break as Atalanta did not show a shred of debut final nerves nor any effects from the absence of injured captain Marten de Roon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen swapped defender Josip Stanisic for top scorer Victor Boniface at halftime but it changed little as both sets of travelling fans continued to create the kind of Aviva Stadium noise matched only by some of the Irish rugby teams' famous wins or memorable international soccer nights of years gone by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leverkusen had only failed to score once during the run that featured 42 wins in all competitions and 17 goals scored in or after the 90th minute, but the chances of another comeback faded away against the resolute Atalanta backline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lookman completely extinguished them on the counterattack with another stunning strike into the top corner, this time with his left foot to complete his hat-trick, the sixth in a major European final and first since Jupp Heynckes' for Borussia Moenchengladbach in the 1975 UEFA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was flung into the air by his team mates 15 minutes later when the final whistle blew and the Bergamo club ended the 61-year wait since their 1963 Italian Cup triumph. (Reuters)

 Novak Djokovic celebrated his 37th birthday on Wednesday with a much-needed win as he gears up for his French Open title defence, progressing to the Geneva quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one downed Germany's Yannick Hanfmann 6-3, 6-3 in the second round at the Parc des Eaux-Vives grounds.
