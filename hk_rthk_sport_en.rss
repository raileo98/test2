<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's world number one fencer, Vivian Kong, is another step closer to reaching the Olympic podium, after sweeping Ukraine's Olena Kryvytska 15-7 in the quarter-finals of the women's individual epee on Saturday at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong started the first round with a strong 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian was able to come back with four points, but the SAR fencing star fought back hard to finish the second period 9-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong then eased her way into the final four with six additional points in the final round to win 15-7, making this bout her best performance so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competition now moves onto the podium piste for the beginning of the semi-finals, where Kong will take on Nelli Differt, the 12th-ranked fencer from Estonia, in the semi-final at 1am Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eszter Muhari of Hungary or France's Auriane Mello-Breton await in the final later.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian Grace Brown destroyed the field to claim her country's first gold medal of the Games in the women's individual time trial, her power and bike handling abilities being unmatched by her rivals on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Several riders slid and fell on wet and cobbled corners on the 32.4-kilometre course, with defending champion Chloe Dygert ending up being the biggest casualty and having to settle for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Anna Henderson took third place, one minute 31.59 seconds behind Brown's winning time of 39 minutes 38.24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dygert hit the deck on a corner in the Bois de Vincennes, which effectively ended her chances of retaining her title and cost her second place as she ended 0.87 seconds behind Henderson. (Reuters)

    Rain causes havoc with Paris schedules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Puddles at the skateboarding arena as Saturday's events were delayed because of rain. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763452_1_20240727215944.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pouring rain in Paris on Saturday forced the men's Olympics street skateboarding competition to be postponed and tennis matches were also delayed, while athletes had mixed feelings about how to cope with the unexpectedly wet weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, a dazzling but soaked opening ceremony for the Summer Games saw thousands of athletes parade on a flotilla of barges on the Seine, at the heart of the French capital, waving to the crowd despite the downpour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese badminton player He Bingjiao laughed when she was asked if she thought the opening ceremony had been beautiful, saying she did not make it because of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately I couldn't attend because of the rain. I had to rest," she said. "It's not normal to have had a ceremony like this on the boats. I was watching it on my phone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rain continued on Saturday, forcing some events to be rescheduled and umbrellas were more in evidence than sunglasses at the beach volleyball at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The risk factor becomes too high when skateboarding in the rain," a spokesperson for World Skate said after Saturday's competition was rescheduled to Monday because La Concorde, the outdoor venue where it was supposed to take place, was drenched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening day of the tennis event was also disrupted, with thousands of spectators without tickets for the two main show courts left frustrated after negotiating lengthy queues to get in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Play began on time under the Court Philippe Chatrier roof and across the complex on Court Suzanne Lenglen. But play on the uncovered courts was delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Paris 2024 organisers said they were confident the triathlon events would take place as scheduled on Tuesday even though the rain might lead to Sunday's training session being cancelled due to concerns over the water quality in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes themselves were not that bothered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm from Oslo, so this is a perfect Norwegian summer," Inger Seim Kavlie, Norway women's double sculls rower, said with a grin as the rained poured down in the mixed zone, close to the finish line. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton stars Tse Ying-suet and Jordan Tang made a triumphant start to the Paris Olympics on Saturday, defeating their counterparts from Chinese Taipei 2-0 in their mixed doubles opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair from the SAR beat Lee Chia-hsin and Ye Hong-wei 21-13, 21-13 in their Group C game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse and Tang will next play Japan's pair of Arisa Higashino and Yuta Watanabe, whom they lost to in the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three duos are fighting for two spots in the knockout stages. A Danish pair who would've also competed in the group withdrew from the Games earlier this month after one of them had issues reporting his whereabouts in line with anti-doping regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on the badminton courts, Hong Kong's women's double pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Nga-lam suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Bulgaria's Gabriela Stoeva and Stefani Stoeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bulgarians won 21-11, 21-23 and 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong pair are next in action against the Americans Annie Xu and Kerry Xu on Monday.

 Fencing queen Vivian Kong on Saturday advanced to the quarterfinals of the women's epee individual event, after defeating the United States’ Hadley Husisian 15-12 in the group of 16 match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one ended the first round with a strong 3-1 lead. Kong then widened the gap further in the second period earning five points to bring the score to 8-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two then were locked in a back and forth contest at the start of the final round, but Kong ultimately advanced to the last eight by bringing in three more points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong had reached the quarterfinals during the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Olympic Committee apologised on Saturday for a gaffe during the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics in which South Korean athletes were incorrectly introduced as North Korean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the South Korean delegation sailed down the Seine river in the French capital, they were introduced with the official name for North Korea: "Republique populaire democratique de Coree" in French, then "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" in English.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We deeply apologise for the mistake that occurred when introducing the South Korean team during the broadcast of the opening ceremony," the IOC said in a post on its official Korean-language X account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The error sparked displeased reactions in South Korea, that is technically still at war with the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Korean Sport & Olympic Committee said later on Saturday that it had received a message from the IOC indicating that its chief, Thomas Bach, wished to directly apologise to the president of South Korea over the phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Korea's sports ministry said in a statement it "expresses regret" over the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second vice sports minister Jang Mi-ran, a 2008 Olympic weightlifting champion, has asked for a meeting with IOC chief Bach to discuss the matter, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's foreign ministry said in a statement it had contacted the French embassy in Seoul which expressed regret over what it said was an "incomprehensible mistake".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea was correctly introduced with the country's official name. (AFP)

    Ledecky edges Titmus in Olympic 400m free heats

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American great Katie Ledecky edged defending champion Ariarne Titmus to be quickest into the Olympic 400m freestyle final on Saturday, setting the scene for a titanic battle for gold.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The veteran, who was stunned by the Australian in Tokyo three years ago, touched in 4 minutes 02.19 seconds at a packed La Defense Arena ahead of an evening final on day one of the nine-day meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Racing in the same heat, Titmus went out hard and led through 300m before Ledecky came storming home to win by a fingertip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus hit the wall in 4:02.46, well outside her 3:55.38 world record as both swimmers conserved energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand rising star and current world champion Erika Fairweather was third quickest in 4:02.55, a fraction clear of Canadian Summer McIntosh, who snatched the world record last year before Titmus took it back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good to walk out to a full stadium for our prelims race," said Ledecky, who will also swim the 800m and 1500m in Paris but has dropped the 200m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It felt very similar to our Olympic trials a few weeks back, so I'm excited to see the finals atmosphere tonight as well and just happy to get a good first one under the belt."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus said the race helped "blow the cobwebs out" and denied coming second gave Ledecky any psychological advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think so. It's a heats swim," said the Australian, who broke the 200m freestyle world record and swam the second quickest 400m ever at the Australian trials last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only job for me was to get in the middle lanes [for the final] and I tried to conserve as much as I could." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong judoka Wong Ka-lee on Saturday bowed out from the Olympics, losing 10-0 to Austrian Katharina Tanzer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong was eliminated in the women’s 48-kilogramme competition by Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she was disappointed with her performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could have performed better, because I thought I had a chance after the draw. I hope I could do better next time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank [my coach and my younger brother] for encouraging me all the time... I was very nervous before the match, but they tried to help me relax."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was competing in the Games for the first time and marked the return of a Hong Kong judoka in the Olympics after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team remained in last place for most of the race, before overcoming Ireland to claim seventh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au – who's taking part in her fifth Olympics – said the team had put in "100 percent of hard work" to prepare for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On competing in the future, the swimmer said: "I just wanted to swim well this time, simply focus on doing well in the competition, and think about the rest later."

 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's fencing queen was able to skip the round of 64 because of her world number one ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The match began with a tight first period with Kong trailing by only one point, 2-3, but she was able to overcome the deficit and took control by the end of the second period with a lead of 11-8.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's shooters on Saturday claimed the first gold at the Paris Olympics, with a victory in the 10-metre air rifle mixed team event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventeen-year-old Huang Yuting and 19-year-old Sheng Lihao clinched their victory over South Koreans Keum Jihyeon and Park Hajun, outscoring their opponents 16-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair had earlier topped the qualifying round with a score of 632.2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had fielded two pairs to compete in the mixed team event, including Han Jiayu and Du Linshu, who placed eighth in the qualifying round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kazakhstan, meanwhile, won the first bronze medal in the same event after beating Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, divers Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen won the women's synchronised three-metre springboard event, kicking off China's bid to take home all eight diving gold medals at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Olympians Chang and Chen outshone their opponents in each of the five rounds, finishing with an overall score of 337.68.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair had previously won in the same event in the past three World Championships.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Saturday narrowly missed out on qualifying for the next round at the Paris Olympics, but moves on to the repechage for another chance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-time Olympian finished second-last in his men's single sculls heat, clocking a time of 7:00.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said he was satisfied with his performance, which he described as "above-average".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finishing in seven minutes is a rather good time. I had the fastest time [going into the repechage] out of all six heats, so I hope I could perform like this again in the repechage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it's a pity that I was so close yet so far, and missed the quarter-finals by one spot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who is the first SAR athlete to compete in the Paris Games, will next compete in Sunday's repechage.

<img alt="President Emmanuel Macron declares the Olympic Games open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763370_1_20240727060857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Olympic Games open on Friday after a soaking wet ceremony in which athletes were cheered by the crowd along the Seine as dancers took to the roofs of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France's three-time Olympic gold medallists Marie-Jose Perec and Teddy Riner then lit the Olympic cauldron, suspended on a hot-air balloon, before Canada's Celine Dion sang Edith Piaf's "Hymn to Love", in her first public performance in years, drawing huge cheers from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fleet of barges took the competitors on a 6 km-stretch of the river alongside some of the French capital's most famous landmarks, as performers recreated some of the sports to be showcased in the Games on floating platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time that an opening ceremony has taken place outside a stadium, adding to the headaches for a vast security operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I invite everybody: dream with us. Like the Olympic athletes, be inspired with the joy that only sport can give us. Let us celebrate this Olympic spirit of living in peace," International Olympics Committee President Thomas Bach said as the ceremony came to an end at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mix of French and international stars, including soccer great Zinedine Zidane, 14-times French Open champion Rafa Nadal, 23-times Grand Slam champion Serena Williams and three paralympic athletes were among the last torchbearers before the cauldron was lit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will blaze until the closing ceremony on August 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rain forced some fans to leave early, those who spoke to RTHK's Hailey Yip and Kelly Yu were impressed by what they saw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought it was very beautiful," one French spectator said. "Very artistic, very creative, very French, lots of contrast, lots of great pictures, so I think it was fabulous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, crowds cheered as the teams headed down the Seine on a series of barges. The Hong Kong, China team deployed umbrellas as heavy rain struck, with athletes including flag-bearers Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung snapping selfies along the way.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Athletes from the SAR and the national team got a warm welcome on the River Seine on Friday evening as the Olympic Games opening ceremony got under way in spectacular fashion in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China team, led by table tennis star Ma Long and synchronised swimmer Feng Yu, represented one of the biggest national delegations in the barge parade winding through the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rain had started to fall when Team Hong Kong, China, entered the ceremony a short time later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung carried the flag at the head of a 35-strong team. Most of the athletes carried umbrellas and many were snapping pictures as they passed the famous landmarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In accordance with tradition, Greece led the procession before the other teams came out in alphabetical order. Hosts France will enter last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other early highlights of the ceremony saw Lady Gaga sing a French cabaret song near Notre-Dame cathedral, a giant plume of blue, white and red smoke sent high above a bridge over the Seine and a winged man played accordion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lady Gaga, surrounded by dancers, sang "Mon truc en plumes" (My thing made of feathers).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Water fountains threw up jets of water in the middle of the Seine as the boats went by, with athletes waving at the crowds, amid a huge visible police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony comes just hours after a sabotage attack on the high-speed TGV rail network caused travel chaos across France and put the spotlight on the security risks at a time when all eyes are on the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show started by depicting a fictional scenario in which the arrival of the Olympic flame goes awry, ahead of the extravagant show on the river that will kick off the summer Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French soccer superstar Zinedine Zidane was shown running across Paris to bring the flame, in a pre-recorded video that included him taking it onto the metro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spectators were treated to postcard-like depictions of France and a huge cancan line performed by Moulin Rouge cabaret dancers on the banks. (RTHK/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa shocked New Zealand 14-7 on Thursday to earn an Olympic rugby sevens semi-final against France, while double-defending champions Fiji edged Ireland and will meet Australia in Saturday's medal matches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  South Africa, who qualified for the Games by winning the final repechage slot last month, went ahead with a try by Selwyn Davies, who then delivered a great kick and chase which he scooped up to gift Tristan Leyds a second try, both converted by Leyds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo silver medallists New Zealand closed the gap to 14-7 at halftime through Moses Leo and then hammered at the door throughout the second half but were kept at bay by some incredible South African defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Fiji extended their proud record of winning every match they have played at the Olympics since sevens was introduced in 2016 but they were pushed all the way by a remarkable Irish side who are relative newcomers to the format.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iosefo Baleiwairiki claimed the first Fiji try after 30 seconds but Ireland led 10-7 at halftime after two well-finished tries by Chay Mullins. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Murray withdrew from the tennis singles at the Paris Olympics on Thursday but the two-time gold medallist will play doubles in what will be the final event of his glittering career.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British former world number one, who will retire at the end of his fifth Games, has still not fully recovered from back surgery last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He believes the men's doubles, where he is playing with Dan Evans, offers his best chance of another medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've taken the decision to withdraw from the singles to concentrate on the doubles with Dan," said the 37-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our practice has been great and we're playing well together. Really looking forward to getting started and representing GB one more time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray won gold in singles at London 2012 and in Rio four years later, as well as silver in mixed doubles with Laura Robson in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His withdrawal means his final singles match was his brief second-round appearance at Queen's Club against Jordan Thompson last month before he was forced to pull out because of a spinal cyst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scot confirmed earlier this week that he would retire after the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kevin Yeung visits the Hong Kong, China delegation at the Olympic Village in Paris. Photo courtesy of Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763178_1_20240726003721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said on Thursday that Hong Kong has a good training system in place to produce new top athletes, noting that most of those representing the SAR at the Olympics this year are competing in the Games for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister made the comments after arriving at the Olympic Village to meet the Hong Kong, China delegation, adding that the athletes are quite pleased with the facilities in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said he is looking forward to cheering on the SAR squad during his time in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Having very high-standard athletes starting to emerge in our system, which I think is very important for a region like Hong Kong because we are not just looking at one or two excellent athletes,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would like to have a system that could continuously produce athletes up to the world standards. That is very encouraging to us and to everyone in Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Chef de Mission for the Hong Kong, China delegation Brian Stevenson said that the SAR team is coming in strong with many Olympic medal winners and world champions, adding that the team had no issues adjusting to the new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we're very well prepared. We had a challenge initially, of course, which was to do with the air conditioning, which everybody had. And we resolved that by bringing in our own air conditioning units. And they got in. That was resolved. So all are getting absolutely no complaints. I'm getting no complaints,” he said.

  “Some of the delegations are a bit concerned about their athletes and the food. Not from the Hong Kong delegation. And we're always checking with them as regards to the food, the environment. Everything's good.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stevenson also confirmed that the parade of athletes will take place on the River Seine by boat on July 26.

    Parisians look forward to dipping into the Seine again

<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Paris Olympics just around the corner, the French capital is a step closer to the dream of swimming in the River Seine again, as bacteria levels go down to an acceptable level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swimming in the iconic river has been banned since 1923, but athletes and Parisians may soon be able to take a dip thanks to cleanup efforts for the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Historically there's been pollution from industry, from farms upstream of Paris, and then from the city itself, from frankly raw sewage that goes into the river,” said Matthew Heberger, a Paris-based hydrologist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest water quality tests show that the river is mostly safe for swimming under standards set by international swimming and triathlon federations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the biggest risk, as Heberger explained, is "that if there's a large rainstorm in the 24 hours before one of the swimming events that could wash a lot of storm water off of the land surfaces around the city which brings with it pollution".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From July 30, the Seine is set to host outdoor swimming events during the Games. But the triathlon could be postponed or changed to a duathlon without swimming if the river water is unsafe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR triathlete Jason Ng is expecting to race in the river that day. But while he cannot guarantee that his event will go ahead, Ng said he will just focus on what he can control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would prefer the swim not to be cancelled as I've qualified for triathlon, and I would prefer to actually race the event that I've qualified for in the Olympics,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course having the swim cancelled will favour some athletes who are not as strong swimmers, but again I think you just have to deal with what comes.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip in the Seine in mid-July to convince doubters that the water is safe enough for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local surnamed Boutin told RTHK that he too wants to take a dip if all goes well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be a new future for Paris and I think it’s going to be a good thing. It was a little browner, now it’s greenish. There’s a colour change,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And another Parisian, Kelfa, said he hopes the river will stay clean so people can swim even after the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I do believe the numbers of the studies, like they’ve been saying recently it was too high of bacteria for us to swim in it, which I do believe,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And now apparently they’ve invested a lot to clean it and the numbers are better. I guess we should trust them.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's legendary table tennis player Ma Long and artistic swimmer Feng Yu will carry China's flag at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games opening ceremony on Friday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma, who has claimed three team golds and two singles titles in previous Olympic Games, will be making his fourth Olympic appearance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having led China's artistic swimming team to a silver medal at Tokyo 2020, the 24-year-old Feng looks to dream bigger in Paris. China has made steady progress in artistic swimming in recent years, sealing golds in all five Olympic routines at the World Championships in Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two candidates reflect our recognition of veteran athletes who persist in their careers, as well as the encouragement to the rising events and youngsters," said Zhang Xin, the secretary-general of the Chinese Olympic delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, China has announced a delegation of 716 members, including 405 athletes, for the Paris Olympic Games. 136 male and 269 female athletes will compete in 236 events across 30 sports at the July 26 to August 11 Games. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to France said the Paris Olympics will further boost sports and cultural cooperation between the two countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK in Paris, Lu Shaye said China and France can leverage the Games and work together in sharing sports resources and training young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On one hand, China and France can strengthen cooperation on sharing resources on sports where each country excels, like table tennis and diving for China and football and fencing for France,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On the other hand, we can also promote sports education cooperation, encouraging Chinese and French primary and secondary school students to go to each other's country to join summer and winter sports camps.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu also said themed exhibitions will be held at the China House in Paris during the Olympic Games to showcase Chinese cultural traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France. Lu said talks between President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in May brought relations to new heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The two sides issued a total of four joint statements, on the situation in the Middle East, artificial intelligence, global governance and biodiversity... Nearly 20 bilateral cooperation documents were signed. The China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has been further consolidated and deepened,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The envoy added that Hong Kong plays an important role in promoting people-to-people exchanges between China and France.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Salt Lake City was formally awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics and Paralympics following a vote on Wednesday by the International Olympic Committee in Paris, giving the US state of Utah its second Games after hosting in 2002.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About a thousand sports fans gathered in downtown Salt Lake City in ski gear in the summer heat, while others donned Team USA merchandise and waved flags with the Olympic rings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd erupted in cheers as Olympic officials made their final decision to return to a city where they said the local enthusiasm was palpable even two decades after it first hosted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Utah's capital city was the only candidate for 2034 after the Olympic committee gave Salt Lake City exclusive negotiating rights last year. Climate change and high operational costs have reduced the number of cities willing and able to welcome the Winter Games. (AP)

 Men's tennis number one Jannik Sinner withdrew from the Paris Olympics on Wednesday, days before it begins, after falling ill with tonsillitis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian said he was "sad and disappointed" to drop out, adding that he had started feeling unwell on Monday after a practice week in Monaco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After seeing my doctors on Tuesday and waiting an extra day to give myself some more time to see if my condition would improve, things unfortunately got worse," Sinner, 22, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was looking forward to competing with my teammates and the rest of the Italian team, but for now that will have to wait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As advised by my medical team, I will now take some time to rest and recover to full health. I'd like to wish the whole team Italia the best for this important event and hope to be back stronger in the future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner said the Olympics had been "one of my main goals for this season" and was due to play in the men's singles and the doubles with Lorenzo Musetti. (AFP)

    Fan invasion chaos mars Morocco win against Argentina

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Morroco fans threw water bottles on to the pitch after Argentina scored their second goal. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763020_2_20240725081807.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chaos and confusion reigned on Wednesday as Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in their opening game of the men's Olympic football tournament, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Argentina thought they had escaped from the Group B match in Saint-Etienne with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was completely unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium by now emptied of spectators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a VAR review, and Morocco held on for all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an undignified start to the sporting action at the Paris Games, and a bad day all round for Argentina, whose players were booed as they emerged onto the pitch and during the national anthem by the crowd, most of whom were supporting Morocco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That welcome came after Argentina players were filmed singing racist chants following their victory in the recent Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a circus," complained Argentina coach Javier Mascherano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At no point did they tell us our goal was not valid... this would not even happen in a neighbourhood tournament. It's pathetic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beyond the Olympic spirit, the organisation needs to be up to standard. At the moment it is not, unfortunately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina are looking to win men's football gold for the third time after success in 2004 and 2008, but Mascherano's side trailed 2-0 following a brace by Soufiane Rahimi. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Loganimasi Ponipate of Fiji scores in the Rugby Sevens men’s Pool C match between Fiji and Uruguay at Stade de France. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763019_1_20240725001123.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France struggled to live up to pre-tournament billing as favourites for Olympic Gold in rugby sevens on Wednesday, held to a 12-12 draw by the United States to the disappointment of a packed Stade de France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, double Olympic champions Fiji burnished their own title credentials, swatting aside Uruguay 40-12 with typical Fijian flair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Les Bleus side featuring Antoine Dupont, arguably the world's greatest 15-a-side player, were left to rue several errors in possession that opened the door for their lesser-ranked opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France opened their account halfway through the first half, a brilliant offload out of contact releasing Jordan Sepho for a try in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the home crowd was stunned into silence just before the half-time whistle as US flyer Lucas Lacamp broke through the French defence for a long-range effort that earned his team a 7-5 lead at the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France restored their advantage practically from the kick-off in the second half, Rayan Rebbadj powering over after a move that started with a clever Dupont offload.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a powerful American counter-ruck after France were caught isolated deep in their half allowed Marcus Tupuola to stroll in for a try that secured them a deserved draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We lacked precision, especially close to the try line. We were knocked back a lot, especially at the start of the match," said France captain Paulin Riva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We didn't manage to finish, messed up every time we should have finished," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result blows open pool C, which also features Fiji, always a force in sevens despite a disappointing season by their standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With trademark free-flowing rugby, the Fijians had far too much pace and power for Uruguay, a Joji Nasova first-half double killing off the match as a contest before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Americans put up a spirited effort, however, with two tries of their own but were no match for Fiji who laid down an impressive marker to the rest of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Australia squeezed past a determined Samoa side 21-14, courtesy of a Henry Hutchison double to get their pool B campaign off to a winning start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other pool B match saw Argentina roundly booed by the home faithful before running out comfortable 31-12 winners against Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France were billed as the team to beat in the men's competition, with superstar Dupont one of the pin-ups of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fiji have won both Olympic Golds since the sport was introduced at the Rio Games in 2016 and showed they will be no pushover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fiji and France will face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what is a wide-open tournament for the men, stiff competition will also likely come from traditional rugby powers New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the global exposure that comes with the Olympics and playing to a sold-out Stade de France, World Rugby's chief executive Alan Gilpin has described the tournament as a "coming of age" moment for the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has never been a greater spotlight on the sport," Gilpin said ahead of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's tournament starts on Sunday, with Australia and New Zealand well-placed to battle for the gold. (AFP)

    Security beefed up in Paris ahead of Olympics

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Paris Olympics are just around the corner and authorities in France are not taking any chances on security, as the national terrorist alert remains at the highest level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police from France and dozens of other countries, alongside local security personnel, have been deployed to patrol major landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Élysées in the days leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the Olympic opening ceremony will be held outdoors, with about 300,000 spectators expected to gather along the Seine River for the spectacular show on Friday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of their arrangements, French authorities have set up security perimetres, known as “grey zones”, near the river, and tourists will need to apply for a QR code in advance for entry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The police presence around the Olympic venues and events is very strong, and implementations of the red and grey zones to block of pedestrians and vehicle traffic as they see fit. I guess they are good, even though I can’t really walk the Seine right now because I don’t have a grey pass,” American tourist Mitchell Hasenpflug told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Takehiro Kinoshita, who travelled with his family from Japan to watch the skateboarding event, said he was surprised to see how clean and prepared the city is for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel all the time safe 'cause you see all the police around the corner, and it’s amazing so I cannot complain,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not everyone's amused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local resident, Dominique, said traffic is getting worse with restricted zones and an influx of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s terrible, but we didn’t have the choice either… but no, of course you have inconvenience for these Olympic Games.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some businesses located in the sealed-off areas said they too are feeling the pinch, complaining about fewer customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some also said they are closing for a few days until after the opening ceremony on July 26.

 Polish high jumper Norbert Kobielski has been provisionally suspended for doping just days before the Paris Olympics, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old, who has a personal best of 2.33 metres, finished 10th at last year's world championships in Budapest and sixth at the European championships in Rome last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kobielski has left the Polish Olympic delegation in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AIU said he had tested positive for the banned "pentedrone norephedrine metabolite".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening ceremony for the 2024 Olympics takes place on Friday along the river Seine, although the men's high jump qualifying will not be held until August 7, with the final three days later. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British dressage star Charlotte Dujardin withdrew from the Paris Olympics on Tuesday after a video emerged allegedly showing her mistreating a horse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dujardin, a three-time Olympic champion and the joint most-decorated British woman Olympian, said she had made an "error of judgement" and expressed deep remorse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) suspended her with immediate effect, just days before the start of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governing body said it had received a video "depicting Ms Dujardin engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This video was submitted to the FEI by a lawyer representing an undisclosed complainant," the FEI added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information received, the footage was allegedly taken several years ago during a training session conducted by Ms Dujardin at a private stable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FEI said Dujardin had confirmed she was depicted in the video and had acknowledged that her conduct was "inappropriate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said she had asked to be provisionally suspended pending the outcome of the investigations and voluntarily withdrew from the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

    Sporting bodies take Fifa to EU watchdog

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Football's world governing body has been accused of taking "unilateral decisions" and of conduct that "infringes EU competition law and notably constitutes an abuse of dominance". File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762874_1_20240724014908.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two major bodies representing footballers and football clubs in Europe are filing a complaint to the European Commission accusing FIFA of abusing its position.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Football's world governing body has taken "unilateral decisions" and its conduct "infringes EU competition law and notably constitutes an abuse of dominance", FIFPro Europe and the European Leagues body said in a statement on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFPro is the global players' union while European Leagues brings together more than one thousand clubs from 33 countries around Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say FIFA's conduct with regards to the international match calendar has "harmed the economic interests of national leagues and the welfare of players" and argue FIFA's role as a regulator and competition organiser is a conflict of interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA has been accused of a failure to consult over recent changes to the calendar, such as the introduction of a 32-team Club World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first edition of the expanded Club World Cup is set to take place in the United States in June and July next year and 12 European clubs are due to feature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of the continent's leading players will therefore be obliged to participate at a time when they would otherwise have been afforded a long close-season break, a year ahead of the expanded 48-team World Cup in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The international match calendar is now beyond saturation and has become unsustainable for national leagues and a risk for the health of players," FIFPro and European Leagues said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "FIFA's decisions over the last years have repeatedly favoured its own competitions and commercial interests, neglected its responsibilities as a governing body, and harmed the economic interests of national leagues and the welfare of players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "National leagues and player unions, which represent the interests of all clubs and all players at the national level, and regulate labour relations through collectively agreed solutions, cannot accept that global regulations are decided unilaterally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Legal action is now the only responsible step for European leagues and player unions to protect football, its ecosystem and its workforce from FIFA's unilateral decisions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement refers to the Super League judgement from the European Court of Justice last December, which required FIFA and other governing bodies to exercise their regulatory functions in a way that is transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA's conduct over the calendar, they allege, "falls well short of these requirements".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain's La Liga, which is not a member of European Leagues, has also joined the complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes after England's Professional Footballers' Association and their French counterparts, the UNFP, launched an action in the Belgian courts in June to ultimately determine whether FIFA's actions had breached players' rights under European Union law. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) on Tuesday said 45 air-conditioners had been delivered to the Olympic village in Paris for SAR athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SF&OC said the move was made after coordination by the SAR government and the liaison office, as well as communication with the organising committee of the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation is one of several that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the government announced that culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung will fly to Paris on Thursday to attend events at the Games and cheer for Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his stay, Yeung will meet with the SAR delegation in the Olympic village and watch competitions featuring Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will return to Hong Kong on July 31.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Briton Andy Murray, the first male tennis player to claim two Olympic singles gold medals, says he will play the final event of his career at the Paris Games before heading into retirement. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762823_1_20240723172540.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world number one and three-time Grand Slam title winner Andy Murray confirmed on Tuesday that he would retire after the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Arrived in Paris for my last ever tennis tournament @Olympics. Competing for Great Britain have been by far the most memorable weeks of my career and I'm extremely proud to get do it one final time," the 37-year-old wrote on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now ranked at 121, and playing with a metal hip since 2019, Murray suffered ankle damage this year and underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his spine which ruled him out of the singles tournament at Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead, he played doubles with brother Jamie and was defeated in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray famously ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's champion at Wimbledon when he triumphed in 2013, defeating career-long rival Novak Djokovic in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added a second title in 2016, taking his career majors total to three after breaking his duck at the 2012 US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray won gold at the 2012 Olympics on an emotional day at the All England Club where he defeated Roger Federer just weeks after he had lost the Wimbledon final to the Swiss on the same Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four years later, he defeated Juan Martin del Potro to become the first player, male or female, to win two Olympic singles golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray also led Britain to the Davis Cup in 2015, the country's first in 79 years. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning Olympic silver medalist Marketa Vondrousova withdrew from the Paris Summer Games on Monday due to a hand injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2023 Wimbledon champion from the Czech Republic lost to Switerland's Belinda Bencic in the gold medal match at the Tokyo Olympics in July 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova had been planning to play singles as well as doubles with Karolina Muchova. The tennis competition at Roland Garros begins on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was hoping until the last moment that I could go at least in doubles, but problems with my hand won't let me on the court," Vondrousova posted on Instagram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kateřina Siniaková, who won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in doubles and is a nine-time Grand Slam champion in women's doubles, will replace Vondrousova in the women's singles tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova, 25, said her focus now shifts to getting healthy in time for next month's U.S. Open, the final grand slam on the 2024 calendar. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing champion Edgar Cheung and double swimming silver medallist Siobhan Haughey have been named as the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China team at the Olympic opening ceremony later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR Athletes will join thousands of other competitors in a unique ceremony taking place on the River Seine in Paris, and winding past some of the most famous landmarks in the French capital on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of their departure to Paris, the Chef de Mission of the SAR delegation, Brian Stevenson, called on Hongkongers to back the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look to the athletes to perform their best, and of course the best for each athlete differs, but I'm talking about their personal best. If they can achieve that, you cannot ask for more than that, other than that bit better than even their best," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll be satisfied if all the athletes have given their very best performance and we know their records and what they can achieve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who was the city's flag bearer at the Tokyo Olympics, becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to be picked for the honour in successive Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stevenson also confirmed air-conditioners will arrive at the Olympic village on Tuesday, admitting the units were arriving later than scheduled because of security reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is one of a number of delegations that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.

<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James, the NBA's all-time leading points scorer, will be the male flagbearer for Team USA at the Paris Olympics, US Olympic officials announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  James, 39, was picked by his fellow US Olympians for Friday's ceremony on the River Seine. The female flagbearer will be announced on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an incredible honour to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together," Los Angeles Lakers power forward James said in a statement from the USOPC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I'm proud to be a part of this important moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony on the Seine will be the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>

 Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth will be the first Hong Kong sailors racing in Olympic 49er competitions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 49er is a two-handed skiff-type high-performance sailing dinghy, which requires the two crew members to work on different roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo told RTHK about their strong bond, which started in 2018 when they paired up.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Arthur Fils came out on top after a gruelling three-set encounter with Alexander Zverev to win the Hamburg Open on Sunday, defeating the hometown player 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/1).
 <br>
  <br/>
  After victory in Lyon last year, it is the 20-year-old's second ATP title as he confirms his position as one of the sport's leading next-gen players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 28 Fils overcame German top seed Zverev on the clay in Hamburg after just over three-and-a-half hours on court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew from the start it was not going to be easy. First set I was taking care of it, I think I had a little but of luck, but playing great. Then second set he managed to play better than me and to raise his level," said Fils during the trophy ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we closed the roof I knew it was going to be just a fight, like a dogfight. You just have to fight until the last point, until the last ball. I've practising for a long time for this kind of moment so I'm really happy to win it." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele said a "sense of calm" helped him win the British Open on Sunday as the American claimed his second major just two months after triumphing at the PGA Championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old Californian delivered a faultless, zen-like six-under-par final round at Royal Troon to emerge from a congested leaderboard and clinch the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele finished on nine-under par for the championship, two shots ahead of England's Justin Rose and Billy Horschel of the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele, who registered a major record of 21-under-par to win the PGA at Valhalla in May, is the first player to win two majors in a year since Brooks Koepka in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His victory on the west coast of Scotland completes an American clean sweep of the game's biggest titles in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought (winning the PGA) would help me and it actually did. I had this sense of calm, a calm I didn't have when I played earlier at the PGA," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was telling my caddie Austin (Kaiser) that I felt pretty calm coming down the stretch and he said he was about to puke on the 18th tee."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just told myself to just hit it down there and keep moving along," added the world number three, who described clinching the Open as a "dream come true". (AFP)

    Team orders hand Piastri maiden F1 victory in Hungary

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri said he realised a childhood dream on Sunday after claiming his maiden Formula One victory in a whirlpool of mixed emotions and vexed team orders as McLaren claimed an emphatic one-two at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After taking the lead at the start, when he passed pole-sitting team-mate Lando Norris, the 23-year-old Australian pulled clear to control the race until losing out in the pit-stops, when the Briton gained an advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren pitted him first for an 'undercut' to fend off seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes who finished third after surviving a skirmish with Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This resulted in Norris, who had superior pace, inheriting the lead, leading into the closing laps and receiving repeated orders to give back his position – and victory – to Piastri, who was struggling to close the gap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After prolonged strained dialogue on the team radio, Norris agreed to slow down and let Piastri pass him with three laps remaining, despite knowing he was losing a chance to cut substantially into Max Verstappen's lead in the drivers' championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A very special day for me," said Piastri. "This is the day I've dreamed of as a kid, to be standing on the top step of an F1 podium. A bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he was unfazed by the team orders arguments played out over the closing laps as McLaren asked Norris to slow down, preserve his tyres and allow Piastri to catch and pass him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer you leave it, of course, you get a bit nervous, but it was well-executed by the team and it was the right thing to do. I had put myself in the right position at the start," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the different strategies we had, my pace probably wasn't as quick as I would have liked in the last stint, but I was still in the right position to make it happen." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafa Nadal gets a hug from Nuno Borges after his defeat in the Bastad Open final. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762566_1_20240721222405.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal lost his first final in two years on Sunday as the Spaniard went down 6-3, 6-2 to Portugal's Nuno Borges at the clay-court Bastad Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish tennis great had shown signs of a return to form in Scandinavia as he made an impressive run to the final, just one week before tennis at the Olympic Games gets under way on the clay in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nadal, rather than celebrating his 64th title on the surface and first since Roland Garros 2022, was dominated by Borges as he struggled to find fluency with his serve and ground strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know what to say. I think I was wishing for this moment for a while already," said Borges in his post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's crazy, in tennis it doesn't happen when you expect it sometimes. I know we all wanted Rafa to win, a part of me wished that too, but something even bigger inside of me really pushed through today... I'm just really happy overall. I really don't know what to say, I'm very emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borges was the first to make headway in the match when he broke the Spaniard's serve to go 3-1 up, with Nadal saving break points before overcooking a forehand down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 14-time French Open winner struck back immediately on the Borges serve, earning two break-back points before the Portuguese dumped a forehand into the net from inside the service box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But neither player could quite grab the ascendancy in the first set as Borges quickly ran up a 0-40 lead in the next service game, converting his second break point with a perfectly executed drop shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal was struggling to find his first serve but managed to hold just his second service game of the opening set to force Borges to serve one more time. The world number 51 kept his nerve to do just that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old showed signs of his old self serving at deuce in the first game of the second set with a booming forehand winner down the line, before he eventually held but that was one of the few highlights for Nadal on the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borges then struck at 2-2 as he broke Nadal's serve for the first time in the second set and fourth time overall to edge ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old followed it up by winning the next three games, sealing a maiden career title in his first-ever match-up against the former world number one with an ace. (AFP)

    Guidelines not meant to find faults: sports bosses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New guidelines on the corporate governance of sports associations are expected to be unveiled in mid-September, Hong Kong's sports bosses said on Sunday, stressing they were not trying to pinpoint any shortcomings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China has been conducting a review of the corporate governance of national sports associations in the SAR following an audit report in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary-general of the federation, said the sports governing body had submitted a plan to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not about fault-finding, picking out what is wrong. We always look at our national sports associations as our affiliates. They need our support, and what is right should stay, what is wrong should be changed. We need to keep up with the times. Times have changed and what's appropriate in the past may not be nowadays," Yang told a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[By doing so,] we hope the selection of athletes can meet our current requirements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Kenneth Fok said it's important for the sports governing body to conduct a "health check".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he urged people not to question the governance of the entire sports sector based on isolated incidents, saying that a majority of associations and organisations under the governing body had been able to promote sports development professionally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the upcoming Paris Olympics, Fok, who is also the federation's vice-president, said he believed there would not be blunders involving the national anthem at the Games as there were procedures in place to ensure the correct song was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe there will not be any mistakes at the Olympics, because it is the most sought-after event around the world. The organising committee would arrange for us to verify the national anthem and flags, and the whole process would require signatures," Fok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have to tell our athletes that some audience members are very enthusiastic and they will bring regional and national flags to the venues. But sometimes, they may have the wrong versions. So we have urged athletes not to take the flags given to them, because it would become their responsibility once they take the flags."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending 35 athletes to Paris, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fok called on the public to support them regardless of whether they win a medal or not, saying he was confident in the athletes' performance at the Games.

    Horschel leads Open one shot ahead of chasing pack

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Billy Horschel goes into the final day at Royal Troon just one shot in front.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American Billy Horschel leads the British Open at four under par heading into Sunday's final round after torrential rain and a swirling wind at Royal Troon blew the challenge for the Claret Jug wide open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Horschel leads by one from a group of six, featuring USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, South Africa's Thriston Lawrence and Americans Sam Burns and Russell Henley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler is just one shot further back at two under after battling to an even par round of 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 12 players are within four shots of the lead for what promises to be a fascinating final round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight leader Shane Lowry had a day to forget as the 2019 champion crumbled in the sodden conditions to collapse from eight under par after seven holes to one under by the end of his round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Horschel was one of the big movers in a round that had allowed for lower scoring earlier in the day before the wind and rain picked up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting at two under, Horschel produced a sublime four-under 32 on the front nine thanks to birdies at four, six, seven and nine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bogey followed at 11 before another dropped shot at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown, ranked 272 in the world, had been set to lead heading into the final round until a double bogey at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he and Rose remain in the hunt to become the first English winner since Nick Faldo in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry began the day with a two-shot lead and extended that to three with a birdie at the par-five fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Irishman's round began to come off the rails with a double bogey at the 130-yard Postage Stamp eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worse was to come as five bogeys in eight holes on the back nine dropped Lowry back into ninth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fresh from his maiden major win at the USPGA, Schauffele is eyeing another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three moved to five under at one stage before bogeys at 11 and 18 knocked him back to three under after a round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll let myself dream tonight," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler is also right in the mix to win his third major and win for a seventh time in 15 starts this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A birdie at the third got the American off to a fine start but he then played the next 13 holes in two over before picking up a shot at the 17th to remain ominously poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The back nine, I think that was probably the hardest nine holes that I'll ever play," said Scheffler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence, Burns and Henley made the most of the benign early morning conditions to shoot through the pack to three under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence and Burns posted six-under 65s, while Henley made 66 to move into contention before the leaders had to face the worst of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time major champion Justin Thomas and former Masters winner Adam Scott also impressed to move to level par and remain on the fringes of the battle for the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the challenge from the big names on the breakaway Liv circuit failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jon Rahm slipped back to two over, while Brooks Koepka is back at eight over after a 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the loudest cheers of the week so far was reserved for Kim Si-woo after he produced the longest hole-in-one in British Open history on the 17th that brought him back to five over for the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was not doing very well, and then I was feeling terrible for my shots the last couple days. Then finally I got the best golf shot I've ever had this week," said the South Korean. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal reached his first final since winning the 2022 French Open, defeating Croatian qualifier Duje Ajdukovic in a three-set tussle in Bastad on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A day after his four-hour quarter-final victory, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was again tested to the limit by Ajdukovic, the world number 130 who had won just two tour-level matches before this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard rebounded from dropping the opening set to prevail 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, returning to the final of a tournament he won as a teenager in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will play Portuguese seventh seed Nuno Borges or Argentina's Thiago Agustin Tirante on Sunday as he goes in search of the 93rd singles title of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most recent triumph came two years ago at Roland Garros, when he won the tournament for a record-extending 14th time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal is using the event in Bastad as a tune-up for the Paris Olympics, where the tennis will be played on the clay at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old returned to action this week for the first time since losing in the first round of the French Open in late May. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762491_1_20240721013834.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall leader Tadej Pogacar won for a fifth time on this Tour de France on Saturday, moving to the brink of a third title, as defending champion Jonas Vingegaard came second and Remco Evenepoel dropped around a minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just Sunday's concluding time trial to come, two-time champion Pogacar has a five minute 14-second lead over Vingegaard as he effectively made sure of becoming the first man in 26 years to capture the Giro d'Italia-Tour de France double in the same season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day's action culminated on the tough Col de Couillole climb where Evenepoel attacked Vingegaard in an attempt to take second place overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead he himself dropped around 53sec on the Dane, making it less likely the Belgian can claim second place after Sunday's time trial, where he is favourite for the stage win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel did however virtually guarantee third place overall and the white jersey as best young rider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic champion Richard Carapaz, regarded as the most combative rider on the 2024 Tour, will win the climb points jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carapaz came third on Saturday, won a stage and even took the yellow jersey for a day early in the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 3,498km on this 2024 Tour there remains just 34, a challenging run along the narrow, undulating corniche between the principality of Monaco, where many in the peloton live, and the French Riviera town of Nice. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris claimed pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday ahead of Oscar Piastri as McLaren celebrated their first front row lock-out in over a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen took third in qualifying to start Sunday's race on the second row with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz for company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's under pressure teammate Sergio Perez crashed out in the first session, triggering a red flag and increasing pressure on his job as the Dutch driver's number two at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Ricciardo, a former winner at the circuit, produced a late flash of speed once Q1 resumed to top the times in his RB from Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes with the seven-time champion's teammate George Russell the big name absentee from Q2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris led the pack into the top-10 shoot out, with Hamilton, who broke his lengthy winless run at Silverstone last time out, sneaking through with the slowest time of the middle leg of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuki Tsunoda ended up in a wall in his RB, forcing a second red flag with just two minutes left and Norris and Piastri provisionally locking out the front row for McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen had to sit out the conclusion of qualifying when it resumed after Tsunoda's stricken RB was removed due to an issue with his car as McLaren sealed the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton is on the third row after the fifth fastest time ahead of Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari, Aston Martin duo Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll, with Ricciardo and Tsunoda completing the top 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen leads Norris by 84 points going into Sunday's race at the Hungaroring. (AFP)

    Former world snooker champion Reardon dies aged 91

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ray Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762471_1_20240720202754.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world champion Ray Reardon, the coal miner who dominated snooker in the 1970s, has died at the age of 91.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Welshman Reardon had previously been diagnosed with cancer and passed away on Friday night, his wife Carol confirmed on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ray Reardon, widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever and a six-time world champion, has died at the age of 91," a World Snooker Tour statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jimmy White, one of snooker's most popular players, said on X: "Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978, earning an MBE in the 1985 Queen's Birthday honours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed 'Dracula' after playing a session of the 1974 World Championship final in a cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket, Reardon rose to prominence as snooker became a popular sport in Britain thanks to the Pot Black television programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most," Reardon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He battled the flamboyant Alex Higgins in a long-running rivalry with the "Hurricane" that included an epic 18-15 defeat in the 1982 World Championship final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former world number one worked as a coal miner and was also a police officer for eight years before taking snooker by storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was fortunate to survive a mining accident when a 12-foot girder and a deluge of rubble crashed down on him while he was building a pit lane, leaving him trapped for three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right," he wrote in his autobiography.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon retired in 1991 at the age of 58 but remained in the snooker world, helping Ronnie O'Sullivan as a consultant during his run to the 2004 world title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Welsh Open trophy was named in Reardon's honour in 2016. (AFP)

    Lowry takes Open lead as McIlroy, Woods miss cut

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Irishman Shane Lowry heads into the weekend at Troon two shots ahead. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762385_1_20240720052225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday, as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among the star names to miss the cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Only 10 of the 154 players left in the field are under par as the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast wreaked havoc, with five of the world's top 10 failing to make the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry leads by two from Justin Rose, who came through qualifying to book his place in Troon, and unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown on his major debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here," said Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also well in the running at one under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy's decade-long wait for a major will extend into 2025 at least after a disastrous two days to finish on 11 over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two needed an under par round after shooting 78 on Thursday but carded a triple bogey eight at the fourth in a run of six dropped shots in four holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That four-hole stretch to start off is what cost me," said the Northern Irishman. "Twenty-two holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods was one of the few players to finish below McIlroy on 14 over after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time British Open champion's score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and was his poorest at this event by three shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg, Wyndham Clark and Viktor Hovland were the other top-10 players to miss the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were joined by 2022 champion Cam Smith, Tommy Fleetwood and Sahith Theegala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre bounced back from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to sneak into the weekend at five over. (AFP)

    Japan gymnast Miyata pulled from Olympics for smoking

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Teenage gymnast Shoko Miyata has been pulled from Japan's team for the Paris Olympics after being caught smoking and drinking, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old, a world bronze medallist and captain of Japan's women's gymnastics team for the Games, was sent home from their training camp in Monaco after admitting she had violated their code of conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With her confirmation and after discussions on all sides, it has been decided that she will withdraw from the Olympics," Japan Gymnastics Association (JGA) secretary general Kenji Nishimura told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said the association had been told that Miyata was seen smoking in a private setting in Tokyo some time at the end of June or beginning of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also reportedly drank alcohol in a room at Japan's national training centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoking and drinking are both illegal under the age of 20 in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said it was not clear whether Miyata was at a party or drinking alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being a member of the Japan national gymnastics team is a position where you have high demands on you all the time," said JGA chairman Tadashi Fujita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fujita said that Miyata was already back in Japan after leaving the team's camp and that the JGA would give her support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miyata won bronze in the balance beam at the 2022 world championships in Liverpool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the all-around title at Japan's national championships earlier this year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tadej Pogacar climbed to a convincing victory on stage 19 of the Tour de France on Friday, extending his overall lead over defending champion Jonas Vingegaard to close on a historic Tour-Giro double.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With two tough stages remaining, the 2020 and 2021 Tour de France champion Pogacar leads Vingegaard by 5min 3sec while Remco Evenepoel remains third, now at 7min 1sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar is also two stages away from a Giro d'Italia and Tour de France double, which would be a first since 1998.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A dominant and confident Pogacar promised to attack here on the 'Queen' stage with its massive mountains and came into stage 19 with a 3min 11sec lead over Vingegaard, with Evenepoel at 5min 11sec in third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous weak moments for the Team UAE rider have come at altitude and in hot weather, as he let slip the last two Tour de France titles to the Dane Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So the 25-year-old will have been happy riding under overcast skies as the mercury dipped to 18.5 Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was plenty of altitude on the menu however as the pack first crossed the fan-packed Col de la Bonette, a 23km climb at 7 percent average gradient to the dizzying altitude of 2,800m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final climb to Isola 2000 ski resort is hardly less crushing and Pogacar attacked with a jaw-dropping 10km to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left his rivals trailing in his wake and chewed up the attackers one by one in quick succession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matteo Jorgenson was second on the day at 21sec, while Simon Yates had led much of the way but dropped to third at 40sec after Pogacar passed him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Carapaz was fourth at 1min 11sec and Evenepoel fifth with Vingegaard on his wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eritrean break-out star Biniam Girmay retained the green sprint jersey ahead of Jasper Philipsen as the escape group took the intermediate sprint points way ahead of the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay and Philipsen have both won three stages on this year's race, while Pogacar has four. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal continued his Olympic preparations with a confident 6-4, 6-4 win over Cameron Norrie at the Bastad Open on Thursday, showing signs of the power hitting that fired him to 14 French Open titles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old Spaniard continued his return to winning ways on the Swedish clay as he moved into the quarter-finals, racking up his ninth Tour win of the year and back-to-back wins for the first time since reaching the last-16 of the Madrid Open in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Great feelings now, I've been a while now without playing on the Tour since Roland Garros and had the chance to compete well against a great player like Cameron," said Nadal during his on-court interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I played, for moments, good tennis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal now leads the former world number eight Briton 5-1 in their head-to-head record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam champion was unstoppable as he ground his opponent down with powerful, topspin-heavy ground strokes. He broke Norrie again and served out to love, having won five games in a row to take the match in straight sets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian Victor Campenaerts wept with joy after winning stage 18 of the Tour de France as overall leader Tadej Pogacar and defending champion Jonas Vingegaard saved their thunder for a trilogy of harsh stages over the final weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pogacar and Vingegaard were relaxed as the escape pulled 15 minutes clear, the pair content to hold fire as the 2024 Tour reaches its climax in Nice on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow and Saturday," Pogacar said at the line, shaking his head as if the names of the day's themselves explained the massive challenge ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we enjoyed today with the team, what a wonderful journey," said the 2020 and 2021 champion who came second on the last two Tours to Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Slovenian is three days away from a cycling landmark as he won the Giro d'Italia in May and will become the first rider in 25-years to complete the double if he holds on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar retained a 3min 11sec lead on Vingegaard as the peloton rolled gently over the finish line 13min 41sec after the winner, while rookie Remco Evenepoel is third at 5min 09sec. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Marseille have signed striker Mason Greenwood from Manchester United, the Ligue 1 side announced on Thursday, despite the objection of some of the French club's fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old, who has played once for England, was suspended in January 2022 by Manchester United following allegations of attempted rape and sexual assault but prosecutors dropped charges in February 2023. He spent last season on loan at Getafe in La Liga.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Olympique de Marseille are delighted to announce the signing of Mason Greenwood from Manchester United. The 22-year-old striker has signed for the club following a successful medical," said the French club on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marseille made no mention of the allegations in their statement. They called Greenwood "a precocious talent" and an "English nugget".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The southern club, eighth in Ligue 1 last season, said their new striker will wear the number 10 shirt but did not specify the length of his contract or mention any fee to Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the deal is reported to be worth an estimated 30 million euros (US$32.7 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We wish Mason all the best in his future career," said United on their website. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Vieira stood down as manager of Strasbourg, the Ligue 1 club confirmed on Thursday, as his name was linked to the vacant United States men's team coaching job.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vieira, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, joined Strasbourg last season and is leaving "by mutual agreement," the French club said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, 48, coached New York City in the MLS between 2016-2018 and, according to widespread reports, could be returning to the US to succeed Gregg Berhalter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berhalter was axed as United States coach following their first-round exit in the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira was asked about the States job last week after Strasbourg lost 4-0 to Turkish giants Fernebahce in a pre-season friendly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States? Ah no, my focus is 100% in Alsace (Strasbourg)" he told a local newspaper in the north eastern region of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, who was under contract with Strasbourg until 2026, ended last season with his club in 13th place in Ligue 1. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Justin Thomas made a strong start at the 152nd Open but then hit trouble as rain squalls kept a grip on the early scoring at Royal Troon in Scotland on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Alex Noren was the early clubhouse leader with a birdie on the 18th giving him a two-under-par 69, but Thomas initially looked like eclipsing that mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former PGA Championship winner gathered four birdies with one bogey on his outward nine and then birdied the 10th to top the early leader board on four under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a double-bogey six at the 12th and a bogey on the 13th dropped him back into the pack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow American Bryson DeChambeau, last month's US Open champion, started in the company of young Swede Ludvig Aberg, who is ranked fourth in the world, but the big-hitting DeChambeau suffered a terrible start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was five over after his first six holes and in danger of playing himself out of contention on day one. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into racist chants by Argentina players after they won the Copa America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "FIFA is aware of a video circulating on social media and the incident is being looked into," a spokesperson for world football's governing body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added: "FIFA strongly condemns any form of discrimination by anyone including players, fans and officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chants were heard during a live video posted on social media by Chelsea and Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez from the team bus in the wake of the Copa victory over Colombia in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some players, including 23-year-old Fernandez, sing a chant dating back to the 2022 World Cup final in which Argentina beat France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The song targets France's star striker Kylian Mbappe among others and includes racist and homophobic insults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea had earlier announced they had launched an internal disciplinary procedure against Fernandez over the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez has apologised and the club said in a statement it had launched an "internal disciplinary procedure".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chelsea Football Club finds all forms of discriminatory behaviour completely unacceptable," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We acknowledge and appreciate our player's public apology and will use this as an opportunity to educate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez, who joined Chelsea from Portugese club Benfica in 2023, said in his apology: "The song includes highly offensive language and there is absolutely no excuse for these words.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I stand against discrimination in all forms and apologise for getting caught up in the euphoria of our Copa America celebrations." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal and Casper Ruud saved a match point in the deciding set tie-break to reach the semi-finals of the doubles in Bastad on Wednesday, hours after the Norwegian was knocked out of the singles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadal and Ruud squeezed past France's Theo Arribage and Roman Safiullin of Russia 6-4, 3-6, 12-10 to advance to the last four, winning the final three points of the match after being on the brink of defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we had some fun. It was an emotional match at the end, a good level of tennis against two good players," said Nadal, who is also competing in the singles tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We enjoy it, the crowd was amazing. Full crowd in a doubles match, that's fantastic. Just enjoying every single day here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Nadal and Ruud wait to discover their semi-final opponents, the Spaniard will be back in action on Thursday against Britain's Cameron Norrie in the round of 16 in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam champion returned to competition for the first time this week since his early French Open exit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will hope to avoid the same fate as Ruud, whose Olympic preparations took a hit when he lost 6-3, 6-3 to Thiago Monteiro in the second round earlier on Wednesday. (AFP)

 Ecuador's Richard Carapaz won stage 17 of the Tour de France after the remnants of a breakaway finished ahead of the main pretenders in the High Alps on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  EF rider Carapaz dropped Simon Yates and soloed the final 10km to win his first ever Tour de France stage after finishing third overall in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Giro d'Italia champion, who won the Tokyo Olympics road race, also wore the overall leader's yellow jersey after his efforts in the second stage to Bologna.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall leader Tadej Pogacar, defending champion Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel kept their powder dry until late in the medium mountain run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio then produced an entertaining scrap with third-placed Evenepoel finishing 12sec ahead of Pogacar, with Vingegaard losing two seconds to the leader. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rory McIlroy bumps fists with a fan after a practice round ahead of the 152nd British Open Golf Championship at Royal Troon. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762031_1_20240718004735.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers has said he "doesn't care" that the British Open's prize fund is not among the top 25 in men's golf.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Royal & Ancient Golf Club announced minimal increases to prize money for the 152nd British Open this week amid "concern" about the impact on financial sustainability and the perception of men's golf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner at Royal Troon on Sunday will receive £2.38 million (US$3.1 million), which is an increase of just US$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bryson DeChambeau earned US$4.3 million for winning last month's US Open, while Scottie Scheffler's Masters victory in April came with a US$3.6 million prize.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total British Open prize fund of US$17 million is up by just US$500,000 on last year and stands as less than the other three majors, 12 PGA Tour events and all 14 Liv Golf events.

  "A, I didn't know, and B, I don't care," said Slumbers, who is set to step down from his role in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we will always offer a very competitive prize fund for the Open, our wider focus is on increasing participation and improving pathways in golf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to make choices about how we allocate resources and make the resources we have go as far as they can. Our responsibility is to ensure the game is thriving 50 years from now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not worried about being a lone voice. Sometimes leadership is lonely."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 158 players, rather than the usual 156, will contest this year's British Open after more past champions than expected opted to play at Royal Troon, with 18 players from Liv Golf in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But while USGA chief executive Mike Whan said last month he is serious about creating a formal pathway for Liv players into the US Open, Slumbers suggested that was not necessary for the British Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We decided after last year's event that we wanted to ensure that there was sufficient enough opportunities for all players, whichever tour they're playing on, to get into the Open," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used our Open Qualifying Series. We picked events that were available for all players. We used the Asian Tour and we used final qualifying to create those opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will that evolve in the coming years? I think that depends on how the game evolves. But we will continue to want the best players in the world to be able to get into the Open in an appropriate way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for future venues, Slumbers said that the Open was "absolutely" going to return to Muirfield for the first time since 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The possibility of staging the Open outside the UK for the first time also remains on the agenda, with Portmarnock having asked the Irish government for support in putting forward a case to stage the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are fully supportive of the club doing that and we are actively engaged in making those assessments," Slumbers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But no decisions have been made because we don't even know if it's possible." (AFP)

 Boston's Jarren Duran, the All-Star MVP, hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the fifth inning as the American League beat the National League 5-3 on Tuesday night for its 10th win in the past 11 All-Star Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes pitched a hitless first for the NL, twice hitting 100mph, and Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run homer in the third for a 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Juan Soto hit a two-run double and scored on David Fry's single to tie the score in the third, and Duran went deep off Cincinnati's Hunter Greene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duran is the fifth Boston player to be an All-Star MVP, the first since J.D. Drew in 2008. The others were Pedro Martinez in 1999, Roger Clemens in 1986 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. (AP)
