<div class="itemFullText">
 Regan Smith set the 100 metres backstroke world record at the US Olympic trials in Indianapolis on Tuesday, touching the wall first in 57.13 to shave 0.2 seconds off Australian Kaylee McKeown's previous mark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just over a month to go before the Games, Smith's win in the final sealed her place on the US team and sets up a Paris showdown with McKeown, who swam 57.33 in Hungary last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud of myself," Smith said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Backstroke is hard for me sometimes but to fight back like this and get that back means a lot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff was second with a time of 57.91.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith, a three-time Olympic medallist who took bronze in the event at the Tokyo Games, still has two more events to contest at the trials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the second world mark to fall at Indianapolis after Gretchen Walsh smashed the record on the 100 metres butterfly on Saturday, an event in which Smith also swam and set a personal best time. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Edmonton Oilers held off a furious late rally to defeat the Florida Panthers 5-3 and keep their dreams of an improbable Stanley Cup Final comeback alive on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Oilers, down 3-0 after the first three games of the best-of-seven series, built on the momentum from their 8-1 thrashing of Florida on Saturday to claim a hard-fought road win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers now have the chance to level the series with a victory on their home ice in Edmonton in game six on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edmonton are bidding to become only the second team in ice hockey history to overturn a 3-0 series deficit to lift the Stanley Cup after Toronto achieved the feat in 1942.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor McDavid's second goal of the night in the dying seconds sealed a pulsating victory for the Oilers, who are hoping to end Canada's 31-year wait for a Stanley Cup champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor Brown fired the short-handed Oilers into the lead after just 5min 30, snaffling possession near halfway during a Florida power play before coolly rounding Sergei Bobrovsky and tucking away the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers doubled their lead early in the second period with a power-play goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They held firm after McDavid's second goal of the night, an empty-netter, ensured a game six on Saturday morning at eight, Hong Kong time. (AFP)

    Baseball legend Willie Mays dies at 93

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John F. Kennedy Jr. with Willie Mays at Shea Stadium in New York in June 1972. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758073_1_20240619100119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Willie Mays, the Hall of Fame centerfielder whose all-around skills made him one of greatest baseball players of all time, died on Tuesday at the age of 93, Major League Baseball announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mays, who brought an explosive exuberance to the game in his peak years, died of heart failure, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays played 23 seasons for the New York Giants, San Francisco Giants and New York Mets, from 1951 through 1973.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his prime, he could do it all on the baseball field. Mays was the epitome of what came to be known as a "five-tool player" – meaning he was exceptional at hitting for average, hitting for power, fielding, throwing and base running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Mays' talent was only part of what made him a superstar. He also played with a verve and passion that were discernible even to spectators in the cheap seats. He was known for playing stickball with kids on the streets of Harlem, near the former Polo Grounds where he played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the real games, fans delighted when Mays would sprint with such speed and fury that he would run out from under his hat as he stole a base or chased down a flyball to deep centerfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His snag of a fly ball in the 1954 World Series, sprinting with his back toward home plate some 460 feet away, is known simply as The Catch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays, known as "The Say Hey Kid" because of his standard greeting, was ranked second on The Sporting News' 1998 list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players – behind Babe Ruth and ahead of Ty Cobb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year of eligibility, won the Most Valuable Player award twice and was named to the all-star team 24 times, a record shared only with Hank Aaron and Stan Musial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he retired, Mays held third place on the all-time home run list with 660, behind Aaron at 755 and Ruth with 714. He was also the first ballplayer to hit 300 homers and steal 300 bases. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal beat the Czech Republic 2-1 to claim a Euro 2024 debut victory on Tuesday but they needed to come from behind with a 92nd-minute winner from youngster Francisco Conceicao.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the section's other clash, Turkey bested Georgia 3-1 in a pulsating match in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roberto Martinez's Portugal qualified at a canter with a 100 percent record, but only just scraped victory in Leipzig in their first match, under driving rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czechs went ahead against the run of play through Lukas Provod's fine strike from the edge of the box after the hour mark, but Robin Hranac's own goal soon pulled Portugal level before Conceicao's winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronaldo was thrice denied by goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek on a record Euros appearance and headed against the post, but was offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diogo Jota put the rebound into the net but the goal was disallowed after the VAR highlighted Al Nassr striker Ronaldo's infringement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not matter for Portugal in the end as 21-year-old Porto winger Conceicao struck from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czechs were left agonising after battling so hard and almost claiming a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It hurts terribly when you work like this for 90 minutes, you give everything and you lose in the end," said Czech goalscorer Provod.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our defenders played an incredible game. We just needed a bit more luck."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A well-supported Turkey started the Euros in entertaining fashion with an end-to-end win over debutants Georgia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid playmaker Arda Guler scored a brilliant goal, along with strikes by Mert Muldur and Kerem Akturkoglu, to delight the masses of Turkish supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia were dangerous after Georges Mikautadze levelled Muldur's superbly hit opener, and struck the woodwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was below his best but despite defeat his team offered enough to give themselves hope for the matches ahead, against the Czech Republic and then Portugal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum produced a dazzling 31-point display as the Boston Celtics dominated the Dallas Mavericks 106-88 to clinch a record-breaking 18th NBA championship crown on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Humbled by Dallas in a 38-point game four drubbing on Friday, Boston slammed the door on any chance of a Mavericks fightback to seal a 4-1 series victory at an electric TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tatum spearheaded a superb performance at both ends of the floor as Boston pulled clear of their arch-rival Los Angeles Lakers to stand alone with 18 NBA titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The emphatic win came 16 years to the day after Boston's last NBA Finals win – over the Lakers – in 2008. (AFP)

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757878_1_20240618083506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka and three-time Grand Slam runner up Ons Jabeur say they will not compete at this year's Paris Olympics in order to prioritise their health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Especially with all the struggles I've been struggling with the last months, I feel I have to take care of my health," Sabalenka told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tennis events at this summer's Games take place on clay between July 27-August 4, meaning a switch back to clay immediately after the grass season and before the hard-court run up to the U.S. Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belarus' Sabalenka, 26, lost to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the French Open quarter-finals earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is set to return to action this week in Berlin, having suffered from a stomach illness at Roland-Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was the worst experience I had in my life on court," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tunisian Jabeur, 29, underwent surgery last year on her right knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After consulting with my medical team regarding attending to the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeapordize the rest of my season," Jabeur said on her social media accounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Olympics," she added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Otago Highlanders back Connor Garden-Bachop has died aged 25 after an unspecified "medical event", New Zealand Rugby said Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Connor passed away on Monday following a medical event, and rugby's collective focus at this time is on supporting his family," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement without giving further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garden-Bachop, the son of former All Black Stephen Bachop, played for the Highlanders in this season's Super Rugby competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winger, who also played representative rugby for the Maori All Blacks, comes from a family of New Zealand internationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His mother, Susan Garden-Bachop, played for New Zealand's Black Ferns, while his uncle Graeme Bachop also played for the All Blacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garden-Bachop, who was the father of twin girls, made his debut for the Highlanders in 2021, going on to make 30 appearances in Super Rugby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club had said he was one of several players not returning next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent post on social media platform Instagram, Garden-Bachop praised the Dunedin-based team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you @highlandersteam for an unforgettable five years," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to everyone in the south for making me feel at home, and thank you to the boys I have been honoured to share the field with, it's been a pleasure, I will miss you all. Till next time." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappe came off late on with a broken nose as France edged Austria 1-0 in their opening game at Euro 2024 on Monday, after Slovakia inflicted a surprise 1-0 defeat on Belgium and Romania beat Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France, the runners-up at the 2022 World Cup, are one of the standout contenders for European Championship glory in Germany, but they did not entirely convince against a hard-running Austria side and needed a Maximilian Woeber own goal to claim the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defender Woeber diverted Mbappe's cutback into his own net seven minutes before half-time in Duesseldorf to decide the Group D game and leave France level on three points at the top of the section with the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe may have made the goal, but it was otherwise a difficult night for the new Real Madrid signing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was denied twice by Austrian goalkeeper Patrick Pentz in the first half and failed to hit the target from a glorious chance when sent clean through 10 minutes after the restart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe then had to come off in the 90th minute after being left with a bloodied nose in an accidental collision with Austrian defender Kevin Danso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source close to the France captain confirmed shortly after the game that his nose was broken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium may no longer rank among the leading contenders but they were not expected to start with a defeat against Slovakia in Frankfurt, where Ivan Schranz of Slavia Prague scored the only goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schranz struck in the seventh minute, firing home the rebound after Belgian goalkeeper Koen Casteels had saved from Juraj Kucka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an especially frustrating day for Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku, who missed a host of chances and had a late equaliser controversially disallowed by VAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had already had one effort ruled out for a marginal offside call before he swept home a Lois Openda cutback in the 86th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, however, the goal was disallowed because the ball had brushed Openda's hand at the beginning of the move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania won at a major international tournament for the first time in 24 years as they beat Ukraine 3-0 with the help of two errors from goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Nicolae Stanciu's magnificent long-range strike – following a misplaced Lunin clearance – gave Romania, backed by the vast majority of the Munich crowd, a first-half lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Razvan Marin's shot from distance then skipped under Lunin as Romania turned the screw with two more goals before the hour, Denis Dragus tapping home the third. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The star of French rugby and pin-up for this summer's Paris Olympics Antoine Dupont has called for an end to the "macho" cliches linked to the game and "stop homophobia in our sport."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old, who was World Rugby men's 15s Player of the Year in 2021, made the comment in an interview in the next edition of the French LGBTQ magazine Tetu, to be published on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only one professional rugby player in France, Jeremy Clamy-Edroux who plays for third division Rouen, has publicly declared his homosexuality but Dupont said there were certainly more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I very much doubt that there is only one gay on the pitch!" the Toulouse and France scrum-half said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal is for all players to feel good about their sexuality and to be accepted by others."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if rugby can be seen as macho, we are very open-minded, and today I think we are all capable of accepting each other's sexual orientations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really need to repeat it, communicate about it, so that everyone definitely feels comfortable with it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupont captained France in last year's World Cup and is poised to line up for the sevens team at this summer's Games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly minted world record-holder Gretchen Walsh punched her ticket to the Paris Olympics on Sunday with a victory in the women's 100 metres butterfly in a swift time of 55.31 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old American couldn't match the astonishing 55.18 she threw down in the semi-finals of the US Olympic swimming trials to shatter Sweden's Sarah Sjoestroem's previous mark of 55.48 -- but she clocked the second-fastest time ever and secured a berth at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still in shock," Walsh said. "I don't even know what to say. Making the team was the biggest goal, but getting a world record was absolutely insanity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walsh's mark in the butterfly on Saturday was the third world record set in women's swimming over the past couple of months, coming on the back of Canadian Summer McIntosh's effort in the 400 metres individual medley and Australian star Ariarne Titmus' blistering time in the 200 metres freestyle.

    Vu wins LPGA Meijer Classic after playoff thriller

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lilia Vu holds the Meijer LPGA Classic trophy. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757722_1_20240617083239.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lilia Vu staged a sensational final round charge before snatching victory in a playoff to win the LPGA Meijer Classic in Michigan on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vu fired a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 at Blythefield Country Club in suburban Grand Rapids to finish with a 72-hole 16-under-par aggregate of 272.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was good enough to send the two-time major champion into a sudden-death playoff with Lexi Thompson and Australia's Grace Kim, who wilted over the final 18 holes after leading by five shots after Saturday's third round. Kim advanced to the playoff after a closing one-over 73.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three women all grabbed birdies on the first playoff hole, the par-five 18th, and then repeated the trio of birdies after replaying 18 for the second playoff hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On both occasions Kim had difficult eagle putts to snatch victory but was unable to convert either. The third playoff hole headed to the par-five fourth, and it was Vu who kept her nerve as the tension mounted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old from California looked to be in trouble after sending her second shot into a greenside bunker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a brilliant sand wedge left her with a short birdie putt, and after Thompson and Kim missed their birdie chances, she duly rolled in the six-footer to clinch the fifth LPGA title of her career. (AFP)

    DeChambeau edges McIlroy by one stroke to win US Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bryson DeChambeau celebrates with the US Open trophy. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757721_1_20240617082133.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryson DeChambeau captured his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy by one stroke in a dramatic back-nine duel at Pinehurst.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old American, who also won the 2020 US Open, fired a one-over-par 71 to finish on six-under-par 274 while McIlroy shot 69 to stand on 275 after 72 holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, thwarted in a bid to end a 10-year major win drought, led by two strokes with five holes to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland made bogeys on three of the last four holes to help hand the trophy to DeChambeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a collapse mindful of Greg Norman's epic 1996 last-round loss to Nick Faldo at Pinehurst, McIlroy missed par putts from 2.5 feet at the par-3 17th and just inside four feet at the par-4 18th -- tension-packed misses for bogeys that left McIlroy one behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau found dirt and weeds left and a bunker at 18 but blasted his third shot to four feet and sank his pressure-packed putt for the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raising his arms in triumph, DeChambeau screamed and jumped for joy, then paid tribute to the late Payne Stewart, the 1999 US Open winner at Pinehurst who died only a few months later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's Payne right there, baby," DeChambeau said into a television camera, pointing to a pin of Stewart on his cap. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England's Jude Bellingham celebrates scoring their first goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757720_1_20240617081811.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England got their quest for a first major tournament title in 58 years off to a winning start as Jude Bellingham's header was enough to beat Serbia 1-0, while the Netherlands grabbed a late 2-1 win over Poland on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Christian Eriksen enjoyed a fairytale return to the European Championship, three years after suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch, by scoring the opening goal, but Denmark were held 1-1 by Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England had been hyped as one of the favourites for the tournament as Gareth Southgate aims to finally steer a richly-talented generation to glory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they left plenty of room for improvement in a flat tournament debut in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham was the exception as the Real Madrid midfielder confirmed his status as one of the world's rising stars with a man-of-the-match display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first half showed why we can score goals against any team and the second half showed why we can keep clean sheets against any team," said Bellingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old became the first European player to grace three major tournaments before turning 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he capped a brilliant individual display with the only goal when he headed in Bukayo Saka's deflected cross on 13 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were forced to see out a nervy finale as Jordan Pickford turned over Dusan Vlahovic's dipping drive before Harry Kane headed away Veljko Birmancevic's goalbound shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the Netherlands, Wout Weghorst struck in the 83rd minute, just two minutes after coming on as a substitute, to secure an opening Group D victory against Poland, who were without the injured Robert Lewandowski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the Poland supporters whose voices echoed around the Volksparkstadion when Adam Buksa headed their team in front early on, but Cody Gakpo levelled an entertaining encounter before the half-hour mark with the aid of a deflection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo, Memphis Depay and Denzel Dumfries all went close as the missed chances piled up for the Oranje, and Ronald Koeman's men looked to be running out of ideas until Weghorst swooped to slot home a deserved winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksen collapsed during Denmark's opening game at the delayed Euro 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exactly 1,100 days on, the Manchester United midfielder put the Danes in front with a sweet strike in Stuttgart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do think this time my story at the Euros is very different from the last one," said Eriksen. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong windsurfer Hayley Chan has won a bronze medal in the wing foil European Championships in Switzerland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She defeated French windsurfer Anais Mai Desjardins by 11 points in the final to come third, with two Italian athletes above Chan on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan, 33, beat fellow SAR athlete Ngai Wai-yan in the previous round. Ngai finished fifth in the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Windsurfing Association of Hong Kong, China said this was Chan's first go at the European Championships, having twice been an Asian champion. She's also a two-time Olympian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association said two others it sponsored in the race, Rafeek Kikabhoy and Chow Tsz-hei, finished 13th and 18th respectively in the men's race. Another Hongkonger, Era Lin, meanwhile, came 26th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes will return to the SAR after the competition to prepare for the wing foil world cup in August, the association said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryson DeChambeau brushed off hip issues to move three shots clear at the top of the US Open third round leaderboard on Saturday, setting up a potential mouth-watering showdown with world number three Rory McIlroy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On another steamy afternoon at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, DeChambeau recovered from an early bogey and troublesome hip that required treatment mid-round to return a three-under 67 to lead Frenchman Matthieu Pavon (69), Patrick Cantlay (70) and McIlroy (69) by three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sitting a further two back and five off the pace are Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (70) and young Swede Ludvig Aberg (73), who had held a one shot lead after the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Trying to stay in the moment, obviously hip wasn't feeling great but luckily I've got a good team and we're going to go figure that out after," said DeChambeau. "I just got two hips that are not fantastic just because of the speed training I do that's the consequences of it but I'll be ready tomorrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had it for a long time now. It's just something that popped up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau will be partnered with Pavon for Sunday's final round but it is McIlroy, paired with Cantlay, who he will share the spotlight with as the former-U.S. Open winners and two of golf's most intriguing figures grapple for the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, bidding to end a decade-long major drought, may be one of golf's most popular figures but the big-hitting DeChambeau has evolved into one of the most entertaining and has enjoyed the backing of huge crowds at Pinehurst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be some golf politics and bragging rights at stake on Sunday with 2020 U.S. Open winner DeChambeau now playing on the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour and McIlroy, long one of the most vocal critics of the renegade circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will mark the 10th time McIlroy has appeared in the top three going into the final round of a major while DeChambeau has played some of the best golf at the biggest events, finishing runner-up at last month's PGA Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking forward to another Sunday in the mix at a major," said McIlroy, who won the last of his four majors at the PGA Championship in 2014. "Awesome opportunity, really excited to be in the position I am in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is what we practice for, this is what we dream of, so really excited for the opportunity, going to go out there tomorrow and give it my all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau broke away from the leading pack with a birdie at the 10th but on his way to the 11th was stretched out on the ground having work done on his hip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any concerns about fitness were quickly dispelled when DeChambeau stepped onto the tee and hammered his longest drive of day at 359-yards before draining a 13-footer for back-to-back birdies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau extended his advantage to four with his third birdie in five holes at the 14th but just when it appeared he might run away from the field was pulled back with a double bogey at the 16th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old responded immediately, rolling in a 12-footer for his sixth birdie triggering wild cheers and chants of "USA, USA".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was amazing," gushed DeChambeau of the fan support. "Man, they riled me up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It just gives me a spike in my adrenaline and allows me to focus more on delivering for the fans and for myself and for my family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It just inspires me." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning champions England maintained their bid to reach the second round of the T20 World Cup with a 41-run victory in a must-win group game against Namibia in Antigua on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anything other than an England win would have seen Jos Buttler's men knocked out and they were left fearing an early exit when rain delayed the scheduled start by three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, in a match eventually reduced from 11 to 10 overs per side by a fresh downpour, collapsed to 13-2 after losing the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a stand of 56 between the Yorkshire duo of Harry Brook (47 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (31) revived England's innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Namibia were left with a target of 126 under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method for rain-interrupted matches. But the non-Test nation were never up with the required run-rate and finished on 84-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory took England level on points with Scotland in Group B but with a superior net run-rate – the tie-breaker for teams on equal points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, however, could still be knocked out should Scotland achieve a stunning upset win over already-qualified Australia in the final Group B fixture in St Lucia later on Saturday, or if that game ends in a no-result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Ruben Trumpelmann bowled England captain Buttler, one of the world's best white-ball batsman, for a four-ball duck as he nipped one back sharply off the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran all-rounder David Wiese then produced a magnificent slower ball to have Phil Salt, England's other opener, caught behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain stopped play with England 82-3 off eight overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the match resumed, Brook did the damage in an over from Namibia teenage paceman Jack Brassell, which cost 19 runs, before Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone struck three sixes between them in the last over from Trumpelmann (2-31).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The already-eliminated Namibia retired opener Nikolaas Davin out for 18 to allow the big-hitting Wiese to come in at 44-1 off six overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even with the 39-year-old Wiese – who holed out in the last over of his final international appearance – hitting two sixes and two fours in a 12-ball 27, Namibia finished well-short of their target. (AFP)

    Italy recover to beat Albania, Spain cruise

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nedim Bajrami celebrates scoring the fastest goal ever at a European Championship. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757622_1_20240616064233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy recovered from conceding the fastest goal in the competition's history to get their defence of the European Championship title off to a winning start on Saturday as they came back to beat Albania 2-1 in front of a partisan crowd.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nedim Bajrami stunned the Italians and delighted a huge Albanian support in Dortmund as he smashed in the opener after just 23 seconds, his strike pulverising the previous record for the quickest goal at the Euros of 67 seconds by Dmitri Kirichenko of Russia in 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet Italy's response to falling behind was quick too, as Alessandro Bastoni headed the Azzurri level on 11 minutes and Nicolo Barella's glorious effort put them ahead just past the quarter-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From then on Luciano Spalletti's team looked much more assured, although they really should have won by a greater margin rather than face an anxious finale as Albania pushed for an equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their performance – the first 23 seconds apart – was largely encouraging before an enticing showdown with fellow heavyweights Spain in nearby Gelsenkirchen next Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy are in some ways an unknown quantity coming into this tournament, with the reigning champions having also missed the last two World Cups and failed to fully convince during qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only five of Italy's line-up at kick-off here started the final of the last Euros three years ago, with a new-look team featuring Bologna centre-back Riccardo Calafiori winning just his third cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albania, though, are appearing at just their second major tournament having also gone to Euro 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The novelty of the experience for them helps explain why the home of Borussia Dortmund was a sea of excitable Albanian fans decked in red and black who made up the vast majority of the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They could hardly believe it when their team, coached by the Brazilian former Arsenal and Barcelona left-back Sylvinho, opened the scoring almost straight from kick-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's Federico Dimarco took a throw from the left-back position but played it loosely back into his own box. Bastoni was caught on the back foot, and Bajrami – who plays in Italy for Sassuolo – pounced to control and fire past Gianluigi Donnarumma at the goalkeeper's near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a similar start to Italy's last European Championship match, when Luke Shaw put England ahead inside two minutes in the final at Wembley in 2021 before the Azzurri came back to win on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time they drew level when Dimarco and Lorenzo Pellegrini played a short corner routine on the left before the latter crossed for Inter Milan centre-back Bastoni to head in at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy had regained their composure and soon went in front on 16 minutes, a Jasir Asani clearance dropping straight to another Inter player in Barella, who made the cleanest of contacts at the edge of the area to send a first-time shot past goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They should have added to their lead before the interval, with Davide Frattesi hitting the post after meeting a lovely reverse pass by Gianluca Scamacca in the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scamacca was then denied by Strakosha, while Fedrico Chiesa curled a shot just wide on the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy then sat back, but Albania did not manage another attempt on target and the second-lowest ranked nation in the competition could not find an equaliser despite their best efforts late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Rey Manaj came closest after getting in behind in the 90th minute, but he could not beat Donnarumma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Spain made a dream start to Euro 2024 as Alvaro Morata scored in a statement 3-0 victory over Croatia in Berlin, with Lamine Yamal becoming the youngest player in the competition's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time European champions have often been accused of being toothless in attack during recent major tournaments, but produced an eye-catching display at the Olympiastadion to cut apart a disappointing Croatia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morata broke the deadlock in the 29th minute with his seventh Euros goal, moving joint-third on the all-time list alongside Alan Shearer and Antoine Griezmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fabian Ruiz added a second shortly afterwards with a wonderful individual strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal made his mark with the assist for Dani Carvajal to effectively kill the game as a contest on the stroke of half-time, while Croatia striker Bruno Petkovic missed a late penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This repeat of last year's Nations League final, won by Spain on penalties after a 0-0 draw, suggests La Roja are capable of contending for a record-breaking fourth European Championship title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World Cup semi-finalists Croatia, though, have it all to do if they are to reach the knockout phase for a fifth consecutive major tournament, with games against Albania and holders Italy to come in a difficult Group B.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luka Modric, so often their inspiration, was substituted midway through the second half by coach Zlatko Dalic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain boss Luis de la Fuente named an exciting starting XI, including wingers Nico Williams and Yamal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Barcelona starlet, 16 years and 338 days old, beat the previous record for youngest player at a Euros held by Polish international Kacper Kozlowski, who played at Euro 2020 at 17 years and 246 days old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia enjoyed the vast majority of support from the stands, with their fans holding up one huge banner during their national anthem, reading "When we get going, heaven and earth will burn".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Croatia started slowly, as Spain dominated possession in trademark fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain also showed their increasing versatility under De la Fuente with their first goal, as one excellent through ball from inside his own half by Ruiz sent Morata clean through and the captain made no mistake with a cool finish past a stranded Dominik Livakovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz put Spain in total control just three minutes later, jinking past two Croatia defenders inside the box before shooting through the legs of Josip Sutalo and into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia almost pulled one back immediately as the game started to echo the end-to-end nature of the two teams' thrilling last-16 clash at Euro 2020, won 5-3 by Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon got down quickly to keep out Marcelo Brozovic's shot and Lovro Majer could only find the side-netting from the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia continued to create chances, as Josko Gvardiol's cross-cum-shot narrowly avoided both Ante Budimir in the centre and the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But full-back Carvajal, who scored the opening goal in Real Madrid's Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund earlier this month, put the game to bed in first-half added time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal collected the ball after a corner was cleared and curled a delicious cross into the middle for Carvajal to stretch and stab home on the volley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia tried to press forward early in the second period but left spaces for Spain to exploit and Yamal was denied another record for youngest Euros scorer when Livakovic produced a fine save to turn away his low effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Cucurella, a controversial selection by De la Fuente at left-back, made a goal-saving block to prevent Josip Stanisic giving Croatia hope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Petkovic thought he had pulled one back late on when he tapped in after his penalty was saved by Simon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the goal was ruled out by VAR for encroachment by Ivan Perisic as Spain added a clean sheet to an almost perfect outing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China have posted their third straight win in the FIVB Women’s Volleyball Nations League being held in Hong Kong, rallying past the world’s top-ranked side Turkey on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China lost the first two sets 21-25, 17-25 before staging their comeback, taking the next three sets 25-21, 25-23, 15-13 to win 3-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Cai Bin called it a team victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China next play Poland on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese women’s volleyball team have already qualified for the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss by Turkey means Brazil have replaced them as the world’s No 1 team.

    Aberg chases win in US Open debut, Scheffler struggles
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ludvig Aberg could become the first golfer in 111 years to win the US Open on his debut. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757610_1_20240616003007.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ludvig Aberg, trying to become the first US Open debut winner since 1913, carried a one-stroke lead into Saturday's third round at Pinehurst, where top-ranked Scottie Scheffler was 11 strokes adrift.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's sixth-ranked Aberg stood on five-under 135 as he awaited a 3:35 p.m. (1935 GMT) start alongside 2020 US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a runner-up effort in last month's PGA Championship, DeChambeau was among eight of 12 LIV Golf starters among the 74 players who made the cut for the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also one stroke off the pace with DeChambeau on 136 were ninth-ranked American Patrick Cantlay and Belgium's Thomas Detry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland was another shot back on 137 with American Tony Finau and France's Matthieu Pavon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner takes US$4.3 million and the runner-up a hefty US$2.32 million from the record US$21.5 million purse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Aberg, runner-up at April's Masters in his major debut, could carry off a bit of history as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not since 20-year-old American amateur Francis Ouimet upset Britain's Harry Vardon and Ted Ray at The Country Club in his hometown of Brookline, Massachusetts, some 111 years ago has a player won the US Open on his debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old Swede has had triumphs on the US PGA Tour and DP World Tour since turning professional a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A major reason for his lead at punishing Pinehurst, with its dome-shaped elevated greens and dirt and weeds waste areas, is that he leads all players in both driving accuracy at 93 percent and greens in regulation at 83 percent, mainly avoiding the course's two major danger zones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best any Swedish player has done in a US Open is fourth, a feat managed by Niclas Fasth, Robert Karlson and Henrik Stenson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scheffler, the hottest golfer entering the week and a huge favourite, was six-over and 11 strokes back after a bogey at the par-4 fourth, finding native area left off the tee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler made the cut on the number following a 74 on Friday but was 1-over after seven holes on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was the first player since Tom Watson in 1980 to win five US PGA Tour events before the US Open, taking the fifth last week at the Memorial, and has 12 top-10 finishes in 13 events this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The usually stoic and calm Scheffler, however, could feel the frustration at Pinehurst's unique challenge, flipping his putter in the air and letting it fall after one near miss on Friday and also slamming down his driver after a woefully errant tee shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cantlay, in his best spot after 36 holes in 30 major starts, has a chance to move past Collin Morikawa for the final spot on the US team for the Paris Olympics but needs no worse than a two-way share of second to do it. Four other Americans must win to make the squad for France. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Kevin Campbell once said of Arsenal "to actually play for the team I supported was a dream come true." Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757612_1_20240616004648.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Premier League striker Kevin Campbell has died aged 54, his former clubs Arsenal and Everton announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Campbell, who died after a short illness, holds the record for most Premier League goals, 83, by a player never to win an international cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone at Arsenal Football is devastated to hear of the death of our much-loved former player Kevin Campbell," said Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell joined the Gunners as a schoolboy in 1985, making his first-team debut in 1988. He went on to play 228 times for Arsenal scoring 59 goals and winning a league title, an FA Cup, a European Cup Winners Cup and a League Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To actually play for the team I supported was a dream come true," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 164 games for Everton he scored 51 goals, including nine in five games which saved them from relegation in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone at Everton Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of the Club's most popular and much-loved former strikers, Kevin Campbell," they said on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell, who also played for Leicester, Leyton Orient, Nottingham Forest, Trabzonspor, West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff, said one of his favourite memories in football was scoring the winner in the 2000 Merseyside derby, Everton's last victory at Anfield for 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was at the Kop End and my view, which will live with me until the day I die, is the Blues in the Kop going crazy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January 2001, manager Walter Smith made Campbell Everton's first black captain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He made me the first black captain of Everton, which is something that I'm so proud of," Campbell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell moved to West Brom in January 2005 and was part of their "great escape," as they became the first club bottom of the Premier League at Christmas to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His son, Tyrese Campbell, is a striker who has just been released by Championship side Stoke City after seven seasons at the club. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Switzerland made a flying start at Euro 2024 as Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer scored their first international goals in a 3-1 win against Hungary on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murat Yakin's side raced into a two-goal lead by half-time in Cologne to kick off their Group A campaign in impressive fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duah opened the scoring in only his second international appearance after making his debut earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-born 27-year-old, who plays for Bulgarian club Ludogorets Razgrad, holds dual citizenship with Ghana and Switzerland, who will be relieved he opted to represent them on the evidence of this dynamic display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After providing the assist for Duah's opener, Bologna midfielder Aebischer netted his maiden Switzerland goal with an eye-catching long-range strike just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barnabas Varga's seventh goal in nine starts for Hungary set up a tense finale, but Breel Embolo struck in stoppage-time to seal the points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following reports of a rift between Yakin and his players over tactics, Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka insisted on Friday that the air had been cleared in time for the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recent dinner with Yakin featuring "plenty of wine" healed the wounds and the Bayer Leverkusen midfielder showed his support for the manager with an influential performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland beat France on penalties in the last 16 at Euro 2020 before losing a shoot-out to Spain in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will hope to emulate that memorable run after enjoying a perfect start in a group that also includes hosts Germany, who thrashed Scotland 5-1 in the tournament opener on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland face Scotland in their second game on Wednesday, while Hungary play Germany the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary boss Marco Rossi had urged his side to embrace the pressure of being ranked as one of Europe's emerging forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But their dismal first half proved fatal, showing that comparisons to Hungary's 'Mighty Magyars', who finished as runners-up at the 1954 World Cup, were rather premature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland needed just 12 minutes to puncture Hungarian optimism in ruthless fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aebischer slipped a perfectly weighted pass through the heart of the Hungary defence, sending Duah through to plant a clinical low finish past Peter Gulacsi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duah's celebrations were initially curtailed by an erroneous offside flag, but the decision was corrected by the VAR as Switzerland's players mobbed their unheralded hero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruben Vargas should have sent the roiling red sea of Switzerland fans into ecstasy again moments later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vargas intercepted Milos Kerkez's wayward pass on the edge of the area, but the winger was left holding his head in frustration after his shot cannoned off Gulacsi's shoulder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss were on a roll and Willi Orban wasted a golden opportunity to halt their momentum with a close-range header that was straight at Yann Sommer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a crucial moment as Aebischer doubled Switzerland's lead on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Hungary sat too deep, a flowing Swiss move climaxed with Aebischer curling a superb strike into the far corner from 25 yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga gave Hungary a lifeline in the 66th minute, just moments after he had missed a sitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dominik Szoboszlai's pin-point cross found Varga and his diving header whistled past Sommer from six yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary pushed hard for an equaliser, but Embolo came off the bench to chip a cool finish over Gulacsi in the final seconds. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Luka Doncic starred as Dallas destroyed Boston to stay in the NBA Finals. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757602_1_20240615215718.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic dazzled and the Dallas Mavericks dominated Boston 122-84 on Friday to fend off elimination in the NBA Finals, denying the Celtics a sweep in the best-of-seven championship series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Doncic scored 29 points and Kyrie Irving added 21 for the Mavs, who snapped the Celtics' 10-game playoff winning streak but still have a mountain to climb as they try to become the first team to rally from a 3-0 deficit to win an NBA playoff series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now down 3-1, Dallas will try to stop the Celtics celebrating an 18th title when they travel to Boston for game five on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We knew we have to get it, we can't lose no more," Doncic said. "As we always say, we're going to believe until the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic, roundly criticised after game three when he fouled out with more than four minutes left and could only watch as the Mavs' comeback bid fell short, was dialled in on the defensive end as Dallas held the Celtics to 36.2 percent shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston star Jayson Tatum scored 15 points and Jaylen Brown had just 10 as the Mavs posted the third-largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tim Hardaway Jr added 15 points off the bench for Dallas and 20-year-old rookie Dereck Lively added 11 – incuding his first career three-pointer – as the Mavs topped 100 points for the first time in the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas handed Boston their first road defeat of these playoffs and ended their bid for the 10th 4-0 sweep in Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Doncic and Irving leading the way, Dallas out-scored Boston 22-12 in the paint in the first quarter to build a 34-21 lead – the Mavs' highest-scoring quarter of the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no let-up in the second, the Mavs dominating every facet of the game on the way to a 61-35 halftime lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic scored 25 points in the first half, Irving had 11 and their supporting cast stepped up, too, Lively electrifying the crowd at American Airlines Center with his three-pointer, followed by an alley-oop dunk on the next possession in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think our energy was way higher," Doncic said. "Everybody was locked in defensive end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics, harried at every turn, made 14 of their 41 three-point attempts. They were out-scored 60-26 in the paint and out-rebounded 52-31 – Dallas' dominance on the boards leading to a 16-2 edge in second-chance points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown went to the bench with 2:11 left in the first half after picking up his third foul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic, meanwhile, answered critics with an intense effort on both ends of the floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stripped by Jrue Holiday on a drive to the basket Doncic dived for the loose ball and swatted it to Irving, who played it back to him for a layup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fouled on the play, Doncic made the free throw to put Dallas up 43-25 midway through the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavs were up 92-57 when Doncic and Irving checked out of the game to a standing ovation with 1:29 left in the third quarter, Irving offering Doncic a congratulatory embrace on the bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla pulled his starters late in the third, their attention already turning to game five and their next chance to break out of a tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA titles. (AFP)

    Heavy rain fails to dampen dragon boat race enthusiasm

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of spectators on Saturday flocked to the Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade to watch the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races in spite of the heavy rain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 competitors, representing over 170 teams from 12 countries or regions, are taking part in the two-day sporting event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Singaporean rower said he was enjoying the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a new experience for us because we don't normally race out in the sea. I think in Singapore, we normally train in the reservoir, so the water is much calmer. I think it's a totally new experience for us," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's very great, very lively. I think we do not have such big international competitions back in Singapore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mainland tourist, Mr Shao, said the showers hadn't dampened the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The weather is cool. It is nice to have the dragon boat races here, whether it be from the spectators' or rowers' point of view. Probably because the race venue is close to the city centre, there are many tourists here. I think everyone can feel that Hong Kong is promoting Chinese traditional culture," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The races were organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong, China Dragon Boat Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fireworks display over Victoria Harbour scheduled for 8 pm was cancelled in light of the three Amber Rainstorm Warning Signals issued by the Observatory on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Clinical Germany thumped Scotland 5-1 in their Euro 2024 tournament opener on Friday with the host nation scoring three first-half goals and enjoying a man advantage after Ryan Porteous received a straight red card before the break.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Florian Wirtz opened the scoring in the 10th minute when he connected with a cross that goalkeeper Angus Gunn could only palm against the post and watch helplessly as it rolled into the net during a match in which Germany dominated possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-times European champions doubled their lead in the 19th minute at the Munich Football Arena after a series of passes ended with Kai Havertz picking out Jamal Musiala who took a touch in the area and fired into the roof of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It went from bad to worse for Scotland when Porteous was sent off for a foul on Ilkay Gundogan in the penalty area with Havertz converting from the spot to make it 3-0. Substitute Niclas Fuellkrug fired home a fourth late in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland did get on the scoresheet late in the match through an Antonio Rudiger own goal before Emre Can rounded out the scoring for the hosts. Germany next play Hungary in Group A while Scotland must regroup to take on Switzerland. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Aleksander Barkov and Sergei Bobrovsky led the way as the Florida Panthers moved within a victory of their first Stanley Cup title, holding on to beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 in Game 3 of the final Thursday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Game 4 is on Sunday morning, Hong Kong time. The Panthers have not won a championship since coming into the NHL in 1993.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barkov set up a goal and scored another, while Bobrovsky made 32 saves. Sam Reinhart, Sam Bennett and Vladimir Tarasenko also scored, with the Panthers pouncing on turnovers and quieting a fired up Edmonton crowd until the Oilers mounted a third-period rally that fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will take a comeback done just four times in league playoff history and once in the final – back in 1942 – to bring the Cup back to Canada. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Cantlay racked up six birdies and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy played a bogey-free round on their ways to 5-under-par 65s to share the lead through the first round of the U.S. Open on Thursday in Pinehurst.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cantlay established the lead early in the day, and McIlroy, the 2011 champion, had birdies on two of the final three holes playing in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Ludvig Aberg shot 66 to hold third place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Golfers had to negotiate the tricky greens on Pinehurst No. 2 along with the increasing heat of the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cantlay began the round on No. 10. He got better later in the round, with four birdies on the first eight holes on the front side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Feeling good about my game," Cantlay said. "I've been working hard. I have to just keep putting myself in the fairway, giving myself opportunities and I did a good job of that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time Cantlay has led or co-led in a major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a rough day for Tiger Woods, who shot 74 with two birdies – both on the par-5 holes – and six bogeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler had a mundane 71. Defending champion Wyndham Clark managed just one birdie during his round of 73. (Reuters)

    England thrash Oman to revive T20 World Cup campaign

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England thrashed Oman by eight wickets as the reigning champions revived their T20 World Cup campaign with a record-breaking success in Antigua on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Needing a heavy win to bolster their net run-rate [NRR] as they attempt to overhaul Scotland in the race to qualify for the second-round Super Eights, England dismissed Oman for just 47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England then made 50-2 in a mere 3.1 overs, captain Jos Buttler 24 not out and Jonny Bairstow, who hit the winning boundary, unbeaten on eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This overwhelming Group B victory meant England recorded the largest win in T20 World Cup history in terms of balls remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oman had no answer to England's combination of spin and pace, leg-break bowler Adil Rashid taking 4-11 from his four overs, while express quicks Jofra Archer and Mark Wood both had figures of 3-12 in an innings that ended with nearly seven overs to spare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Number seven Shoaib Khan [11] was the only Oman batsman to reach double figures after Buttler won the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Significantly, England's NRR climbed to 3.081, better than Scotland's 2.16. England, however, stayed third on three points, behind Scotland's five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already-eliminated Oman, who ended the tournament having lost all four of the games, just scraped past the record lowest completed total of 39 at any T20 World Cup, posted by fellow-non Test nation Uganda against co-hosts West Indies in Guyana last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, beaten by Australia after their group game with Scotland was abandoned due to rain, play Namibia on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia and Scotland, however, will meet on Sunday after England have completed their group games. (AFP)

 The Boston Celtics took a major step forward towards a record 18th NBA championship with a decisive win over the Dallas Mavericks in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, taking a 3-0 lead in the series.

  <br/>
  No NBA team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Playing on home court, the Mavericks mounted a spirited comeback in the fourth quarter with Luka Dončić taking 27 points, six assists and six rebounds for the Mavs, while Dallas' Kyrie Irving led all scorers with 35 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the Mavericks' attempts to turn the tide, the Celtics managed to hang on for a 106-99 win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game 4 is scheduled for Friday in Dallas. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 India qualified for the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket win over the United States on Wednesday, with a fifty by Suryakumar Yadav and Arshdeep Singh's four-wicket haul helping them clinch their third win in a row.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Put in to bat first, the Americans struggled as Arshdeep [4-9] dismissed Shayan Jahangir [0] and Andries Gous [2] in the first over. But Steven Taylor [24] and Nitish Kumar [27] set the stage for a competitive total of 110-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India also struggled at the start, with Saurabh Netravalkar sending openers Virat Kohli [0] and Rohit Sharma [3] back early. But Yadav [50 not out] and Shivam Dube [31 not out] steadied the innings and got India over the line with 10 balls to spare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The U.S., second in Group A with four points after suffering their first loss in three matches, will also ensure qualification for the next round if they beat Ireland on Friday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Basketball Hall of Famer Jerry West, a star guard from the 1960s for the Los Angeles Lakers whose profile on the court inspired the design of the NBA logo, died on Wednesday aged 86.
 <br>
  <br/>
  West played for the Lakers from 1960 until 1974, winning his only NBA title as a player in 1972 while being named as an All-Star for all 14 seasons in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won eight NBA titles as an executive – six with the Lakers and twice with the Golden State Warriors in the Stephen Curry era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After leaving the Warriors in 2017, he joined the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive, which announced his passing. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The former head coach of the SAR football team, Jørn Andersen, was on Wednesday confirmed as the new manager of second-tier mainland side Yunnan Yukun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian, 61, quit the Hong Kong, China squad late last month, saying he'd received an offer he "couldn't refuse".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had taken the SAR to its first AFC Cup in more than 50 years, as well as leading the under-23 squad to its first-ever semifinals at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an announcement on social media, Yunnan Yukun described Andersen as an experienced coach with strong leadership skills, saying he can lead the team to new heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland club are currently leading the second tier of Chinese football, with nine wins from 13 matches for 30 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its former head coach, Li Jinyu, resigned last month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimming star Ariarne Titmus shattered her fellow Australian Mollie O'Callaghan's world record in the women's 200 metres freestyle, clocking one minute, 52.23 seconds just weeks before the defence of her title at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Titmus hit the wall at Australia's Olympic trials in Brisbane ahead of O'Callaghan, who also went under her previous world record of 1:52.85, finishing in 1:52.48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at the results, it's unbelievable. I'm really happy to finally produce a swim in the 200 that I feel like my training reflects," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Aussie pair will provide Hong Kong's Siobhán Haughey with stiff competition in the race for 200 metres glory in Paris, with O'Callaghan also expected to duel against Haughey in the women's 100 metres freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus has been in top form in Brisbane, swimming the second-fastest 400 metres freestyle of all time on Monday as she also prepares to defend that Olympic title against the likes of Canadian Summer McIntosh and American star Katie Ledecky. (AFP)

    Ten Hag set to stay on as Man Utd manager

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ten Hag is the first United boss to win trophies in successive seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757040_1_20240612092317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag will remain in the job for next season and has entered into talks with the Old Trafford club over a contract extension despite the team's lowest ever Premier League finish of eighth, British media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision comes after an end-of-season review by the club's board for the 2023-24 campaign, which finished on a high with a shock FA Cup final win over favourites Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's contract runs until the end of next season, with the club having the option of extending it a further 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Ajax Amsterdam coach Ten Hag had come under increasing pressure after 20-times English champions United suffered their worst start to a season since 1962-63 with eight defeats in their first 15 matches in all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They ended up eighth after 14 defeats in their 38 league games and bowed out of the Champions League in the group phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's job security had been the subject of speculation all season and many pundits believed the FA Cup final would be the Dutchman's last game with the team, win or lose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But moments after their thrilling triumph, the 54-year-old insisted he had no doubt he would be back and said he had received the backing of the club's owners all season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm in a project and we are exactly where we want to be. We're constructing a team. When I took over it was a mess at United, and we are on our way to construct a team for the future," he told reporters at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag pointed to United's revolving door of injuries last term, the most of any Premier League team and concentrated in key positions such as central defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also spoke about the breakout seasons of young players such as midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who is part of England's Euro 2024 squad in Germany, and Argentina winger Alejandro Garnacho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Ten Hag's two seasons in charge, United have played in three Wembley finals and lifted two trophies, having also won last season's League Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports said that all eventualities were considered in the club's post-season review and the clear preference was for Ten Hag to remain in charge at Old Trafford. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong ended up bottom of Group E as their World Cup qualifying campaign came to a close on Tuesday with a 0-0 draw away in Turkmenistan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's side ended the competition with two points, the same as Turkmenistan, but with a weaker goal difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile China squeezed into the third round of Asia's preliminaries for the 2026 World Cup by the narrowest of margins despite slipping to a 1-0 loss at the hands of South Korea in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia and North Korea also confirmed their progress to the next round with the national team qualifying as runners-up in Group C behind the South Koreans after Thailand could only register a 3-1 victory over Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Needing to win by three clear goals, or to score at least four with a two-goal victory margin, to climb above the Chinese in the standings, Masatada Ishii's side fell agonisingly short of a spot in the draw for the next round on June 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suphanat Mueanta put Thailand in front eight minutes before the break but Thailand-based forward Ikhsan Fandi levelled 12 minutes after the restart for the Singaporeans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A frantic Thailand pushed forward as time ticked down with Poramet Arjvirai and Jaroensak Wonggorn scoring in the last 11 minutes to take their side closer to their target, but ultimately the War Elephants fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had earlier lost in Seoul World Cup Stadium when Paris St Germain winger Lee Kang-in scored from close range in the 61st minute to leave Branko Ivankovic and his players sweating on the outcome of the game in Bangkok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia, meanwhile, confirmed their progress to the third round for the first time with a comfortable 2-0 win in Group F over the Philippines at a buoyant Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan cruised to a 5-0 win over Syria in Hiroshima that fatally damaged the hopes of Hector Cuper's side, who were overtaken in second place in Group B by North Korea as a result of their 4-1 win over Myanmar in Vientiane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia, who had already confirmed their place in the next round, notched up a 5-0 win over Palestine in Perth to finish Group I with a perfect record. (RTHK/Reuters)

 Evan Rodrigues had two goals in the third period, Niko Mikkola and Aaron Ekblad also scored as the Florida Panthers beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-1 on Monday night to take a 2-0 lead in the Stanley Cup Final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 18 shots for Florida, which was 1-8 all-time in Cup final games before this series started — and now is two wins away from capturing its first championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the win came with a price for Florida as the Panthers lost captain Aleksander Barkov when Edmonton forward Leon Draisaitl launched toward him midway through the third period and hit him in the head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barkov remained down for some time, needed help getting to the bench and went down the tunnel for the Florida locker room for further evaluation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mattias Ekholm scored and Stuart Skinner stopped 24 shots for the Oilers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The series resumes with Game 3 in Edmonton on Thursday night. (AP)

    Real, Ancelotti backtrack over Club World Cup comments

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlo Ancelotti now says his comment that Real Madrid would not play in Fifa's Club World Cup had been misinterpreted. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756848_1_20240610232625.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said his comments to an Italian daily that Real Madrid would decline Fifa's invitation to participate in the Club World Cup had not been interpreted the way he intended, as the La Liga side reiterated its desire to play in the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti had been quoted by Il Giornale in an interview on Monday as saying that Fifa had undervalued the compensation the 15-times Champions League winners should receive in the revamped tournament with 32 teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fifa can forget it, footballers and clubs will not participate in that tournament," Ancelotti was quoted as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Italian distanced himself from those comments in a social media post on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nothing could be further from my interest than to reject the possibility of playing in a tournament that I consider to be a great opportunity to continue fighting for major titles with Real Madrid," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid said their participation in the tournament was never in question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our club will take part, as planned, in this official competition which we face with pride and with the utmost enthusiasm to once again make our millions of fans all over the world dream of a new title," they said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti, one of the most successful football managers in Europe, has won the Club World Cup three times and the Champions League five times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A single Real Madrid match is worth 20 million and Fifa wants to give us that amount for the whole cup. Negative. Like us, other clubs will refuse the invitation," he had been quoted as saying in the interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti, who led Real to a Champions League and La Liga double last season, also said there had been a lot of pressure on managers lately but he had managed to stay passionate about his job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I see nothing particularly new, this has always been our job but the case of (former Liverpool manager Juergen) Klopp is significant. The pressure continues, the burden of responsibility becomes too heavy, obsession takes over," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I keep my passion, that's how I live the match, the game, my job; I've always carried this balance with me. I've overcome moments that weren't always positive; after my experience with Everton I was off the radar, they thought I was finished, I was old."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With all three European club competitions expanded to 36 teams from next season, the Club World Cup has come under scrutiny for saturating the football calendar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, Fifa said they would not consider rescheduling their 32-team Club World Cup after global players' union FIFPRO and the World Leagues Association (WLA) threatened legal action if they did not review their plans. (Reuters)

 Three Valencia fans have been handed eight-month prison sentences after pleading guilty to racially insulting Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior in the first conviction for racism-related cases in professional football in Spain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fans won't be allowed to enter football stadiums for two years and will have to pay for all the court proceedings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fans were detained after a Spanish league match between Real Madrid and Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium in May 2023. The match was briefly stopped after Vinícius was insulted.

  Valencia had already banned the fans from the Mestalla. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sound of cheering crowds and the rhythmic pounding of drums filled the air at venues across Hong Kong on Monday, as dragon boat races took place to celebrate Tuen Ng Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of paddlers enjoyed the fruits of months of back-breaking training as they took to the waters of Stanley, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Sai Kung, Tuen Mun, Aberdeen, and Tai O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sha Tin, the Marine Dragon Boat Team celebrated victory in one of 28 races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere here is very, very exciting. The weather is good too! We’ve dedicated two months to practice. Regardless of whether it's day or night, we all strive together in our practices," said one team paddler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels refreshing to see everyone putting in such effort and working together towards the same goal. It feels great. The atmosphere is exceptional. Everyone is happy, cheering for them together. I will come back to see it again next year," said Sabrina Wang, a tourist watching the races for the very first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, some 190 teams competed off Stanley Main Beach in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris from City University said his team had practised for 10 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We heard that rain had poured every year here, but the weather is fine today. Synchronisation is the most important factor. Individual strength matters less. The overall strength of a team is the essence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said the HKEX team was full of confidence going into their competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We practised even when the Typhoon Signal No. 3 was issued, during an Amber Rainstorm Warning, and even a Red Rainstorm Warning. Today, we were finally able to get into the water. We are thrilled," she said.

 Jrue Holiday had 26 points and 11 rebounds, and Jayson Tatum made up for a rough shooting night with 12 assists and nine rebounds as the Boston Celtics beat the Dallas Mavericks 105-98 on Sunday night to take a 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Luka Doncic, who was listed as questionable to play less than two hours before the opening tipoff, scored 32 points with 11 rebounds and 11 assists — the first NBA Finals triple-double in Mavericks franchise history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he missed a one-footed, running floater from 3-point range with 28 seconds left, ending Dallas' last chance at a comeback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game 3 is Wednesday night in Dallas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavericks need a win then or in Game 4 on Friday to avoid a sweep and earn a trip back to the Boston Garden, where the local fans are already making space in the rafters for what would be an unprecedented 18th NBA championship banner. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull's triple world champion Max Verstappen completed a Canadian Grand Prix hat-trick of victories on a wet, wild and tricky Sunday at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Verstappen, who started on the front row alongside Mercedes pole sitter George Russell, stayed clear of trouble on a day of changing conditions, snatching the lead from McLaren's Lando Norris on the final pit stops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman then grimly hung on to claim his sixth victory from nine races this season and the 60th of his Formula One career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was another brilliant drive from the 26-year-old who dealt with constantly changing weather, pit stop battles and challenges from McLaren and Mercedes while wrestling with his Red Bull's suspension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Williams's Alex Albon came together, bringing out the safety car for a second time, Verstappen pulled away on the restart and finished 3.879 seconds ahead of Norris while Russell won a nail-biting last-laps duel with team mate Lewis Hamilton to complete the podium.

    Alcaraz beats Zverev in French Open for third Slam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Carlos Alcaraz was made to sweat but clinched his first French Open title by beating Germany's Alexander Zverev 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 in Sunday's final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number three has now won three Grand Slams, after his Wimbledon title last year and his US Open triumph in 2022, and he has a perfect record in major finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old also became the seventh man and the youngest to capture Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz shrugged off an early break and blazed through the first set, which he finished with a big forehand winner, but he allowed Zverev to turn the tide and level the match as his unforced errors crept up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having steadied himself, Alcaraz was serving for the third set at 5-3 before another dip allowed Zverev to take the lead in the contest, but the Spaniard raced through the next set despite a thigh issue and raised his game to prevail in the decider. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool on Sunday said former captain Alan Hansen is seriously ill in hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Premier League club is providing support to the family of the 68-year-old former Scotland international, who retired in 1991 to start a successful career as a television pundit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The thoughts and support of everyone at Liverpool FC are with our legendary former captain Alan Hansen, who is currently seriously ill in hospital,” Liverpool said in a statement on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The club is currently in contact with Alan’s family to provide our support at this difficult time, and our thoughts, wishes and hopes are with Alan and all of the Hansen family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will provide any further updates as we receive them in due course, and we request that the Hansen family’s privacy is respected at this time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hansen joined Liverpool from Scottish team Partick Thistle in 1977. The defender won three European Cups, eight league titles, two FA Cups and three League Cups in 620 appearances for Liverpool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hansen’s former “Match of the Day” colleague Gary Lineker wrote on X: “Horrendous news. Thoughts are with Alan, Janet and all the family.” (AP)

    Panthers draw first blood in Stanley Cup opener

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sergei Bobrovsky makes a save in the Stanley Cup opener against Edmonton. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756704_1_20240609113430.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky was unbeatable and so were the Florida Panthers as they claimed Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final with a 3-0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers Saturday in Sunrise, Florida.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bobrovsky made 32 saves to record his second shutout of the playoffs. Game 2 of the best-of-seven series will be on Tuesday morning, Hong Kong time, in Florida before switching venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carter Verhaeghe, Evan Rodrigues and Eetu Luostarinen each scored a goal, but the game's biggest story was Bobrovsky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bobrovsky proved from the drop of the puck he was on top of his game and carried it through to the final buzzer en route to claiming his third career playoff shutout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made first-period breakaway stops on Adam Henrique and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, denied Mattias Janmark's golden opportunity in the second period and then blocked Connor McDavid's one-timer of a cross-ice feed early in the third period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Florida's other shutout during this year's playoffs was the opener of the Eastern Conference final series against the New York Rangers, a series the Panthers won in six games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aleksander Barkov collected two assists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stuart Skinner stopped 15 shots for the Oilers, who were blanked for the first time in this year's playoff run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Edmonton controlling the play, Verhaeghe opened the scoring with his 10th goal of the playoffs at the 3:59 mark of the first period. Sprung on an odd-man rush, Barkov sent a cross-ice pass that Verhaeghe buried with his team's first shot of the affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rodrigues doubled the lead at 2:16 of the second period with another quick-strike goal. Sam Bennett sent the puck deep in the offensive zone and chased it down before sending a pass to the slot that Rodrigues converted for his fourth goal of the postseason run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers continued to push but could not solve Bobrovsky before Luostarinen's empty-net goal with 4.4 seconds remaining sealed the win. It was his second goal of the playoffs. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's sports officials say the national team's performance during the coming Olympics will be "worth looking forward to," although they are faced with more challenges than previous games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The General Administration of Sport of China said it expects athletes to compete in around 210 out of the 329 events at the Paris Olympics next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the national team would take part in all events in diving, weightlifting, shooting, gymnastics, table tennis and badminton – sports that the country is traditionally strong at.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Lingfeng, who heads the training division of the competitive sports department of the body, said the team was making its final preparations for Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the time difference and other factors would not be favourable for the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are perfectly aware that the difficulties and challenges at the Paris Olympics are far greater than those before," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The level of our athletic skills in some gold-winning events has dropped as we're transitioning from one generation of athletes to another."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang noted the United States, which has topped the gold medal table at world tournaments in the past, continues to be one of the main competitors, while other countries are also improving quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the official said the national team has what it takes to achieve "outstanding results" in the French capital after preparing for the games for more than two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they have also been working to instil patriotism into athletes and coaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been educating the national team... to further solidify their confidence and determination to attain good results at the Paris Olympics and bring glory to the country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said doing well at the Olympics is important to turn China into a country that excels at sports.

<div class="itemFullText">
 George Russell put Mercedes on pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix on Saturday after setting exactly the same time as Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Triple Formula One world champion Verstappen missed out on the pole because he set his time of one minute 12.000 seconds after his British rival in a drama-filled qualifying session at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mercedes signalled that they were going to be a threat for pole earlier on Saturday when Lewis Hamilton, a seven-times winner in Canada, posted the top time in final practice with Russell close behind in third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain, which had disrupted both practices on Friday, returned for the first two phases of qualifying but the skies cleared and the sun began to appear just in time for the last-10 shootout that ended in a dead heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell will start on pole on Sunday for the first time since Brazil 2022, joined on the front row by Verstappen who is chasing a Canadian Grand Prix hat-trick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second row will be all McLaren with Lando Norris, a winner in Miami, starting third ahead of team mate Oscar Piastri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the tightest qualifying battles ever in Formula One, the top seven cars were split by less than three-tenths of a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RB's Daniel Ricciardo was a surprise fifth fastest, with Aston Martin's Spanish double world champion Fernando Alonso sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven-times world champion Hamilton, who claimed the first of his 103 grand prix wins in Montreal in 2007, could not quite match his Mercedes team mate's pace and will start seventh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither Ferrari made the top 10, with Charles Leclerc 11th fastest and Carlos Sainz 12th. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wigan Warriors beat Warrington Wolves 18-8 to secure a record-extending 21st Challenge Cup on Saturday as rugby league paid tribute to the late Rob Burrow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former Leeds Rhinos star Burrow, 41, died last week after a battle with motor neurone disease, leading to an outpouring of emotion across Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burrow's shirt number 7 was projected onto giant screens inside and outside Wembley and as a further tribute, the men's final kicked off at 3:07 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the action started, reigning Super League Man of Steel Bevan French set up Zach Eckersley for Wigan's opening try and stretched over for the second himself to ensure his side also became the first team since 2007 to hold all four of the game's major honours at once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warrington rallied and Matt Dufty's late try gave them a glimmer of hope but they were second best throughout and seldom looked likely to win the trophy for head coach Sam Burgess in his first season in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burrow's name and image adorned a large banner near Wembley and fans laid scarves and flowers at a rugby league statue outside the stadium in tribute to the former Leeds number seven, who won two Challenge Cup finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd of nearly 65,000 rose for a minute's silence before kick-off and again seven minutes into the match in honour of the shirt Burrow wore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wigan scored their opening try in the 19th minute when French delivered the ball into the path of Eckersley, who shrugged off Matty Ashton to touch down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ashton's knock-on three minutes later from Harry Smith's high ball kept Warrington pinned back and led to Wigan's second try, Abbas Miski and Jai Field stretching the opposition defence before French touched down following a scrum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liam Farrell marked his fifth final by scoring Wigan's third try and Smith's third conversion gave Matt Peet's men an 18-2 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warrington gave themselves a glimmer of hope with 15 minutes remaining when Dufty arrowed in from the left, Josh Thewlis's conversion reducing the arrears to 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Wigan saw out the final moments with the minimum of fuss to take the trophy for the second time in three years and add it to the Grand Final, League Leaders' Shield and World Club Challenge trophies they already own. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iga Swiatek won her third consecutive French Open championship and fourth in five years by defeating Jasmine Paolini 6-2, 6-1 in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded Swiatek trailed 2-1 early in Court Philippe Chatrier before taking the next 10 games to claim the opening set and go up 5-0 in the second. She stretched her winning streak at Roland Garros to 21 matches and her career record at the place is now 35-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old from Poland is the first woman with three trophies in a row in Paris since Justine Henin from 2005 to 2007.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek also won the French Open in 2020 and the US Open in 2022 and is now 5-0 in major finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12th-seeded Paolini , a 28-year-old from Italy, was appearing in a Slam final for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had never been past the second round at one of the four most important tennis tournaments until getting to the fourth round at the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini will play in the French Open women’s doubles final on Sunday with partner Sara Errani against 2023 US Open singles champion Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova. (AP)

    HK-trained specialists push for national team success

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Davii Wang, a rugby technician, holds a master's degree in sports science and physical education from CUHK. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756593_2_20240608080909.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Olympic Games less than two months away, dedicated Hong Kong-trained specialists are working tirelessly to ensure the country's elite athletes stay injury-free and perform at their very best in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For trainer Ivy Lui, a career highlight came when Liu Yang, one of the Chinese gymnasts she worked with, secured the gold medal on rings at last year’s World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I felt like my dreams from graduation have come true,” she said. “I knew I wanted to help an athlete achieve an honour at the international stage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gymnast also won gold in rings at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so he'll be defending his title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui's journey as a sports therapist began eight years ago when she graduated from the Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, a member institution of the Vocational Training Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending time with the Hong Kong Rugby Union, she began working with the gymnastics team in Guangzhou before joining the national gymnastics team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her days involve giving massages to the gymnasts, to help them relax after training sessions, and treating any injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her work goes beyond physical therapy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To ensure comprehensive preparation, we also recreate a live atmosphere and simulate actual playing time during our gym training sessions in China before going overseas,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another dedicated professional Davii Wang, a rugby technician, holds a master's degree in sports science and physical education from the Chinese University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang was already working with the national rugby team before he went on to pursue an advanced degree in Hong Kong, so he would have a deeper understanding of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The one-year study made my work more systematic,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we use force platforms to test athletes, which can indicate whether there’s discrepancy in their leg strength.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there is a big discrepancy, we will strengthen the weaker leg to prevent injuries.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of Wang's key tasks is to make sure China's men and women rugby teams stay in top form, as they try to book a ticket to Paris through a qualification tournament later this month.

    Alcaraz to face Zverev in his first French Open final
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz triumphs over Jannik Sinner in a four-hour, five-setter. Photo: Reuters." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756579_1_20240608044200.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz started poorly and fell behind early in his French Open semi-final against Jannik Sinner. Later, as both dealt with cramps under Friday's afternoon sun, Alcaraz trailed by two sets to one.
 <br>
  <br/>
  By the end of the latest instalment in this burgeoning rivalry between two young, talented players, an engaging five-setter that lasted 4 hours, 9 minutes, Alcaraz actually had accumulated fewer total points, 147-145.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That, of course, is not the score that matters. And Alcaraz, who says he takes pleasure from challenges, ultimately persevered, pulling out a 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Sinner to get to his first final in Paris. It made the 21-year-old from Spain the youngest man to reach a Grand Slam title match on three surfaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to find the joy (while) suffering. That’s the key – even more on clay, here at Roland Garros. Long rallies. Four-hour matches. Five sets,” Alcaraz said. “You have to fight. You have to suffer. But as I told my team many, many times, you have to enjoy suffering.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won championships at the US Open in 2022 on hard courts and at Wimbledon in 2023 on grass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the No 3-seeded Alcaraz will face No 4 Alexander Zverev of Germany on the red clay on Sunday. Hours before his 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 semi-final victory over No 7 Casper Ruud of Norway, Zverev’s domestic abuse case in Berlin ended, because he reached an out-of-court settlement with his accuser, a former girlfriend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruud started well, but then began to fade, and he was handed some pills by a doctor during a third-set changeover. Ruud looked listless and stopped chasing some shots, a shell of the player who leads the tour in match wins this season and has been the runner-up at majors three times – including in 2022 and 2023 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev finally broke through at Roland Garros after bowing out in the semi-finals each of the past three years. This will be his second Grand Slam final: He blew a two-set lead and lost in five against Dominic Thiem at the US Open in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be the first French Open men’s final without Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer since 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic was the defending champion in Paris, but he withdrew before the quarter-finals after tearing the meniscus in his right knee and had surgery this week. Because he failed to get back to the final, he will drop from atop the ATP rankings, allowing Sinner to rise a spot from No 2, despite his defeat on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously disappointed how it ended, but it’s part of my growing and the process,” said Sinner, who won the Australian Open in January for his first major trophy. “The winner is happy, and then the loser tries to find a way to beat him the next time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old Italian showed up in Paris with a lingering hip injury that forced him to sit out the clay-court tournament in Rome last month. Alcaraz missed that event, too, because of a right forearm issue that he said made him afraid to hit his booming forehands at full force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both men experienced physical problems in the third set. Alcaraz's right hand began to cramp. Sinner had his right forearm and left thigh massaged by a trainer during changeovers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It brought to mind last year’s French Open semifinals, when Alcaraz got off to a terrific start against Djokovic but then dealt with full-body cramps that rendered the remainder of the match anti-climactic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I learned from last year’s match against Djokovic, when I was in the same position as today,” Alcaraz said. “I know that, in this moment, you have to be calm, you have to keep going, because the cramp is going to go away. You have to stay there, fighting.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and Sinner are seen as the future of men’s tennis. The present isn’t too shabby, either. Even though this was not necessarily the most aesthetically pleasing of their nine head-to-head meetings – Alcaraz leads 5-4 – and they combined for 102 unforced errors, there were moments of brilliance that generated duelling clap-accompanied chants of each man’s first name from the Court Philippe Chatrier crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fifth set, with shadows covering more than half the court, Alcaraz moved out front by sliding until he could reach across his body to snap a backhand passing winner for a break point. A forehand winner – one of his 30 in the match – made it 2-0 at the 3½-hour mark, earning a yell of “Vamos!” from his coach, 2003 French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon, it was 3-0, and Alcaraz was on his way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was a great match. For sure, the sets he won, he played better in the important points,” Sinner said. “That was the key.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both players walloped the ball with such force that the ball-off-strings thuds elicited gasps from spectators in the middle of points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner, his rust-colored shirt a few shades darker than the clay, came out ready at the start of the match, barely ever missing, gliding more than grinding along the baseline, stretching his long limbs to get to nearly everything Alcaraz offered. Alcaraz, his right arm covered by a white sleeve, would deliver a powerful shot to a corner, punctuated with a grunt, and Sinner would somehow get to it, flip it back and draw a mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner led 4-0 and it took Alcaraz 20 minutes of striving to simply place a “1” beside his name on the scoreboard. The second set began inauspiciously for Alcaraz, who fell behind 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I told myself,” Alcaraz said, “that it’s going to be a long match.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not go quietly. Getting more aggressive and doing what he could to shorten points, Alcaraz turned things around right when he needed to, using a five-game run to take control of that set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Sinner took the third, Alcaraz pushed the proceedings to a fifth. He closed the fourth with a cross-court backhand winner, then raised his right fist and shook it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's how Alcaraz came through: He came up with a 32-23 edge in winners over the last two sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his strokes, somehow, gaining zest, and the fans, somehow, getting louder, Alcaraz advanced at a tournament he grew up watching on TV at home in Spain as his countryman Nadal piled up a record 14 titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not that it was easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s one of the toughest matches that I’ve played, for sure,” Alcaraz said. “The toughest matches that I played in my short career have been against Jannik.” (AP)

    China women's hockey team hopeful for an Olympic medal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's hockey team has set their sights on a podium spot at this year's Olympics, even though they have a tough road ahead to clinch a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations have been underway for the Paris Games, with the team recently spending almost two months in the Australian city of Perth for a training programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhong Jiaqi, who's playing in her second Olympics, said the squad is more prepared this time than during the Tokyo Games in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we are more confident, and the whole team is in a very good condition,” Zhong said. “It could be because our result in the last Olympics was not satisfactory, so we want this year's Games to be good.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow teammate and defender Zheng Jiali, who is representing China for the first time at the Olympics, said the team is aiming for gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have strengthened techniques and strategies, as well as our fitness. There are overall changes and adjustments,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team achieved its best Olympic result on home soil during the 2008 Beijing Games, where they took silver. One of their coaches, Huang Yongsheng, said the team's success does not stop there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether it's 2008 or after 2008, the goal of the women's hockey team has never changed. We strive to do our best and always work to achieve the best results,” Huang said. “I feel like [the achievement in] 2008 is not our endpoint, it is just a starting point.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two years ago, Australia’s two-time Olympic gold medalist Alyson Annan took charge of the Chinese squad, and coach Huang said it has helped the team grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She brought some pioneering concepts from the West, merging them with what we already had in China, in the hope of better techniques and tactics that fit China more," Huang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team faces an uphill battle in Paris, having been placed in the same group as reigning Olympic champions the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other teams in the same group include Belgium, Germany, Japan and hosts France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team manager Guo Hong said he is certain the team will give their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Everyone has an Olympic dream. But I think we should be realistic and do things gradually,” Guo said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kristaps Porzingis returned from a 10-game absence to record 20 points off the bench and the Boston Celtics snuffed a second-half rally to beat the Dallas Mavericks 107-89 on Thursday night in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Porzingis hadn't played since Game 4 of Boston's first-round series against the Miami Heat due to a right calf strain. He seemed unfazed by the long layoff, though, shooting 8-for-13 from the field while collecting six rebounds and three blocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by as many as 29 late in the first half, Dallas got back into the game thanks to a third-quarter outburst headlined by Luka Doncic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star guard accounted for 10 points during the Mavericks' 22-9 surge to open the frame, with his 3-pointer cutting Dallas' deficit to 72-64 with 4:28 to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics responded emphatically, rattling off the next 14 points to take a 22-point lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Gafford closed the third with a pair of free throws to get Dallas within 20, but the Mavericks trailed by at least 17 for the entirety of the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Game 2 is set for Sunday in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 22 points and added six boards, three steals and three blocks. Jayson Tatum chipped in 16 points and 11 rebounds, while Derrick White netted 15 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic recorded 30 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas, which got outshot 47.6 percent to 41.7 percent overall. P.J. Washington went for 14 points, Jaden Hardy scored 13, and Kyrie Irving, showered with boos all night, had 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Porzingis didn't draw the start, he wasted no time setting the tone after checking in with 7:17 left in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big man tortured his former team, scoring 11 points and blocking a pair of shots in the period to lift the Celtics to a 37-20 advantage after 12 minutes of action. No team has ever built a larger lead in the first quarter of Game 1 in Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston kept pouring it on, using a 14-2 run to go up 58-29 with 4:11 remaining in the second quarter. However, Doncic proceeded to erupt for nine points over the final four minutes of the first half, helping the Mavericks pull within 63-42 by the break. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States beat Pakistan in a Super Over in Dallas on Thursday to achieve one of the biggest upsets in Twenty20 World Cup history and secure their second win of the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pakistan, the 2009 champions, recovered from a poor start to score 159-7 but the U.S. plundered 14 runs from their final over to finish on 159-3 and send the match to a Super Over.

  <br/>
  The tournament co-hosts made 18-1, helped by two wides from Pakistan, before restricting their opponents to 13-1 to seal a famous victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a big achievement beating Pakistan and playing for the first time," U.S. captain and player of the match Monank Patel said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The way we played today I'm really proud of the boys and it was a complete team effort from ball one to the last ball."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan captain Babar Azam bemoaned his side's batting performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We didn't capitalise with the bat and they took a lot of momentum. We lost back-to-back wickets in the middle overs. As a batting unit you need to step up, you need to create partnerships and we didn't do that," Babar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Credit to USA, they performed so well today. They were better than us in all aspects of the game." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jasmine Paolini will play Iga Swiatek in the French Open final after the Italian 12th seed ended the run of 17-year-old Russian sensation Mirra Andreeva in the last four on Thursday, winning 6-3, 6-1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paolini is through to her first Grand Slam final at the age of 28. She had never gone beyond the second round of a major before the start of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number 15 had won a total of four matches in 16 Grand Slam appearances before advancing to the fourth round of the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now she is one win away from an improbable title at Roland Garros as she tries to emulate compatriot Francesca Schiavone, who won the 2010 French Open. Paolini is also guaranteed to break into the top 10 for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I learned I think a little bit later than other players, to dream is the most important thing in sport and in life," said Paolini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy I could dream this moment. I don't know what to say, I'm so emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva had become the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist in 27 years with a shock victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her bid to be crowned the youngest major champion since Martina Hingis at the 1997 US Open was cut short as Andreeva was unable to reproduce the level that saw her put out an ailing Sabalenka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini snatched the only break of a tight opening set in the fourth game, saving five break chances across her next two service games to keep Andreeva at arm's length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The errors continued to pile up for Andreeva and Paolini seized her opportunity once more when it arose at 1-1 in the second set, before breaking for a second time to stride towards the finish line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Andreeva looking increasingly disconsolate and fighting back tears, Paolini applied the coup de grace with one last break to complete a resounding victory. (AFP)

    Premier League clubs vote to continue using VAR

    <![CDATA[<img alt="According to the league, the number of correct decisions made in games has risen from 82 percent prior to its introduction to 96 percent last season. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756414_1_20240607002233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League clubs voted on Thursday to continue using VAR next season after being asked to consider scrapping the technology.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the league's annual general meeting, the 20 teams decided against ending the use of video assistant referees for key onfield decisions, despite a series of controversies last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clubs, however, voted to make improvements “for the benefit of the game and supporters.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said it wants to reduce delays to games while decisions are being made, with the introduction of semi-automated offside technology key to that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The technology will provide quicker and consistent placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player tracking,” it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league also said it wanted to maintain a high threshold for VAR intervention and “more robust VAR training to improve consistency, including an emphasis on speed of process while preserving accuracy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In-stadium announcements will be introduced to improve fan experience, as well as big screen replays, where possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolverhampton Wanderers submitted a resolution to trigger a vote on the use of VAR last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said VAR “led to numerous unintended negative consequences that are damaging the relationship between fans and football, and undermining the value of the Premier League brand.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  VAR has been used in the Premier League since the 2019-20 season. According to the league, the number of correct decisions made in games has risen from 82 percent prior to its introduction to 96 percent last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there have been high-profile errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most notable of those last season came in a game between Tottenham and Liverpool in September when a miscommunication meant Luis Diaz's goal was ruled out despite replays clearly showing the forward was onside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp later called for the game to be replayed after his team’s 2-1 loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said in April that semi-automated offside technology would be introduced in the autumn of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The league said it would continue to lobby the International Football Association Board, which oversees the laws of football, for greater flexibility to "allow live video and audio broadcast during VAR reviews.” (AP)

 A hat-trick from Mehdi Taremi sank Hong Kong, China's hopes of a win on home turf against Iran in Thursday's 2026 World Cup qualifying match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The FC Porto forward scored two penalties in addition to a goal from open play to help seal a 4-2 win against the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma Hei-wai and Anthony Francis Pinto scored for the home team to help them keep pace with the Iranians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result leaves Hong Kong, China at the bottom of Group E with one point, having lost four games and drawn one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran, meanwhile, top the group with four wins and a draw.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men's and women's national rugby sevens teams are preparing to contend for the final berth at the Olympics next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They will have to win the repechage tournament in Monaco at the end of the month for the trip to Paris and are among 12 entries battling for the last spots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's team are in the same pool with Canada, Great Britain and Uganda, while the women's squad face Poland, Czech Republic and Mexico in pool play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's assistant coach, Zhu Jing, said the most important thing is for the team to fight as one on the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said even though other countries are traditionally considered stronger in rugby sevens, Asians, like Chinese, also have their own advantages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of potential, actually Chinese people have quite an advantage. Because we have speed and agility. When we play we are actually better in these attributes compared to players from Europe or the Americas," Zhu told Hong Kong reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach said he's looking forward to seeing good performances from a couple of players. He said Shan Changshun and the captain, Li Haitao, have good physique and awareness on the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, for his part, said the team was focusing on improving their fitness ahead of the do-or-die tournament, as well as working on tactical adjustments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Making the Olympics for sure is every athlete's ultimate dream. We'll do our best yeah, do our best to get that ticket to Paris," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all in good shape, training with great enthusiasm. Also, in everyday life we're all very united as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the players were having extra sessions in the weight room, and the sports science team has helped their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he thinks the team's biggest foes are themselves, and all they need to do is to give it their best shot.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mirra Andreeva fought back to defeat second seed Aryna Sabalenka at the French Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756273_1_20240606024121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's Mirra Andreeva became the youngest Grand Slam semi-finalist since 1997 with a shock victory over second seed Aryna Sabalenka, who was struggling with an apparent illness, at the French Open on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old fought back from a set down against her ailing opponent to win 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-4 after two hours and 29 minutes and set up a last-four meeting with Italy's Jasmine Paolini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva, aged 17 and 29 days, is the youngest woman to make the semis at a major event since Martina Hingis at the US Open 27 years ago and also the youngest at Roland Garros since Hingis in 1997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly I was really nervous before the match, I knew she'd have an advantage," said Andreeva, who had lost both her previous meetings with Sabalenka in straight sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I see the game, I play whenever I want, I don't really have a plan. When I see an open space on the court I try to play, I try to play behind her back or something like this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Me and my coach, we had a plan today but again I didn't remember anything. I just try to play as I feel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will fancy her chances of going all the way to the final when she faces Paolini -- who had never got past the second round at a Grand Slam before this year -- on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka called for multiple medical time-outs as she complained of not feeling well and Andreeva, playing in her maiden Slam quarter-final, eventually took advantage with a composed display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka had powered through the first four rounds but was clearly having difficulties, breathing heavily between points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva, currently ranked 38th, had already secured a breakthrough into the world's top 30 with her run to the last eight, but is now poised to rise further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tournament favourite Iga Swiatek plays US Open champion Coco Gauff in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka had been targeting a seventh straight Slam semi-final and had won 11 consecutive matches at the majors following her second Melbourne title earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was immediately clear that Sabalenka was not at her best, as she made four double-faults across her opening two service games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Andreeva suffered from nerves in key moments, failing to serve out the first set when leading 5-4, before Sabalenka rallied to take a tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It appeared as though Sabalenka would race away from her young rival -- the youngest woman to make the quarter-finals since 2005 -- when she broke in the first game of the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Andreeva hit straight back, with Sabalenka continuing to shake her head and crouch down between points in apparent pain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair traded breaks once more before Sabalenka again called for the trainer, saying she needed "something to make me feel better".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreeva was starting to get on top and levelled the match on her second set point as Sabalenka dumped a tired backhand into the bottom of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka was still grimacing and complaining towards her box early in the third set, but suddenly found her groove to break to love for a 3-2 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She could not back it up with a hold, though, as Andreeva quickly drew level and then moved 5-4 ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sabalenka failed to extend the contest behind her own serve as Andreeva sealed a famous victory in fine style, with a magnificent lob from way behind the baseline. (AFP)
