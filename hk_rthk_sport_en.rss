<div class="itemFullText">
 Caroline Groot of the Netherlands rode to victory to earn herself the first gold medal at this year's Paralympic Games on Thursday in the women's para cycling track C4-5 500 metres time trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The seven-time world champion finished the race in 35.566 seconds at the National Velodrome in Paris, over a second faster than silver medallist Marie Patouillet of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Dutch had broken the World and Paralympic record earlier in the day with a time of 35.390 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French cyclist finished in 36.700 seconds, while Canadian Kate O'Brien completed the podium with 36.873 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holder of the C4 category in this event, Kadeena Cox of Great Britain, fell off her bike early on, and could not finish the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The C4-5 class is for cyclists who have impairments affecting their legs, arms, and/or trunk, but still have the capability to use a standard bike.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Novak Djokovic hits a backhand against Laslo Djere in his second round match on day three of the US Open. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768129_1_20240829130013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Novak Djokovic racked up his 90th win at the US Open on Wednesday by defeating Serb compatriot Laslo Djere who retired in the third set of their second round clash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a four-time champion at the tournament and seeking a record 25th Grand Slam title, was leading 6-4, 6-4, 2-0 when Djere called it quits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world 109, who pushed his countryman to five sets in New York last year, needed a medical time-out to treat an injury just before dropping the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic had himself required a visit from the trainer for what appeared to be a side strain after sealing the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number two Djokovic is now the only man to have won 90 matches at all four Grand Slams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not what we want to see when there's a retirement. Laslo had an injury which took him off the tour for some time and he's been struggling to come back," said Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's such a good player in these conditions and the second set should have been his, he was 4-2 up. I don't know if my winning the second set probably put more burden on him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic will next meet Australia's Alexei Popyrin who he defeated at the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year with both matches going to four sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Popyrin is on a rich vein of form having won the Montreal Masters on the eve of the US Open. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish rider Eddie Dunbar produced a sparkling finish to claim the 11th stage of the Vuelta a España on Wednesday while three-time winner Primoz Roglic produced a late surge to chip away at Ben O'Connor's overall lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Team Jayco-AlUla's Dunbar spent much of the 166.5 kilometre route in a breakaway pack, suffering on the sharp hills with everyone else, only bursting clear 600 metres from the line in Padron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known as a climber, it was a surprise move from the 27-year-old Corkman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His rivals failed to pick him up until it was too late, allowing him to take his first ever stage victory in a grand tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a while since I've been in a scenario like this, if I'm honest," Dunbar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just kind of used my experience," he added. "I was suffering a bit on that steep climb, then I realised everyone else was."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Max Poole (Team dsm-firmenich PostNL) followed him across the line two seconds behind to complete the stage podium. (AFP)

 Romanian qualifier Elena-Gabriela Ruse bounced Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova from the second round of the US Open on Wednesday, beating the Czech 6-4, 7-5 to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have no words at this moment," said a beaming Ruse. "It's just a dream for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruse, ranked 122nd in the world, pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament so far with her win over the eighth-ranked Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech, eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Paris Olympics, opted not to play any hard-court tune-ups heading into the US Open, withdrawing from Toronto with a thigh injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She acknowledged before the tournament that obligations in the wake of her Wimbledon victory "took a lot of energy," although adding a second major after her 2021 French Open victory had boosted her confidence and sense of calm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the 26-year-old Ruse – who thanked her team for seeing her through a series of injuries – next faces 26th-seeded Paula Badosa of Spain, a 6-3, 7-5 winner over American Taylor Townsend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be honest right now, I just want to enjoy," said Ruse, who was especially pleased that her father, Adrian, was on hand to watch her play in the United States for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think my father is the lucky charm, for sure," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Paralympics opened in Paris on Wednesday in a colourful ceremony, kicking off 11 days of competition in a city still riding the wave of the successful Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Games open during a ceremony in a balmy Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,400 competitors from 168 delegations paraded into the venue as the sun set, greeting 30,000 spectators across the historic square.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fine weather was in sharp contrast to the heavy rain which fell throughout the Olympics opening ceremony in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a symbol of inclusion, a mix of able-bodied and disabled dancers performed on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons then expressed his hope for an "inclusion revolution", before Macron officially declared the Games open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eighteen of the 35 Olympic venues - including the Grand Palais and the Stade de France - will be utilised again for the Paralympics, which run until September 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than two million of the 2.5 million tickets on sale have been snapped up, with several events sold out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, which won 96 golds at the last Paralympics in Tokyo, returns with 284 athletes, the most for any delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 126 males and 158 females will compete in 302 events over 19 sports, with 95 being first-time Paralympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China hopes to match their five-medal haul in Tokyo with a 23-strong delegation. Badminton star Daniel Chan and table tennis player Wong Ting-ting were the SAR's flag bearers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has sent a team of 140 athletes to compete in 17 sports, even as the war against Russian forces rages at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 100 athletes from Russia and Belarus will compete under a neutral banner, but they were barred from the ceremonies. (AP, Reuters, Xinhua)

    English coach Ashley Westwood named HK boss

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former English Premier League ace Ashley Westwood was on Wednesday named as the new head coach of the Hong Kong, China men's football team.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Westwood has signed a two-year contract and will get to know his squad at a tri-nations tournament in Fiji next month, though interim coach Wolfgang Luisser will take charge of the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood most recently led Afghanistan's national team, and he's also coached in England and managed in India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He says his goal is to take Hong Kong to the Asian Cup finals once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think first and foremost we'll set a good culture and we will make sure the environment that we bring them into is one that they'll want to play, they'll want to come and learn, they'll want to come and improve. I don't have any reservations about the quality in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I've played here before with my Indian sides, I've seen their standard. I think there's good players here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood started his career in the Manchester United academy and played more than 400 senior games in English football for the likes of Crewe, Sheffield Wednesday and Wrexham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most notably, he was part of the Bradford City team that made it to the English Premier League for the first time in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood turned to coaching after his retirement, working for English clubs before switching to Asia, claiming a league title with Bengalaru in India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll take charge of the Hong Kong, China team for the first time in a friendly match against Liechtenstein on October 10 in Vaduz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former coach Jørn Andersen left the SAR in May, later taking up an appointment with a team on the mainland. In January, he led the team to the Asian Cup finals for the first time since 1968.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the Football Association of Hong Kong, China also announced a HK$500,000 initiative to promote football refereeing, in the hope SAR referees will officiate in international competitions in the future.

  Alcaraz roared home for a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 victory over 186th-ranked Australian Li Tu to launch his bid to add the US Open to the Roland Garros and Wimbledon titles he claimed this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Spaniard pushed his Grand Slam winning streak to 15 matches as he tries to join Rod Laver and Rafael Nadal as the only men in the modern era to win the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open in the same year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He got off to a hot start, seizing a 4-0 lead on the way to pocketing the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tu, who came through qualifying, got to grips with the imposing Arthur Ashe Stadium and Alcaraz's serve to take the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He tried to keep the pressure on in the third, but Alcaraz's break for a 4-3 lead opened the floodgates, the Spaniard winning the eight straight games to take the third set and build a 5-0 lead in the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it surprised me a little bit. In the first set, it was obvious that he started the match nervous," Alcaraz said of Tu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But after the first he started to enjoy, to play really great tennis. I was playing great – probably a few mistakes," added Alcaraz, who had 50 winners and 30 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Spaniard, who won the first of his four Grand Slam titles in New York in 2022, will face Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round, headed toward a possible semi-final showdown with top-ranked Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Sinner, meanwhile, fought back from a set and break down to defeat Mackenzie McDonald at the US Open on Tuesday in his first match since being embroiled in a doping test controversy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Sinner battled to a 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 win over his 140th-ranked opponent on Arthur Ashe Stadium, racing away with 18 of the last 22 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old Sinner was returning to action just a week after it was revealed he had failed two drug tests in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first match is not easy. McDonald played really well in the beginning so I just tried to stay there mentally and find some rhythm to keep going," Sinner said. "I have room to improve and I'm looking forward to that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory on Tuesday was also a first win for Sinner on the showpiece Arthur Ashe Stadium. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wout van Aert won the 10th stage of the Vuelta a España on Tuesday to seal a hat-trick of victories on his debut in the Spanish Grand Tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Belgian Visma-Lease a Bike rider worked with Quentin Pacher on the way to the finish in Galicia, with the French rider leading out but soon accepting defeat against the sprint king.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Ben O'Connor keeps the overall lead from Primoz Roglic on a relaxed afternoon for the red jersey rider, as the peloton rolled in five-and-a-half minutes down on Van Aert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a tricky 160 kilometre ride from Ponteareas to Baiona, with four categorised climbs, as the race moved north after Monday's rest day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not too often that I can win when my family visits me on the race," said Van Aert, 29, who celebrated with his loved ones after his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was my aim to be in the breakaway, I had a hard time to be honest on the first climb, I almost gave up, I had one more try at the top for 50km – we had to fight for a bit of a gap."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Van Aert is making his debut on the Vuelta after a disappointing Tour de France, when he was unable to secure any victories. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigeria's men's football team on Tuesday appointed experienced German Bruno Labbadia as the country's new coach.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 58-year-old will lead the team against Benin and Rwanda in 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nigeria welcome Benin to Uyo on September 7, before a trip to Rwanda three days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labbadia has handled several top Bundesliga clubs including VfB Stuttgart, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) general secretary Mohammed Sanusi said: "The NFF Executive Committee has approved the recommendation of its technical and development sub-committee to appoint Mr. Bruno Labbadia as the head coach of the Super Eagles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the sixth German to lead the Super Eagles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a player, Labbadia was a prolific scorer, notching over 200 goals in a career that included a spell with Bayern Munich. (AFP)

    Harry Kane receives European Golden Shoe in Munich

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich and England striker Harry Kane received the Golden Shoe award as the highest goalscorer in a European football league at a ceremony in the Bavarian capital on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kane scored 36 goals during the previous Bundesliga season, more than any other player in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite being the top Premier League scorer three times, Kane had never won the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a fantastic feeling," Kane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The award is for everyone. Without you, I wouldn't be standing here today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel good and am looking forward to the new season. I feel a new energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud to receive this award."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prize was the latest won by the striker in a long list of personal awards, but Kane is still yet to win a team title in his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane went trophy-less in his debut year in Munich, the first time Bayern finished a season without silverware since 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters: "I want to continue on as I started last season, but it is important to win titles. We want to achieve success as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane's tally of 36 goals in 32 Bayern appearances is just five shy of the single-season record held by former Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski of 41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England captain was handed the award by Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen, who praised Kane's character since making the move to Munich one season ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Created in the 1967-68 season, the Golden Shoe was formerly awarded to the top scorer in any European league, but in 1997 was changed to use a ranking system which favours players in higher-ranked leagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With six wins, Lionel Messi has received the award more than anyone else. Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland have previously won the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is something special that I am now mentioned in the same breath as these names," Kane said. (AFP)

    NFL to vote on private equity ownership

<div class="itemFullText">
 Owners of the US National Football League (NFL) are set to vote on Tuesday on allowing private equity investment, a move that could offer an influx of cash for new stadiums and other projects.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the vote, the NFL's 32 owners are likely to allow private equity firms to purchase up to a 10 percent team stake, according to a CNBC report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of companies that have been approved plan to commit US$12 billion in capital over time, CNBC added, citing people familiar with the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each fund or consortium can make deals with up to six teams, and the firms which have been green-lit include Ares Management, Sixth Street Partners and Arctos Partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also a consortium including names like Blackstone and the Carlyle Group, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other large sports leagues like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association already allow private equity ownership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the NFL – the most popular and prosperous US league – formed a committee to consider allowing private equity funding, and it has recently met with the companies.
  <br/>

    India's Jay Shah to be cricket world body chairman

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's cricket chief Jay Shah has been elected unopposed as chairman of the sport's world body, the International Cricket Council, it said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shah will take over the role from December, after current Chair Greg Barclay decided not to seek a third term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and our member nations to further globalise cricket," Shah said, adding he was "humbled" by the appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our goal is to make cricket more inclusive and popular than ever before."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From being the chief of the world's richest cricket board to leading the ICC, the 35-year-old's meteoric rise illustrates India's domination of the sport's global administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a country where the sport and politics go hand in glove, Shah is best known for being the son of home minister Amit Shah, the right-hand man of Hindu-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shah, the powerful Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India since 2019, becomes the youngest ICC chairman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top cricketers in India enjoy superstardom with millions of die-hard fans, most lucrative playing contracts, and endorsement deals not seen anywhere else in global cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By some counts, Indian cricket on average generates more revenue than Bollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 percent of the sport's billion-plus worldwide fans are in the Indian subcontinent, according to a 2018 ICC study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICC is the global governing body for cricket, with more than 100 members, and is responsible for staging global events such as the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shah said he wanted to "embrace fresh thinking and innovation to elevate the love for cricket worldwide." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Olympics champion Zheng Qinwen rallied from a set down to beat Amanda Anisimova 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Monday and reach the second round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  American Anisimova had Zheng on the run early, but the world number seven from China was able to turn things around for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 triumph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was especially pleased to build on the momentum of her Paris Games triumph, which made her the first Olympic singles champion from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the typical match I will lose, especially after huge success," Zheng said. "Usually after huge success I will get a little bit too high, until the reality slap me down again and I come back to the ground and trying to be humble and work hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng, 21, said before the US Open that she wanted to avoid that kind of let-down, but Anisimova didn't make it easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was really difficult, the match today," she said. "She's hitting the ball very strong and the only things I feel like I can do today during the match is just to stay with her and find my moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seventh-seeded Zheng next faces Erika Andreeva of Russia, who beat China's Yuan Yue 6-3, 7-6. (AFP)

    Gauff cruises into second round at US Open

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff launched her US Open title defence with a 6-2, 6-0 victory over Varvara Gracheva on Monday, firing 10 aces and saving eight break points to advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old American worked through some tight moments early on to polish off the victory in 66 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium, where she captured her first Grand Slam title last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was breezing through the second set when France's Gracheva, ranked 66th in the world, mustered a pair of break points in the final game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff saved both with aces as she booked a second-round meeting with Tatjana Maria of Germany, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Argentina's Solana Sierra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I served well," Gauff said. "Can't ask for a better start into this tournament, so hoping to continue to get better as the week, two weeks go by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff's build-up to the final Grand Slam of the season has been less than ideal. She fell in the third round at Toronto and lost her first match as the defending champion in Cincinnati.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she said taking the long view was helping her stay steady as she tries for the first time to defend a major title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last couple of weeks were tough, and I was, like, 'I have to do this and do that.' But I don't have to prove anything to anyone except myself," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that perspective, "and just having the belief that I can but not the expectation that I should" had tamped down the pressure. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Sox catcher Danny Jansen became the first player in major league history to appear in the same game for both teams when he took the field for Boston on Monday in the resumption of a rain-delayed game he started for Toronto in June.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jansen was in the Blue Jays' lineup at catcher and batting in the second inning on June 26 when the game was suspended. He was traded to the Red Sox last month, and on Monday he took his position behind the plate as pinch-hitter Daulton Varsho struck out to complete the at-bat that Jansen started.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An authenticator was on hand to tag all of Jansen’s equipment, and the Baseball Hall of Fame said it requested the scorecard from official scorer Bob Ellis. Ellis was also working the game when it started in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This scorecard will be a great tool to document and illustrate this history, showing Danny Jansen’s name on both teams,” Hall spokesman John Shestakofsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the ballpark opened to fans, the scoreboards were showing Jansen at bat for the Blue Jays – complete with a picture of him in his Toronto cap. Before the first pitch, the umpires held an extended conversation at home with the coaches who brought out some of the weirdest lineup cards in baseball history. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swedish football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who coached England from 2001 to 2006, died on Monday at the age of 76 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, his agent said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "He passed away peacefully this morning with his family around him at his home," Eriksson's agent Bo Gustavsson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swede, who managed a number of high-profile teams and took England to World Cup quarter-finals in 2002 and 2006, announced in February 2023 that he was stepping back from public life due to "health issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, he told public broadcaster Sveriges Radio that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer and that his doctor's assessment was that he had "at best maybe a year (to live), at worst a little less."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have known about this but it happened very quickly. We were not prepared for it to happen today," said Gustavsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born February 5, 1948 in Sunne in western Sweden, Eriksson, who goes by "Svennis" to Swedes, found success as a football manager after retiring from a modest career as a defender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1977, he became manager of Swedish club Degerfors IF. After leading the small club to success in lower divisions, he attracted the attention of bigger clubs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to manage Sweden's IFK Goteborg before finding success internationally, managing Benfica in Portugal, as well as several Italian teams including Roma and Lazio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most high-profile position was as the first foreigner to manage England's national squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his spell, he took England to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002, where they were knocked out by Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also made the last eight four years later where Portugal came out on top in a penalty shoot-out in a game where Wayne Rooney was sent off after a clash with his then Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksson led England to the last eight of the 2004 Euros where Portugal again knocked them out in another penalty shoot-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left the England job in 2006 after five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His time in the hotseat had seen a memorable 5-1 win over Germany in a World Cup qualifier but also controversy over his personal life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksson then went on to manage Mexico, Ivory Coast and the Philippines, but never his native Sweden's national squad. (AFP)

    Ko wins Women's Open, ends eight-year major drought

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lydia Ko said she had enjoyed a "Cinderella" story after ending an eight-year wait for a major title by winning the Women's British Open at St. Andrews on Sunday, just a fortnight after her Olympic gold medal triumph in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New Zealander finished in champion style with a superb birdie on the 18th hole of a windswept Old Course to complete a round of three-under-par 69 and claim her third major title with a tournament total of seven under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is surreal," Ko said. "Winning the gold medal in Paris a few weeks ago was almost too good to be true. Heading into the weekend I thought 'how is it possible for me to win the Open?'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko entered the final day three shots back of third-round leader Jiyai Shin, a two-time Women's Open champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shin was one of four women tied for second, with China's Ruoning Yin, Nelly Korda and Lilia Vu – each of them former major winners who have been ranked No. 1 in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is almost too good to be true," she added. "Out of all the major championships, this was the one I had the least amount of confidence in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory gave Ko, 27, her first major since she won the 2016 Chevron Championship. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Adam Yates secured a sensational stage nine victory in the Vuelta a Espana on Sunday to revive his general classification hopes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British UAE Team Emirates rider went solo 58 kilometres from the finish in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He crossed the line one minute 39 seconds ahead of Richard Carapaz, who also put himself back in contention with a superb ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never suffered like this before, it's so hot out there," said Yates. "From the last climb I was cramping and I didn't know if I could go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had a lot of bad luck in Grand Tours over the years and I really didn't know if I could make it," he added. "But I'm just so happy I could finally win another Grand Tour stage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Ben O'Connor retained the red jersey and increased his lead on second placed Primoz Roglic to three minutes 53 seconds by claiming four bonus seconds as he finished third on the 178.5km run from Motril to Granada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every second counts, and I didn't lose time today – to some guys, yes – but in the end I showed my real capacity and what I can do, so I'm proud." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish champions Real Madrid earned a 3-0 win over Real Valladolid in La Liga on Sunday as Kylian Mbappé made his Santiago Bernabeu bow without finding the net.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atletico Madrid comfortably beat last season's surprise package Girona by the same scoreline later on in the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's French striker Mbappé played at home for the first time in a Los Blancos shirt but was largely frustrated by Valladolid's defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde opened the scoring after 50 minutes and substitutes Brahim Diaz and debutant Endrick struck late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without the injured Jude Bellingham Madrid created little in the first half but did enough after the break to earn their first win of the season, following an opening draw at Real Mallorca.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still lacking fluency in attack, Carlo Ancelotti's side stayed two points behind rivals Barcelona, who beat Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris celebrates on the podium after winning the Dutch Grand Prix with third placed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767598_1_20240826011450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris stormed to victory at the Dutch Grand Prix on Sunday, a superb drive consigning home favourite Max Verstappen to his first-ever loss in front of his "Orange Army" fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British driver claimed his second career chequered flag after winning in Miami in May, closing Verstappen's lead over him in the world championship to 70 points, with the Dutchman coming second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite raucous encouragement from a packed Zandvoort circuit, Verstappen could not extract enough from his Red Bull to compete with a recently upgraded McLaren that is beginning to look like the car to beat in Formula One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels amazing... The pace was very strong and the car was unbelievable today," said Norris, who also secured a point for the fastest lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The start was critical. Questions have been asked of the starting ability of Norris, who has three times this season failed to convert pole position into a first lap lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And again Norris was sluggish off the line, allowing Verstappen to power around the outside to huge cheers from the crowd, who saw their man take a 0.9-second advantage into the second lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buoyed by the fast start, Verstappen clocked the quickest lap in lap two, putting clear daylight between him and the McLaren of Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the McLaren had been the fastest car in the paddock all race weekend and Norris started slowly but surely eating into Verstappen's lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 17 out of 72, Norris was only a few tenths of a second behind Verstappen, the Dutchman complaining on his team radio of a lack of grip from his tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris passed him a lap later on the outside at turn one, Verstappen powerless to prevent the overtake and quickly falling further behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't go faster. The car is not responding to my inputs," a desperate Verstappen told his engineers as Norris stretched his advantage to more than four seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On lap 25, Verstappen decided enough was enough and he needed a new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris pitted the lap after, his team taking 0.6 seconds longer than the Red Bull for the pit stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, Norris emerged from the two stops five seconds ahead of his rival and promptly produced the fastest lap of the race on his new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 40, Norris had extended the advantage to more than 10 seconds over the three-time champion and just had to stay out of trouble to take the chequered flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His eventual margin of victory was 22.896 seconds, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc holding off Norris's McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri to claim the third podium spot after a thrilling battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's struggling second driver Sergio Perez finished in sixth position, meaning the gap in the constructors' championship also narrowed from 42 points to 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wouldn't say a perfect race because of lap one again, but afterwards it was beautiful," said Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expected Max to start pushing and get a bit of a gap. And he never did. So from that point, I knew we were in with a good fight," added Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But he seemed to just keep dropping off. And my pace was getting better. So it's a nice feeling inside the car. And especially when I got past, you know, I could just get comfortable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The F1 circus now moves on to the famous Monza track in Italy next weekend, round 16 of 24 with everyone snapping at Verstappen's heels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has not won a Grand Prix since Barcelona in June, his longest barren spell since 2020 and while it is premature to talk of panic stations at Red Bull, the Dutch weekend will have given some cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You always try to do better and we had a good start, we tried everything we could today, but throughout the race it was quite clear that we are not quick enough, so I tried to be second today," said Verstappen. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chelsea's Noni Madueke holds the match ball after scoring a hat-trick. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767597_1_20240826004756.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 at Molineux on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chelsea's first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca's side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer, but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves fell part after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side's sixth goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much has been made of Chelsea's huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea's league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today means a lot. I was really just trying to be clever and wait for the right moment," Madueke said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unbelievable. (Palmer) is cold and I am fire so it mixes well. He has the ability to always play a pass at the right time. I like to get the ball in space, beat people and make things happen, so luckily today it worked."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair combined to restore Chelsea's lead in the 49th minute with the 22-year-old Madueke getting lucky as his shot deflected off of Rayan Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That goal sapped the fight out of Wolves and it was Palmer again who sent the over-lapping Madueke clear to slam a shot through the legs of Wolves keeper Jose Sa's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke made it 5-2 with an almost identical goal as Wolves conceded possession and Cole sent him clear to complete his hat-trick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves will wonder what happened after they played some enterprising football in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were caught cold when Jackson headed Chelsea in front after two minutes but deservedly levelled in the 27th minute when Cunha fired home after being set up by Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves pressed for a second but it was Chelsea who went back in front on the stroke of halftime with Palmer producing a delightful lobbed finish from 30 metres with his left foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea were caught out again in first-half stoppage time, however, as Norwegian Strand Larsen opened his Wolves account, stretching out his foot to convert from close range after a free kick was headed across the penalty area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Newcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara's effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought the game was lost because I initially hadn't seen anything wrong with the goal," said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe who was given a warm reception on his return to his old club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have had it for us and against us and we are very grateful for that moment because we have battled hard. But I understand that it is a contentious decision." (Reuters)

 Hong Kong martial arts actor Jackie Chan was named on Sunday as one of the torchbearers in the lead-up to the opening ceremony of the Paralympics in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 70-year-old, known for his stunts and acrobatic fight scenes, will carry the flame on Wednesday afternoon in the French capital just hours before the opening ceremony, the organising committee announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French actress Elsa Zylberstein, and dancer/choreographer Benjamin Millepied will also take part in the torch relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As with the Olympic opening ceremony, Wednesday's event will take place beyond the confines of the Stade de France, with a parade down the Champs-Elysees to the Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame, which was was lit on Saturday in Stoke Mandeville in the UK, the historic birthplace of the Paralympic Games, arrived in France via the Channel Tunnel on Sunday, carried by wheelchair fencing medalist Emmanuelle Assmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about inscribing sport in the hearts of people with disabilities," said French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera who was on hand to welcome the flame, alongside Tony Estanguet, head of the organising committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame was due to continue its journey where it would be "multiplied" into 12 Paralympic flames, which will be carried by 1,000 torchbearers in around 50 towns, in 12 simultaneous relays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These 12 relays will converge on Paris, where the flame will arrive on Wednesday for the opening ceremony. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United crashed to a last-gasp 2-1 defeat against Brighton and an Erling Haaland's hat-trick fired Premier League champions Manchester City to a 4-1 win against Ipswich on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's side were left shell-shocked by Joao Pedro's winner five minutes into stoppage-time at the Amex Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United fell behind to a 32nd minute goal from Danny Welbeck, who poked in Kaoru Mitoma's cross for his sixth goal in 16 appearances against his former club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo equalised for United after an hour, cutting inside for a shot that deflected in off Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Zirkzee prevented Alejandro Garnacho from putting the visitors ahead in the closing stages when the United forward touched home his team-mate's finish on the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, a close-season signing from Bologna, was in an offside position and VAR ruled out the goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left completely unmarked at the far post, Brazilian striker Pedro rubbed salt into United's wounds as he headed home from Simon Adingra's cross to ensure Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler maintained his 100 per cent start following last weekend's win at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old German is the youngest permanent manager in Premier League history after arriving from St Pauli to replace Roberto De Zerbi in the close-season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team deserved to win. These moments make memories and we have to enjoy it," Hurzeler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag added: "Both goals are very soft. As a team, we should have done better. We have to be more clinical in both boxes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City scored three times in four minutes to survive an early scare against promoted Ipswich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sammie Szmodics, signed from Blackburn in the close-season, gave Ipswich a shock lead in the seventh minute, running on to Omari Hutchinson's pass and squeezing his shot through Ederson's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City levelled when Leif Davis's 12th minute foul on Savinho conceded a penalty that Haaland dispatched with ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich keeper Arijanet Muric spent four years with City before leaving in 2022 and he returned with a gift for his old club, dwelling in possession in the 14th minute as Kevin De Bruyne stole the ball and slotted home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City made it three when the unstoppable Haaland flicked De Bruyne's deft pass past Muric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German midfielder Ilkay Gundogan came off the bench for City in the second half after rejoining his former club from Barcelona on a one-year contract on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland completed his treble in the 88th minute with a typically predatory finish for his fourth goal already this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma got back in favour with boss Ange Postecoglou as his superb strike inspired a 4-0 rout of Everton in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou picker Bissouma following a one-game suspension after posting a social media video that showed him inhaling nitrous oxide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know what it's like when you punish your child and they do everything right for the next two days?" Postecoglou had said of Bissouma's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mali international made the most of his reprieve in the 14th minute, lashing home from the edge of the area for his first league goal for Tottenham in his 52nd appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Son Heung-min doubled Tottenham's lead in the 25th minute, forcing Jordan Pickford into an embarrassing mistake as the Everton keeper was robbed by the South Korean for a simple finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristian Romero headed Tottenham's third in the 71st minute. Son bagged his second with a clinical finish six minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui earned the first win of his reign as second half goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen sealed a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Iwobi's 70th minute goal clinched Fulham's 2-1 win against Leicester at Craven Cottage after Emile Smith Rowe's first half opener for the hosts was cancelled out by Wout Faes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nottingham Forest won 1-0 at Southampton thanks to Morgan Gibbs-White's 70th minute strike.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 65 national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics – most of them gold medallists – will visit Hong Kong next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They include diving duo Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, winners of the women's synchronised 10m platform, as well as table tennis champions such as Ma Long, Fan Zhendong and Sun Yingsha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also among the list are swimmer Zhang Yufei, who won six medals in Paris, breaking bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, as "671", and street skateboarder Cui Chenxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the nation's first Olympic tennis champion, Zheng Qinwen, will not be on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes from 16 sports will be joined by eight coaches, and led by director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan. They will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong from August 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will attend a gala show before showcasing their skills at two demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park swimming pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for all three events were sold out in about half an hour on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will also attend a reception and a banquet hosted by the SAR government, and meet local athletes at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, before heading to neighbouring Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team bagged 40 gold medals at the Paris Games, on top of 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian cyclist Ben O'Connor soloed to a stunning victory in stage six of the Vuelta a España on Thursday, taking the red jersey from three-time winner Primoz Roglic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale rider and Gijs Leemreize attacked from a breakaway group before O'Connor later left the Dutchman behind with 27 kilometres to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor opened up a defendable lead of four minutes 51 seconds in the general classification ahead of veteran Roglic, as the peloton came in well over six minutes down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt a little bit in my own world today. I just went for it, I felt today was just a day to seize my opportunity and I laid it all out there," O'Connor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I could win this stage from the start – it's pretty special when you can just go out and crush it like that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor became the fifth Australian to win stages at all three Grand Tours after winning at the Giro in 2020 and at the Tour de France in 2021. (AFP)

    Chelsea give Maresca first win in Conference League

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea secured their first victory under new coach Enzo Maresca with a 2-0 victory over Servette in their Conference League play-off round first leg on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hosts struggled to break down their opponents in the first half at Stamford Bridge before Christopher Nkunku put them in front with a 50th-minute penalty, just his fourth goal for the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guiu somehow contrived to miss an open goal a few minutes later, but Noni Madueke moved Chelsea closer to a group-stage place ahead of next week's second leg by firing home from Enzo Fernandez's pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiemoko Ouattara almost pulled one back for Swiss side Servette late on when his deflected strike hit the crossbar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a welcome win for Chelsea after suffering a 2-0 loss in Maresca's debut game against Manchester City at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Blues are making their return to European competition after finishing sixth in the Premier League last season under Mauricio Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are learning how to manage the game," said Maresca, who led Leicester to promotion to the Premier League last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was important to win the game with nine changes. There were many good things," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was a scare for Chelsea, as key player Cole Palmer went down the dug-out holding the back of his leg at full-time after coming on as a second-half substitute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cole felt something but he looks fine. Hopefully it is no problem and he can be available for Sunday's game against Wolves," Maresca said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets to local demonstrations by mainland Olympians who did well at the Paris Games were all snapped up in a little more than half an hour on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were some 5,000 tickets available for the public to go to two demonstrations on August 31, and a gala show the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The events are part of a three-day visit by the delegation to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people joined an online queue for the HK$20 tickets when they went on sale at 10am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two demonstrations, at Victoria Park Swimming Pool and Queen Elizabeth Stadium, will feature divers, swimmers, gymnasts, as well as table tennis and badminton players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said those who bought the tickets need to collect them at URBTIX outlets or from self-service ticketing kiosks on or before August 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After departing Hong Kong, members of the national team will spend three days in Macau.

<div class="itemFullText">
 England trailed Sri Lanka by 214 runs on day one of the first test after bad light stopped play on Wednesday at Old Trafford where the tourists' decision to bat first backfired when they were all out for 236.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva won the toss and opted to bat under cloudy skies but his side were three down for six runs after seven overs before he led their recovery efforts with a confident knock of 74 in the middle order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were 22 for no loss in four overs with Ben Duckett and Dan Lawrence at the crease. Sri Lanka, who were unable to get their fast bowlers to use the new ball in fading light, opted to walk off with a few minutes left until stumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a good day. When you bowl on day one on a test surface like that, to be batting at the end of the day I think you're really happy," said England's Chris Woakes, who took 3-32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a hard pitch offering assistance for England's seam attack in the first innings, Sri Lanka's openers were stifled early on as the bowlers dominated the opening session to reduce the visitors to 80-5 at lunch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, captained by Ollie Pope with Ben Stokes ruled out with a hamstring injury, were left frustrated when De Silva stitched together a valuable 63-run partnership with test debutant Milan Rathnayake, who came in at number nine. (Reuters)

    Maresca: Chelsea 'not a mess' after more transfers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maresca at Chelsea's season opener against Man City at Stamford Bridge. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767146_1_20240822082401.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca insisted Wednesday he was not presiding over a "mess" of a squad after the London club were involved in yet more transfer activity.
 <br>
  <br/>
  João Felix signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge, with his return from Atletico Madrid to the club where he spent an underwhelming spell on loan in the 2022-23 season helping facilitate Conor Gallagher's move in the opposite direction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca now has one of the largest squads in the Premier League at his disposal, although he has made it clear Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell are not part of his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking ahead of Chelsea's Conference League play-off against Servette, Maresca said criticism of the club's transfer policy had been unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not working with 42 players, I am working with 21 players in first-team training," the Italian said. "It's not a mess like it looks from outside. The other players can even have 20 years contract, it is not my point. I don't care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the position of Sterling and Chilwell, he added: "In this moment, they are training apart from the squad. As I said, the situation with both of them is quite clear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a big squad, for me it's impossible to give everyone minutes so if they're looking for minutes, probably it is better to leave. And in case they don't leave, they have a contract here, they are Chelsea players."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he was understandably more upbeat about João Felix, with Maresca – whose side started the new Premier League season with a 2-0 defeat by champions Manchester City last weekend, saying: "He is a good player, a talent. The club already knows him from two years ago."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He can play different positions with us, inside, as a nine, outside," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No transfer fee was revealed for the former Benfica star, who made two appearances for Portugal at Euro 2024. (AFP)

    Germany goalkeeper Neuer retires from internationals

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767118_1_20240821233922.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, a 2014 World Cup winner, announced his retirement from international football on Wednesday at the age of 38.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bayern Munich veteran Neuer played 124 matches for Germany, captaining his country 61 times. His final appearance came in the quarter-final loss to eventual champions Spain at Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer wrote on social media that although he was tempted to play until the 2026 World Cup, he was "convinced that now is the right time to take this step."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He shone at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and was named as the tournament's best goalkeeper as Germany won the trophy for the fourth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer revealed he had made the announcement after discussions with his family, as well as a comprehensive conversation with Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he planned to "concentrate fully" on playing for Bayern, with whom he has won two Champions Leagues and 11 Bundesliga titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season's Champions League final will take place at Munich's Allianz Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer broke his leg in a skiing accident in December 2022 and only returned to the Germany squad just ahead of Euro 2024 on home soil, reclaiming his role as first choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great time which shaped me and of which I am very proud," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winning the World Cup title in 2014 and the special atmosphere during the European Championship at home this year are highlights for which I am extremely grateful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was an honour for me to be captain of our national team until 2023. I loved wearing the Germany jersey."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer follows fellow 2014 World Cup winners Thomas Mueller and Toni Kroos, who both played at Euro 2024, into international retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, current Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan, who missed the 2014 World Cup campaign through injury, also announced he had played his last game at international level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A product of the Schalke academy in his home town of Gelsenkirchen, Neuer made his international debut in 2009 and has more caps than any other Germany goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany won 81 of the 124 matches Neuer played in, and he kept 51 clean sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The retirement clears the way for long-time back-up Marc Andre ter Stegen of Barcelona, who is expected to take over from the Bayern captain as Germany's number one. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary golfer Gary Player, who won more than 160 professional tournaments over a career that spanned seven decades, will feature at the Fanling course in November as an ambassador of the LINK Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South African player hailed the tournament as “Asia’s Major”, marking “golf's development in China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Taichi Kho, the first player from the SAR to win on the Asian Tour, said he was excited to return to his home Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s the event I've been looking forward to the whole year and whether I play well or not, I know everyone has my back and I feel so much support from the local crowd and the Hong Kong Golf Club and everyone involved,” said Kho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think golf is a sport that comes and goes. Sometimes you score well and sometimes you don't. But I feel very proud of the fact that I've been able to stay focused all year and stay disciplined to do what I set out to do.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So it hasn't surprised me that my golf has come along nicely the second half of the year and I look forward to continuing that momentum into the final stretch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year’s champion, Ben Campbell of New Zealand, will also play to defend his title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Open will take place from November 21 to 24, featuring a prize purse of US$2 million.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students who got to meet Hong Kong's Olympians in person on Wednesday said they learnt a valuable lesson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sharing session, which followed an open-top bus parade by the athletes, took place behind closed doors inside government headquarters in Tamar and lasted about half an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlie, who trains in track and field, said she found out what it takes to become an elite athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a great opportunity for us student athletes to have a better understanding of how high, elite-level athletes, how they compete, what they prepare mentally, physically and also maybe psychologically on such a big stage, the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it's a great experience for us to know more about the profession, and also it allows us to be more motivated for our own respective sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the session, the athletes headed outdoors to meet fans who had been waiting at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey drew cheers everywhere she went, and she stopped to sign autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians then gathered on the lawn for a photo with some primary school pupils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes' packed schedule was set to continue in the afternoon with a lunch hosted by Chief Executive John Lee, followed by a joint reception by the SAR government and the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China.

 The Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics on Wednesday received a hero's welcome around town, with excited fans braving the rain to applaud the athletes on board two open-top buses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 90-minute parade featured members of the team such as Paris gold medallist and fencing queen Vivian Kong and swimming star Siobhan Haughey, who took home two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's only two-time Olympic champion, fencer Edgar Cheung, did not attend the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two buses carrying the star-studded delegation set off from the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Sha Tin and passed by Tai Wai MTR station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier, considered the best viewing locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shirley, one of hundreds of onlookers, voiced her support for the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All athletes are worthy of our attention, because everyone has to put in time and effort. Not just the champions and runners-up, but all Hong Kong athletes. They all deserve our applause," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Su was part of the enthusiastic crowds in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so excited. It was amazing. I yelled the loudest at the scene. I cheered for Vivian Kong, Siobhan Haughey, and Hong Kong. I told Vivian Kong not to cry, and to give us smiles," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dan, who's from California, said: "I think it's great. Hong Kong needs to support its athletes and its sports people more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a good way to meet the people of Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes received roaring applause as they arrived at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alice, 11, said she got an autograph from Haughey towards the end of the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that she is very perseverant. When she sets a goal, she won't give up. I also swim, so we are kind of the same person," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The athletes] did a great job and I want them to keep going and never give up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR team bagged two gold and two bronze medals at the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City forward Phil Foden won the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foden played a key role in City winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old scored 19 times and delivered eight assists for Pep Guardiola's team as they pipped Arsenal to the title on the last day of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win this award is something very special and it is one that I am very proud of and grateful for. To be recognised this way by your fellow professionals means everything and I would like to thank everyone who voted for me," Foden said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Women's T20 World Cup scheduled for October has been moved out of Bangladesh and will instead take place in the United Arab Emirates, the International Cricket Council announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision to change the venue comes after unrest that led to the overthrow of prime minister Sheikh Hasina after 15 years of iron-fisted rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 450 people were killed in the weeks of protests leading up to her August 5 ouster, most by police fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank the team at the BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) for exploring all avenues to try and enable the event to be hosted in Bangladesh," ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But travel advisories from the governments of a number of the participating teams meant that wasn't feasible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "However, they will retain hosting rights. We look forward to taking an ICC global event to Bangladesh in the near future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tournament will be staged October 3-20 across two venues in the UAE – Dubai and Sharjah. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World men's number one Jannik Sinner has been cleared of fault or negligence after failing two drug tests in March, the International Tennis Integrity Authority (ITIA) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An independent tribunal accepted Sinner's explanation that the contamination of banned substance clostebol happened when a member of his support team applied an over-the-counter spray on to treat a small wound of their own earlier this year, the ITIA said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That support team member applied the spray between 5 and 13 March, during which time they also provided daily massages and sports therapy to Sinner, resulting in unknowing transdermal contamination," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ruling is subject to appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the ITIA added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, on Tuesday recorded the first senior Grand Slam victory of his career, after beating Chile's Cristian Garin in the first qualifying round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong went a set down, 4-6, before fighting back 7-6, 6-3 for the victory against Garin, who's now ranked 116th in the world but was once as high as 17th in 2021 and made it the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China player is currently ranked 38 spots lower than the Chilean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong will next play Chinese Taipei's Hsu Yu-hsiou in the second round of qualifiers. Hsu is ranked 185th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are three rounds of qualifiers in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The draw for the main round of the men's singles will be made at Friday midnight, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Wong won the Australian Open junior doubles title two years ago.

    Sabalenka, Sinner victorious at Cincinnati Open final
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This is Sabalenka's first trophy since winning the Australian Open in January. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766839_1_20240820083919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka thrust herself into US Open title contention on Monday with a 6-3, 7-5 defeat of Jessica Pegula to win the 15th title of her career at the Cincinnati Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The third seed – who missed Wimbledon with a shoulder injury – won a trophy for the first time since collecting her second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played in the final and that I was able to get this title. It's really important going into the US Open," Sabalenka said. "I'm sure Jess and I will have more battles in the future – let's keep it up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the men's draw, world number one Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe in straight sets to secure his maiden Cincinnati Open championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner claimed his fifth victory of the season in emphatic style, swatting aside Tiafoe 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in 1hr 36min to underscore his credentials for next Monday's US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian top seed bided his time in the first set before breaking the match open in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiafoe, whose game faded after losing the first-set tiebreaker, still made an impression. The American, who moves into the ranking top-20, saved three match points before Sinner claimed his 15th career title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cincinnati is the fifth trophy of 2024 for the 23-year-old Italian, who began the season with an Australian Open title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy, this was a very difficult week," Sinner said. "It was tough mentally but I tried to do my best. I'm just glad I kept my level in the important moments. I handled the situations on court well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Sinner's third in an ATP Masters event after previous victories in Toronto and Miami. (AFP)

 Dan Lawrence will open the batting for England in the first Test of a three-match series against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, while Matthew Potts has been drafted in to compensate for the loss of captain Ben Stokes to injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawrence has only operated as an opener a handful of times in his first-class career but returns to the England side for the first time in two-and-a-half years after Zak Crawley's fractured finger opened up a vacancy at the top of the order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, 25-year-old Potts provides an extra bowling option with all-rounder Stokes set to miss the entire series after tearing his hamstring during The Hundred. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thierry Henry has decided to step down from his role as coach of the France under-21 football team, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former France international Henry made the decision after guiding the under-23 side to a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The all-time leading goalscorer for Premier League giants Arsenal took over as coach of the French youth side last summer and was under contract until June 2025 but decided to step away for "personal reasons", according to the FFF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry oversaw Les Bleuets' first run to the final of an Olympics men's tournament since winning gold in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His young side eventually went down 5-3 after extra time against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss ended a promising run that had started inauspiciously after Henry was obliged to make several changes to his squad pre-tournament, due to the refusal of certain clubs to release their players for the Games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan announced his retirement from international football on Monday after leading his country at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "After a few weeks of reflection, I have come to the conclusion that it is time to end my national team career," Gundogan said in a German FA statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look back with great pride on 82 international matches for my home country – a number that I could never have dreamed of when I made my debut for the senior national team in 2011."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan, who turns 34 in October, was in the Germany team that reached the Euro 2024 quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My highlight was clearly the huge honour of being able to lead the team as captain at our home European Championship last summer," said the Barcelona midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan made his debut for Germany against Belgium in October 2011 but missed their 2014 World Cup triumph with a back injury. He was also ruled out of Euro 2016 due to a dislocated kneecap. (AFP)

 Equestrian athlete Natasha Tse left for Britain on Monday for two final weeks of training ahead of the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Growing up with cerebral palsy, which hinders movement and muscle control, Tse embraced horse-riding at a young age of four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making her Paralympic debut in London at just 15, the veteran is gearing up for her fourth Games in early September, where she'll be competing in the individual para dressage event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this time, Tse is bringing two “horses”. Check out our video to find out why.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé was left frustrated on his Real Madrid La Liga debut on Sunday as a resilient Real Mallorca held the Spanish and European champions to a 1-1 draw in their title defence opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French superstar was thwarted by Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif and after Rodrygo Goes sent Madrid ahead early on the hosts levelled in the second half through Vedat Muriqi's towering header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's star-studded side struggled to break down Mallorca, who came closer to winning the game in the final stages at Son Moix stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Los Blancos defender Ferland Mendy was sent off in stoppage time for a high challenge on Muriqi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We went ahead, we had chances to score the second, and then in the second half we lacked balance," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We conceded counter-attacks, it was not a good game, it was quite a clear game to see that we need to defend better and have better balance on the pitch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti selected the same starting line-up which defeated Atalanta to win the Uefa Super Cup on Thursday, with Jude Bellingham in midfield behind the Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo attacking line.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma won her first women's Tour de France title by just four seconds on Sunday as she dug in during the race's gruelling final Alpine ascent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Canyon SRAM rider summited the daunting Alpe d'Huez mountain one minute one second behind stage winner Demi Vollering to maintain her grip on the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so crazy to be honest, the whole stage was such a crazy rollercoaster," said a visibly emotional Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've gone through such a terrible time on this climb, like I hated everything, then to arriving at the finish line and learning that I won Tour de France, which is insane. It's so mind-blowing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour was turned upside down on Thursday during the fifth stage when Vollering was caught up in a huge crash six kilometres from the finish in Amneville, losing 1min 47sec on the leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After third-placed finishes in the previous two Tours and a disappointing eighth-place finish at the 2024 Olympic Games road race, the victory tasted even sweeter for Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think last year's third place was there to reward me with this victory and same as two weeks ago I was so disappointed getting stuck behind a crash during the Olympics," said the Limanowa-native.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like during this week, all the stars aligned for my team and for myself." (AFP)

    Man City beat Chelsea to start title defence

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former Chelsea favourite Mateo Kovacic, (centre), beats Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez at his near post. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766678_1_20240819022912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City got their Premier League title defence off to a winning start as goals from Erling Haaland and Mateo Kovacic inflicted a 2-0 defeat on Enzo Maresca in his first match in charge of Chelsea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haaland marked his 100th appearance for the club with his 91st goal before Kovacic struck on his return to Stamford Bridge to give Pep Guardiola's men the perfect start to their attempt to win a record fifth consecutive English top-flight title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were shorn of all four of their Euro 2024 finalists – Rodri, Kyle Waker, John Stones and Phil Foden – from the start as Guardiola opted to give them extra time off to recover from their summer exertions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the champions were still able to lay down a marker against one of the few sides they failed to beat in the league last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca has the tough task of moulding a functioning team unit from a bloated Chelsea squad that has 43 players and over 50 on the books including those on loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consequences of those difficult decisions played out even before kick-off as Raheem Sterling's camp released a statement expressing his dismay at being left out of the matchday squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Chilwell was another to face the cull, while Conor Gallagher and Romelu Lukaku are among those not to have been handed squad numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  None of Chelsea's nine summer signings to date were included in Maresca's starting line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even more surprisingly, Enzo Fernandez was named captain despite being embroiled in a race row for a post on social media after Argentina's Copa America victory last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City, by contrast, are a model of continuity and consistent excellence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland was one of City's few stars to have had a summer off from international tournaments and took just 18 minutes to make his mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeremy Doku's low cross was deflected by Bernardo Silva into the Norwegian's path and he coolly dinked over Robert Sanchez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne curled inches wide and Sanchez leapt high to turn over Doku's deflected shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chelsea ended the first half in the ascendency and should have been level before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ederson spilled Cole Palmer's tame shot but was bailed out by Nicolas Jackson's straying needlessly offside before he turned in the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden was forced into action earlier than Guardiola would have hoped at half-time as the lively Savinho was forced off injured on his Premier League debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lack of pre-season minutes for many on show was apparent in the more pedestrian pace than normal for a major Premier League clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea did most of the pressing for an equaliser but offered City chances to extend their lead in doing so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made a fine save to deny Haaland a second before De Bruyne again fired inches off target when unmarked at the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Chelsea goalkeeper was at fault for the goal that sealed their fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kovacic was allowed to burst through the midfield unchallenged and took aim for the top corner, which he found thanks to a weak hand from Sanchez. (AFP)

    Toney-less Brentford get the better of Crystal Palace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brentford's Mark Flekken can only watch as Palace's equaliser rolls in. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766671_1_20240818233029.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brentford shrugged off the absence of Ivan Toney to get their Premier League season off to a flying start with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa got the goals for the Bees, who had left out England international Toney over speculation surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toney has less than a year left to run on his contract with the London club and is attracting interest from Saudi clubs after his role in helping England to the Euro 2024 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford boss Thomas Frank said pre-match his side had shown last season they can cope without Toney – who missed much of last term due to a betting ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guehi did captain Crystal Palace despite the interest in him shown by Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England defender had an outstanding Euros but a moment to forget for Brentford's opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbeumo raced onto Wissa's pass and cut inside Guehi before firing into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palace ended last season in sensational form under Oliver Glasner and will feel hard done by not to have earned at least a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eberechi Eze had a brilliantly executed near post free-kick harshly ruled out for a foul by Will Hughes when the score was still level at 0-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bright Palace start to the second half was rewarded when Ethan Pinnock turned Daniel Munoz's header into his own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seconds later, Odsonne Edouard slotted home Eze's pass only to be denied by a marginal offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was Brentford who grabbed the vital third goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dean Henderson could only parry Nathan Collins' shot straight into the path of Wissa, who bundled home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eze was twice denied by Mark Flekken in the closing stages but Brentford held out for an impressive three points. (AFP)

    Liverpool brush aside Ipswich, Arsenal beat Wolves

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Liverpool manager Arne Slot and first team individual development coach Aaron Briggs watch the game. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766596_1_20240817223239.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot got off to a winning start as Liverpool manager with a 2-0 win at newly-promoted Ipswich on Saturday as Arsenal began their Premier League title challenge by beating Wolves by the same scoreline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newcastle defied an early red card for Fabian Schar to edge past Southampton 1-0, while Brighton ran riot under new manager Fabian Hurzeler in a 3-0 victory at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot has huge shoes to fill at Anfield after the departure of Jurgen Klopp, who restored the Reds to the top of the English game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman was left less than impressed by his side's first 45 minutes at Portman Road as Ipswich flew out of the traps on their return to the Premier League for the first time in 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Liverpool were a different side after the break as goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah barely reflected their dominance to get Slot off to the perfect start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We as a team made a big change at half-time because we came out totally different to how we had come out in the first half," said the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second half, we won more duels, we won more second balls and we played more balls in behind because if the other team takes the risk of playing one-v-one and you have the likes of Luis Diaz, Mo Salah and Diogo Jota then use them, play the balls in behind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have finished second to Manchester City in each of the past two seasons and are highly-fancied to be the champions' closest challengers again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kai Havertz opened the scoring at the Emirates from Bukayo Saka's cross to reward the Gunners' early dominance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men needed a vital save from David Raya to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen and Matheus Cunha missed a huge chance to level before Arsenal made the points safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The roles from the first goal were reversed as this time Havertz teed up Saka to lash home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's hopes of a winning start to the season looked to have been undone when Schar was sent off after just 28 minutes for what the referee deemed a headbutt on Ben Brereton Diaz despite limited contact between the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton had dominated even the early exchanges against the Magpies' full compliment but failed to convert from 19 shots and nearly 80 percent possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Newcastle were clinical as Alexander Isak teed up Joelinton for the only goal just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's final season at Goodison Park got off to a nightmare start as 31-year-old Hurzeler enjoyed a dream start to life in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaoru Mitoma fired Brighton in front on his return from injury that saw the Japanese international miss much of last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Welbeck added a second after the break before Everton were reduced to 10 men when Ashley Young saw red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Adingra made it 3-0 late on and only a VAR review denied Brighton a fourth through Yasin Ayari.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Semenyo stepped into the void left at Bournemouth by the departure of Dominic Solanke with a late equaliser to salvage a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City begin their defence of the title in the standout fixture of the weekend at Chelsea on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766577_1_20240817171721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand thumped Argentina 42-10 on Saturday as Will Jordan grabbed two of their six tries in The Rugby Championship to avenge last week's shock defeat by the Pumas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Damian McKenzie scored 17 points in Auckland as the All Blacks defied wet conditions in a skilled attacking display to maintain their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was vast improvement on the 38-30 loss in Wellington last week, with an explosive first-half performance pushing the hosts 35-3 ahead through five converted tries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was built on a dominant display from the forwards, who heeded the call for "redemption" issued to them by coach Scott Robertson after they were outplayed a week earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina's scrum was overpowered and they weren't the same force at the breakdown in a performance punctuated by mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their lone try came late in the match to fullback Juan Cruz Mallia, meaning the second half was drawn 7-7, helped by tighter defence from the visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was New Zealand's best performance under first-year coach Robertson in his fifth match in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory continued New Zealand's remarkable record in Auckland, where they've won 50 Tests since their last defeat, against France in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed all his six conversion attempts and his general play was superior to the first Test, mixing an astute long kicking game with some clever chips to counter the Pumas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The playmaker also opened the scoring with a try after pouncing on a chip from Jordie Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santiago Carreras responded with a Pumas penalty goal before New Zealand captain Ardie Savea powered over for his 27th Test try -- lifting him level with former skipper Richie McCaw for the most by an All Blacks forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Caleb Clarke and Jordan were both put into space for tries -- the latter capitalising on a blindside break from scrum-half TJ Perenara.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie's sweetly timed pass put Beauden Barrett across just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan continued the rout soon after the break, lifting him to 33 tries in as many Tests in his first starting appearance since last year's World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game entered a lull before Mallia's try and a late yellow card was shown to All Blacks hooker Asafo Aumua for a high tackle. (AFP)

    Manchester United see off Fulham after shaky start

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766529_1_20240817053109.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joshua Zirkzee made himself a Manchester United hero on his debut with a late winner to beat Fulham 1-0 in the opening match of the Premier League season on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, lacking match fitness after his move from Bologna last month, came on only for the final half hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch international saved the Red Devils from a frustrating evening at Old Trafford when he poked in Alejandro Garnacho's cross on 87 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn't be better," said Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been told (scoring at the Stretford End) is one of the best feelings at Manchester United. I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United boss Erik ten Hag survived at the end of last season, despite finishing eighth in the Premier League, thanks to winning the FA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether that shock victory over rivals and English champions Manchester City in May could be a springboard remains to be seen after a performance that was eerily reminiscent of many last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag said on the eve of the game that his side were "not ready" for the new campaign with key players missing through injury or a lack of match fitness, and it showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Fernandes started in a centre-forward role in the absence of Rasmus Hojlund, while Zirkzee was on the bench after returning to pre-season late following Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noussair Mazraoui was thrown straight into the starting line-up at left-back after joining from Bayern Munich this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was no place in the squad for Jadon Sancho even though the winger and Ten Hag appeared to have settled their differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fulham won at Old Trafford last season for the first time in 20 years in February during a torrid campaign for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Little seemed to have changed in the opening 20 minutes as the visitors started confidently and Andre Onana did well to prevent Kenny Tete's dipping effort finding the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fulham were nearly masters of their own downfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro pounced on Bernd Leno's sloppy pass and teed up Fernandes, who could only fire straight at Fulham's German goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro's struggles played a large part in United's problems last season, but the Brazilian started the new campaign more like his old self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An incisive through ball from the former Real Madrid midfielder created another brilliant chance for Fernandes, who again could not beat Leno from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's lack of a predatory striker continued to haunt them after the break as Leno spread himself brilliantly to this time deny Mason Mount a rare goal since his move from Chelsea just over a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag turned to Garnacho and Zirkzee from the bench in the search of a winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In doing so United left themselves open and Fulham could have secured another famous three points at the Theatre of Dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreas Pereira's poor pass cost Alex Iwobi the chance to run clean through on goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments later Lisandro Martinez produced a goal-saving clearance from Pereira's dangerous low cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was the home side that snatched all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho's ball from the right was not the best, but Zirkzee managed to get a toe on it to divert it beyond Leno into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United should have had a second in stoppage time when Garnacho somehow skewed wide with an open goal to aim at from Marcus Rashford's unselfish pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But United held on to give Ten Hag the winning start he badly needed. (AFP)

 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

    'Raygun' hits back at critics of her Olympic routine

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael Gunn said the backlash to her much-ridiculed Olympic performance has been “devastating,” adding she took the competition seriously and gave her best effort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old b-girl, known as "Raygun", said in a video posted to social media that she wasn’t prepared for the level of negative attention she has received since judges awarded her zero points in her Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) criticised an anonymous online petition attacking the Paris Games competitor, saying it was “vexatious, misleading and bullying.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympic debut in Paris, and one of the lasting images was the performance of Gunn, a 36-year-old university professor from Sydney — who did a “kangaroo dance” among other questionable moves during her routine — and did not receive a single point from any of the nine judges in either round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn was subsequently mocked for her efforts, including a parody on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in the United States. In the video, she said she was subjected to abuse that went beyond criticism of her dance moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’d really like to ask the press to please stop harassing my family, my friends, the Australian breaking community and the broader street dance community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn, who has not yet returned to Australia, received strong support from Australian Olympic team leader Anna Meares while in Paris. On Thursday, the AOC went a step further, taking aim at what it called erroneous material published online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief executive officer Matt Carroll said the the AOC had written to Change.org, which had published a petition criticising Gunn and the AOC, demanding that it be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 people had signed the petition claiming Gunn had “manipulated” Olympic qualification processes. The petition appeared to have been removed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carroll said the petition “contained numerous falsehoods designed to engender hatred against an athlete who was selected in the Australian Olympic team through a transparent and independent qualification event and nomination process.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking at the Olympics might have been one-and-done in Paris. The sport is not on the competition list for Los Angeles in 2028, and also is unlikely to appear in 2032 at Brisbane, Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online criticism of Gunn this past week has included suggestions the Oceania qualifying event held in Sydney last October was set up to favour her, and questioned the judging that allowed Gunn to qualify .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AOC said Thursday the Oceania qualifying event was conducted under the Olympic qualification system determined by the international governing body, the World DanceSport Federation, and approved by International Olympic Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unattributed social media comments also suggested Gunn and her husband, fellow breaker Samuel Free, had held positions within Australian breaking organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Rachael Gunn holds no position with AUSBreaking or DanceSport Australia in any capacity,” the AOC said Thursday. “She is simply an athlete who competed in the qualifying event which she won.” (AP)
