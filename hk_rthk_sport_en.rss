  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wheelchair fencers kicked off their campaign in the French capital, but had relatively brief stints on the piste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six-time Paralympian Alison Yu earned a bye in the round of 32 as the 10th seed of the women's sabre category A.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The classification is for fencers with good sitting balance and impairments affecting their lower limbs.
  <br/>

   <br/>
   The 40-year-old made a winning start in the last 16, but was beaten 4-15 by Georgia's Nino Tibilashvili in the quarter-final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yu fell into the repechages, where she was eliminated by Gemma Collis of Great Britain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She admitted sabre wasn't her strong suit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My goal before the event was simply to win one match. I’ve achieved it by winning the first match," the seven-time gold medallist said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Later on, my swordsmanship was a bit lacking compared to other players. What's good about the day was that I could adapt to the venue and the cheers of the audience. I also saw many friends from Hong Kong in the crowd showing their support."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fan Pui-shan was also sent packing from the women's sabre, after being edged out by South Korea's Kwon Hyo-kyeong in the round of 32.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 49-year-old fencer lost 8-15 in category A.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For me, I treated the sabre competition as a warm-up match, because sabre fencing isn't my strong suit. I mainly enjoyed it and got the feel of things," she said.
   <br/>

    In category B for fencers with an impairment that impacts their sitting balance or fencing arm, Tong Nga-ting was unable to advance after she was beaten by her South Korean rival in the repechage.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The SAR fencers now look ahead to the foil competitions.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Natasha Tse was placed 15th out of 22 entrants in the grade one individual championship test.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Only the top eight riders progressed to the individual freestyle event.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tse competed with her new horse, Juno's Whispering Angel.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The four-time Paralympian said she's still figuring out how to team up well with her new partner.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "We've worked together about a dozen times over the past few months. We're still getting the hang of things. Its performance is okay, but there's plenty of room for improvement. When I was preparing for the Paralympics, I hurt my waist, but I pushed through to finish the competition," Tse said.

 Taylor Fritz won a big-hitting battle with Alexander Zverev to reach his first Grand Slam semi-final at the US Open on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 12th-seeded Fritz came through against the fourth-seeded 2020 runner-up 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) and will face either American compatriot Frances Tiafoe or Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria for a place in Sunday's final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have had a few looks at Grand Slam quarter-finals over the years so I felt it was my turn to take a step further," said the 26-year-old Fritz who cracked 12 aces amongst his 45 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've always had a big serve but at the top of the game it comes back a lot more," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zverev's defeat means world number one Jannik Sinner is the only top-four player left in the draw following the shock early exits of Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. (AFP)

    Oilers extend Leon Draisaitl's contract for US$112mn

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Edmonton Oilers have signed Leon Draisaitl to an eight-year contract extension worth US$112 million, a deal that gives the German star the highest salary cap hit in NHL history at US$14 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new contract begins with the 2025-26 season and runs through 2033. General manager Stan Bowman announced the extension on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a historic day for the Edmonton Oilers," Bowman said. "Leon’s commitment to our team, our city and Oilers fans everywhere cannot be overstated. His desire to help bring a Stanley Cup title home to Edmonton is central to everything he does both on and off the ice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Draisaitl and Connor McDavid helped the team reach Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final this past year. Draisaitl, the league’s MVP in 2020, was set to be an unrestricted free agent next summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Getting Draisaitl signed was the biggest task of the Oilers' offseason. Bowman was hired as GM in late July, weeks after being reinstated by the league office following a ban for his role in the Chicago Blackhawks 2010 sexual assault allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Draisaitl surpasses Auston Matthews' US$13.25 million cap hit with this new contract, which nearly doubles his salary. The 28-year-old Draisaitl is making US$8.5 million on average on his current contract, which was signed in 2017 and became one of the most team friendly in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big forward from Cologne has been worth every penny, putting up 850 points in 719 regular-season games since making his NHL debut and being one of the top producers in playoff history with 108 in 74. Draisaitl's 1.46 points a game rank fourth all time among players with 40-plus games in the postseason behind Hall of Famers Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and McDavid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With this contract done, the Oilers can turn their attention to re-signing McDavid, their captain, face of the franchise and reigning playoff MVP. He could be a free agent in the summer of 2026 and is eligible to sign a contract extension July 1. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Uruguay icon Luis Suarez announced his retirement from international football on Monday, confirming that the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Paraguay will be his last international match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Friday will be my last match for my country," an emotional Suarez, 37, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was not an easy decision to make, but I do it with the peace of mind that I will give my maximum until the very last game of my Uruguay career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Barcelona and Liverpool striker is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation and will retire from international football as Uruguay's top scorer with 69 goals from 142 appearances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suarez, who was infamously kicked out of the 2014 World Cup after being handed a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini, made his debut for Uruguay in 2007.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Inter Miami forward helped Uruguay capture the 2011 Copa America, where he was named player of the tournament, and would eventually represent the South American country in nine major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suarez said Monday that inspiring Uruguay to that Copa crown had been the highpoint of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wouldn't trade the Copa America title for anything," he said. "It was the best moment of my career. I wouldn't trade it for anything." (AFP/Reuters)

   Four-time Paralympian John Loung kicked off a medal spree for the SAR at the men's boccia individual BC1 final.

   The 38-year-old took a commanding lead after three ends against South Korea's Jung Sungjoon, and held on for a 4-1 victory.

    <br/>
    "This gold medal isn't just for me. It's for everyone who helped me and for all the audience," she said.

     "I am not very satisfied with my overall performance ... I was too nervous, so I wasn't playing as freely as I should, but I am still very happy to be able to win a silver medal," Cheung said as she looked ahead to the mixed pairs competition.

     Wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan finished on the podium for the second straight Games, this time winning a silver as he lowered the curtain for his illustrious career.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 39-year-old veteran was beaten by world number one Japanese Daiki Kajiwara in straight games of 10-21 in the men's singles WH2.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The result was still one step better than his bronze-medal finish in Tokyo three years ago.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Speaking after the match, a tearful Chan said waist pain affected his performance.
     <br/>

     "I really put in a lot of effort. Before the competition, my waist was so painful that I couldn't even turn around. I had to ask the therapist for help, and take medication," he revealed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I want to compete like a 20-year-old, but I haven't been able to do that in recent years."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But there was heartbreak for fellow SAR shuttler Chu Man-kai, who missed out on a medal after losing to his Brazil's Vitor Tavares 2-1 in the men's singles SH6 bronze medal match.

     Leung Chung-yan concluded his Paralympic debut when he was beaten in the last 16 of the men's singles MS11 by Peter Palos of Hungary.
     <br/>

     In the women's, Ng Mui-wui also bowed out after losing to her Brazilian opponent 3-0 in the WS11 singles round of 16.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany men's football coach Julian Nagelsmann said Monday he had tapped Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich to take over as national team captain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kimmich was a "role model for the whole group", Nagelsmann said at a press conference ahead of Germany's Nations League fixture against Hungary in Duesseldorf on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He always gives his all, he always wants to train – sometimes too much – he is never tired, he always wants to win," Nagelsmann said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich, 29, was "number one" in a player leadership group alongside Real Madrid defender Antonio Ruediger and Arsenal striker Kai Havertz, Nagelsmann said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three had a "good connection" with the rest of the squad, the coach added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich takes over from Ilkay Gundogan, who captained Germany at Euro 2024 on home soil before retiring from international football in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kimmich has served as vice-captain of Germany since September 2023, having been promoted to the role behind Gundogan by former coach Hansi Flick, and is one of the country's most experienced players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The midfielder will be tasked with leading a new generation of German footballers, with Gundogan as well as 2014 World Cup winners Toni Kroos, Thomas Mueller and Manuel Neuer all retiring from international duty in recent weeks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wheelchair badminton star Daniel Chan has wrapped up his illustrious career by collecting a silver medal for Hong Kong, China at the Paralympic Games in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old veteran insisted he was proud of his performance, despite not being at his best on the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two came up short against Daiki Kajiwara, the top seed from Japan, losing 10-21, 10-21 in the men's singles WH2 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was still one step better than his bronze-medal finish in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, a tearful Chan revealed lower back pain hampered his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I really put in a lot of effort. Before the competition, my waist was so painful that I couldn't even turn around. I had to ask the therapist for help, and take medications," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to compete like a 20-year-old, but I haven't been able to do that in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stood by his decision to hang up his racquet, saying he wanted to have a good rest and recuperate from the "tormenting" chronic spasms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was heartbreak for fellow SAR shuttler Chu Man-kai, who missed out on a medal after losing to Brazil's Vitor Tavares 21-23, 21-16, 12-21 in the men's singles SH6 bronze medal match.

 Third-time Paralympian Ho Yuen-kei clinched another gold medal for Hong Kong, China, at the South Paris Arena. She defeated her Australian opponent 4-2 in the boccia women's individual B-C-3 final.

  Ho said the gold medal belongs to everyone.

  "It’s for everyone who helped me...I hope our 23 athletes at the Paralympics in France show that we aren’t doing well just because we have disabilities and work hard. We want to send a message that we’re all the same and share the Hong Kong spirit of never giving up."

 Former champion Daniil Medvedev reached his fifth US Open quarter-final in six years on Monday with a straight-sets victory over unseeded Nuno Borges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Medvedev, the 2021 winner in New York, outclassed Borges, who was bidding to become the first Portuguese man to make a Grand Slam quarter-final, 6-0, 6-1, 6-3.
  <br/>

  Russia's Medvedev will meet Jannik Sinner for a place in the semi-finals if the world number one Italian defeats Tommy Paul of the United States in his last-16 clash in the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I played Tommy twice this season. I beat him once but I feel as if he should have beaten me both times," said Medvedev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had unbelievable battles with Jannik. It will be very physical for both of us."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR boccia athlete Annie Cheung on Monday added a silver medal for Hong Kong, China in the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paralympic debutant, 25, was defeated by China's Lin Ximei 5-1 in the women's individual BC4 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin scored a point in each of the first two ends for a 2-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the third end, a series of miscues by Cheung widened the gap, with Lin scoring three more times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung picked up one point in the fourth and final end but it was not enough to overcome the deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's victory in the final avenged her loss to Cheung in their inaugural pool match in the preliminary round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not very satisfied with my overall performance, especially in the final. I was too nervous, so I wasn't playing as freely as I should. But I am still very happy to be able to win a silver medal," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I try to regroup as quickly as possible... and I hope to achieve good results in the mixed pairs event."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will compete in the boccia's mixed pairs event alongside six-time Paralympian Leung Yuk-wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Cheung on winning the silver medal, praising her for staying resilient against the world's best athletes throughout the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, SAR table tennis player Leung Chung-yan ended his Paralympic debut when he was beaten in the last 16 of the men's MS-11 singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost 6-11, 11-8, 6-11 and 6-11 to Peter Palos of Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team have now captured one gold, two silvers and a bronze at the Paris Paralympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR boccia player John Loung on Monday won Hong Kong's first gold medal in the Paris Paralympics, bowling his way to victory in the men's individual BC1 final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Loung, who is competing in his fourth Paralympics, beat Jung Sung-joon of South Korea 4-1 to reach the top of the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete went ahead by scoring two points in end one, and then added a point in each of the next two ends, before Jung responded with a point in the final end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Loung cheered and waved to the crowd after his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on behalf of Loung after the match, his coach Marco Lau said the athlete did not think it was possible to reach the final, let alone win a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Loung also paid tribute to his coaches as well as veteran boccia star Leung Yuk-wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to our head coach, Kwok [Hart-wing], and other coaches who have helped me a lot. And also, thank you to Leung Yuk-wing, for assisting his teammates quite a bit in their training," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee congratulated Loung on winning gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "John Loung demonstrated unwavering determination and superb skills in the competition, claiming the first gold medal for the Hong Kong, China Delegation at this year's Paralympic Games," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His gold medal is well-deserved. All Hong Kong people and I are thrilled and proud of his outstanding performance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR has won three medals at the Paralympics so far, which include a silver and bronze in swimming.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen reached the US Open quarter-finals for a second time with victory over Donna Vekic in a record late finish for a women's match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The encounter finished at 2:15am New York time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seventh-seed Zheng won 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 6-2 against her 24th-ranked Croatian opponent who she also defeated in the Paris Olympics final four weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng will face Aryna Sabalenka next in what will be an Australian Open final rematch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At two o' clock in the morning, this is unbelievable. Thank you to the fans for not sleeping tonight and supporting me here," Zheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donna is really tough to play in hard court. She put me in a lot of pressure. In France I was totally in control but today she hit really aggressive, it was really tough but a nice victory for me and I enjoyed it." (Agencies)

  Ng returned to the pool one night after finishing sixth in the women's SM6 200 metres individual medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paralympic debutant was second at the halfway mark of the SB6 100 metres breaststroke final, before being leapfrogged by China's world-record holder, Liu Daomin, towards the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng touched the wall at 1:34.15, nearly two seconds behind Liu for bronze, while Britain's Maisie Summers-Newton retained her gold.

   At 14 years and five months old, Ng is now Hong Kong's youngest-ever Para medallist.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She refreshed the previous record set by legendary sprinter So Wa-wai, who was 14 years and 10 months old when he bagged his maiden Paralympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking after the race, Ng has set her sights on improving her stamina.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm happy I finished the event and won the second medal for team Hong Kong. For the last 25 metres, I couldn't maintain my pace. When I return to Hong Kong after the Paralympics, I hope to train harder and give my best in another competition," she said.

    Ng will have another crack at a medal on Saturday at the women's S6 100 metres backstroke.

    Elsewhere in the pool, SAR swimmers Chan Yui-lam, Cheung Ho-ying, Andy Cheung and Tang Wai-lok barely missed out on a medal in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay S14, finishing fourth.

    Great Britain took gold, Australia silver and Brazil rounded off the podium.

    Third-time Paralympian Ho Yuen-kei booked her place in the final after overcoming her South Korean opponent 4-1 in the women's individual BC3.
    <br/>

Many messaged me on Instagram or left comments, telling me they set an alarm to wake up and watch us play. I thank you very much for supporting Paralympians. It hasn't been easy for you," Ho said.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Debutant Annie Cheung also breezed her way to the gold medal match, after beating her Malaysian rival 7-0 in the women's individual BC4.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On the men's side, John Loung will be fighting for gold as well after defeating his opponent from Indonesia 4-3 in the men's individual BC1 semi-final.

    Liverpool beat Man Utd to maintain perfect Slot start

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot passed his first major examination as Liverpool manager with a statement 3-0 win at Manchester United thanks to Luis Diaz's double and a Mohamed Salah strike on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slot has the unenviable task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp but has made a perfect start with a 100 percent record from three Premier League games to sit alongside Manchester City at the top of the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think everything you want to see as a manager you saw in this game," said Slot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second consecutive defeat leaves United boss Erik ten Hag already under pressure just three games into the new season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman survived an internal review at the end of last season after overseeing the club's worst ever Premier League finish of eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But all the hallmarks of United's failings last season were exposed by the impressive visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not like I'm Harry Potter," said Ten Hag."We just had a third game in the season and again we have to build a new team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will be fine," he added. "It's clear we have to improve but at the end of the season I'm quite confident that we will have a big chance to lift another trophy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Liverpool's ascendency over United during Klopp's reign, the German managed to win only two of his 11 away games against United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time Liverpool were ruthless and could easily have matched their record 5-0 victory away to United in 2021. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Coco Gauff was knocked out of the US Open in the fourth round on Sunday by American compatriot Emma Navarro after a serving horror show.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 13th-seeded Navarro took advantage of third-ranked Gauff's 19 double faults and 60 unforced errors to win 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 and set up a quarter-final against Spain's Paula Badosa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not the summer that I want," said Gauff who exited Wimbledon in the fourth round and suffered early losses at the Olympics, Toronto and Cincinnati.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I feel like there's 70 other players in the draw that would love to have the summer that I had even though it's probably my least well done during this time of the year," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff's defeat means that Serena Williams remains the last woman to successfully defend the US Open title back in 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Navarro had defeated Gauff at Wimbledon in July and was dominant again on Sunday from the outset. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Grigor Dimitrov returned to the US Open quarter-finals for the first time since 2019 with a five-set triumph over Andrey Rublev on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ninth seed Dimitrov came through 6-3, 7-6 (7/3), 1-6, 3-6, 6-3 to set up a clash with either Frances Tiafoe of the United States or Alexei Popyrin, the conqueror of Novak Djokovic, for a place in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old Dimitrov made the semi-finals in 2019 where he was defeated by Daniil Medvedev having stunned five-time champion Roger Federer in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was playing fairly good," said Dimitrov, the oldest player left in the men's draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But for some reason my body got tired a little bit and he wasn't going to give up the match. I had stay patient. I think the biggest thing today was my experience."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dimitrov saved 13 of 18 break points in the match and credited long-time friend and six-time women's champion Serena Williams for a helping hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She gave me a good pep talk yesterday," he said of the US tennis legend who was watching the match in Arthur Ashe Stadium. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Teenage swimmer Jasmine Ng clinched her first Paralympic bronze medal for Hong Kong, China, in the women’s 100m breaststroke SB6 event, becoming the youngest Hong Kong Paralympic medallist.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old touched home in a time of 1:34.15, less than three seconds behind British Maisie Summers-Newton who smashed the Paralympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Daomin took silver for the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng is now Hong Kong's youngest-ever Para medallist, refreshing the previous record set by legendary sprinter So Wa-wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 14 years and five months old, she is five months younger than So when he took home his first Paralympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the race, the teenager has set her sights on improving her stamina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy I finished the event and won the second medal for team Hong Kong. For the last 25 metres, I couldn't maintain my pace. When I return to Hong Kong after the Paralympics, I hope to train harder and give my best in another competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the final of the mixed 4-by-100m Freestyle Relay S14, the SAR team of Chan Yui-lam, Cheung Ho-ying, Andy Cheung and Tang Wai-lok finished fourth out of five, clocking a time of 3:55.20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain took gold, Australia bagged silver and Brazil rounded off the podium.

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768627_1_20240901233429.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Charles Leclerc won the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday to delight Ferrari's massed ranks of fans as Lando Norris again chipped away at struggling champion Max Verstappen's lead in the Formula One drivers' standings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Monegasque Leclerc claimed victory at Monza for the second time after winning in 2019, holding off McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Norris in a thrilling race in which Verstappen finished nearly 38 seconds off the pace in sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huge roars engulfed the stands as Leclerc took the chequered flag after holding out on a set of hard tyres he had changed in his one and only pit stop on the 16th lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of his major rivals, apart from teammate Carlos Sainz who ended up finishing fourth, pitted twice and McLaren were hoping that the Ferrari pair would do the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But instead Leclerc managed to keep his tyres in good enough condition to stay ahead and in the end finish the race comfortably in front of Piastri, who had taken the race lead early on after a daring overtake manoeuvre on Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briton Norris, who clocked the fastest lap right at the end, will be disappointed by his finish after starting on pole but he managed to chop Verstappen's championship lead to 62 points with eight races remaining as his Dutch rival's barren run continued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has now failed to win any of the last six GPs after claiming the honours in seven of the first 10, and his and Red Bull's dominance of F1 looks increasingly in question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth straight world title looked a near certainty when Verstappen won in Spain back in June, but since then he has only finished on the podium twice. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Erling Haaland terrorises the West Ham defence again as City take top spot in the Premier League. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768543_1_20240901033649.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland's second successive hat-trick earned Premier League champions Manchester City a 3-1 win at West Ham United on Saturday, while Everton suffered a painful 3-2 home loss to Bournemouth and Aston Villa returned to winning ways as goals by Amadou Onana and Jhon Duran secured a 2-1 victory at Leicester City.
 <br>
  <br/>
  City opened up an early two-point lead over last season's runners-up Arsenal, with Haaland following up last week's treble against Ipswich Town to record his seventh goal in three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian calmly slotted past Alphonse Areola to put City ahead and, after West Ham equalised against the run of play through Ruben Dias' own goal, Haaland restored City's lead on the half-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland secured the win with another cool finish in the 83rd minute, charging on to Matheus Nunes' through ball and lifting his shot over substitute keeper Lukasz Fabianski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We played really well, it was an unfortunate goal against," City boss Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports. "The second half was more open but we controlled it better and the performance is good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Officially, the pre-season is now over. We played one game a week and it was a super season. Now they play two a week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton, under pressure after two league losses, opened up a 2-0 lead over Bournemouth in a seven-minute spell after the break through goals from Michael Keane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth spent most of the game on the back foot, but with three minutes left they pulled a goal back when Antoine Semenyo poked home from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In added time, Lewis Cook's powerful header found the back of the net and Luis Sinisterra broke Everton hearts with the winner to leave the hosts rooted to the bottom of the table, booed by their own supporters at full time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After leading 2-0 goals until the 87th minute, Everton's defeat was the latest a team has ever been two or more goals ahead in a Premier League game they have gone on to lose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really let ourselves down in front of our fans," Everton captain Seamus Coleman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Villa's summer signing Onana touched in from close range after a clever free kick routine in the 28th minute to give his side the lead against Leicester. Hosts Leicester were more of a threat in the second half but Duran's 63rd-minute header proved decisive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford shrugged off the loss of star striker Ivan Toney as Bryan Mbeumo's double and a goal by Yoane Wissa earned a comfortable 3-1 home win over promoted Southampton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow promoted side Ipswich Town were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Fulham and Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers played out a 1-1 draw at the City Ground. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China's badminton and boccia players closed in on medals at the Paris Paralympics late on Saturday, though two swimming finalists missed out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In badminton, Daniel Chan, a bronze medalist in Tokyo, will take on South Korea's Yu Sooyoung in the semi-final of the men's WH2 on Sunday after comfortably topping his group by beating rivals from Chile and Malaysia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chu Man-kai, the top seed in the men's SH6 competition after taking silver in Tokyo, won all three pool games to earn himself a bye through the quarter-finals. He beat opponents from Britain, India and Indonesia to top Group A, and will go again in tonight's semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two women's boccia players also secured semi-final places in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After topping her group in the women's individual BC4, Annie Cheung took control of her quarter-final, beating Laissa Polyana Teixeira of Brazil 4-1. Cheung is at her first Paralympics and next takes on  Malaysia's Noor Askuzaimey Mat Salim in the semi-final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Yuen-kei had to come from behind to win her BC3 quarter-final against Kla-Han Ladamanee of Thailand, scoring twice in the final end to seal a 3-2 victory. She next faces Kang Sunhee for a place in the final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmers Tang Wai-lok and Andy Cheung missed out in the final of the men's  S14 200m freestyle, as Britain's William Ellard smashed the world record to take gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who won gold in the same event in the Rio 2016 Games, finished seventh while Cheung, who is making his Paralympic debut at the age of 19, finished eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ellard dominated from start to finish, taking more than a second off the record with a time of 1min 51.30 seconds. Nicholas Bennett of Canada and Australia's Jack Ireland took silver and bronze respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's Chan Yui-lam and Cheung Ho-ying bowed out in the semi-finals of the equivalent women's event. The S14 category is for swimmers with intellectual disabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang will be back in action in the S14 100m backstroke and the SM14 200m medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's sole para athletics representative, Yam Kwok-fan, missed out on a place in the final of the women's T36 200 metres, finishing fifth in her heat. She's got the 100m coming up later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in boccia, Hong Kong's Leung Yuk-wing saw his campaign end at the quarter-final stage in the men's individual BC4 event. After finishing second in his group, he was beaten 6-1 by Britain's Stephen McGuire in the early hours of Sunday. He'll be back later in the mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BC2 competition, Yeung Hiu-lam was beaten by Britain's Claire Taggart 3-2 in the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Sunday, John Loung of Hong Kong takes on Huadpradit Witsanu of Thailand in men's BC1 quarter-final.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Declan Rice pleads his case after being shown a second yellow card. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768526_1_20240831222017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton and Hove Albion ended Arsenal's winning start to the new Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at The Emirates on Saturday, with the home side holding on with 10 men after Declan Rice's second-half sending off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Arsenal dominated the first half and deservedly lead at half time after Kai Havertz finished brilliantly in the 38th minute, having been played in expertly by Bukayo Saka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes into the second half, however, Arsenal's task was made all the harder when Rice was sent off after picking up a second yellow card. Brazilian striker Joao Pedro fired Brighton level 12 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides missed golden chances to win the contest late on, but they each had to settle for a point that keeps Arsenal and Brighton unbeaten from their three games so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After narrowly missing out on their first Premier League title since 2004 last season, Arsenal started the new term in perfect fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With champions Manchester City also coming into this weekend's fixtures with two wins from two at the start of the new season, Arsenal know any slip-up, even this early in the campaign, could be costly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They appeared set to be course for a ninth successive league victory after a dominant first-half display. Skipper Martin Odegaard should have scored earlier in the opening period before Havertz lofted home his second of the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rice's second yellow for trying to stop Brighton taking a quick free kick, a decision that was met with consternation around the stands, turned the tide in the visitors' favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Boxing Day 2019 – Mikel Arteta's first game in charge of Arsenal – the Gunners have been shown 16 red cards in the Premier League, at least three more than any other side. But it was Rice's first red in his 245th Premier League appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following his last-gasp winner against Manchester United last weekend, Pedro reacted first after Yankuba Minteh's shot had been saved to pull Brighton level, and the game opened up thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saka could have snatched the win late on, while Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya had to be at his best on several occasions to keep Brighton from earning all three points, but both seemed content with a draw after an exhilarating tussle. (Reuters)

      But it was the end for Wilson Ngai's Paris campaign, who went out in the round of 32, losing to Jere Forsberg of Finland, 142-137, in the men's archery individual compound.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The 52-year-old veteran said the weather conditions might have played a part in his match's outcome.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "It was obvious that I was less nervous this elimination round... I felt that my performance was not bad," he said.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "I still have a passion for archery and will strive to compete at the next [Los Angeles] Paralympic Games."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen kept up the momentum from her victory in Paris with a cathartic win over Germany's Jule Niemeier at the US Open on Friday, while another Chinese woman, Wang Yafan, put out three-time Flushing Meadow finalist Victoria Azarenka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng breezed to a 6-2, 6-1 third round win over Jule Niemeier of Germany in 1 hour and 21 minutes,  exacting a bit of revenge on Niemeier, who eliminated her in this tournament in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I remember that match so clear," Zheng said. "I lost that match at midnight – it was a tough match and really painful. I remember I sat one hour in (the US Open site) at, I don't know, 3 o'clock, there crying by myself alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So today when I play against her, since the beginning I'm really focused, because I don't want that feeling to happen again to me. I'm glad I'm the winner today so I don't have to cry!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng next takes on Donna Vekic of Croatia on Sunday in a repeat of the Paris Games final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Wang recorded a 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 win over twentieth-seeded Azarenka to set up a fourth round tie against Paula Badosa, the 26th seed from Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Coco Gauff continued in her pursuit of recording back-to-back US Open titles by rallying to a 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Elina Svitolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Gauff overcame a mistake-filled first set by saving five of seven break points against the 27th-seeded Svitolina of Ukraine. The highlight of the match came in the third set when Gauff outlasted Svitolina during a fierce 37-stroke exchange that ended when the latter's backhand sailed wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She's a fighter," the 20-year-old Gauff said of Svitolina, a three-time major semifinalist. "I knew I had to play my best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff hopes to give the fans a thrill on Sunday when she vies for a spot in the quarterfinals against 13th-seeded Emma Navarro, who posted a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over 19th-seeded Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine. (Reuters/RTHK)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China teenager Jasmine Ng placed sixth in her women's 200 metres medley SM6 final at the Paris Paralympics on Friday, with British world record holder Maisie Summers-Newton taking gold far ahead of the field.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu Daomin took bronze for the national team while Ellie Marks of the United States won the silver medal, albeit more than five seconds behind Summers-Newton, who went close to her own world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who is taking on three events at the Games at the age of just 14, finished in 3mins, 11.95 seconds. She'd qualified fifith fastest for the final. She's next in action late on Sunday in the 100m breaststroke SB6 final and has the 100m backstroke event to come later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SM6 category denotes medley swimming races for athletes with a number of different types of disability including short stature, major limb impairment or loss in two limbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, boccia athlete Annie Cheung Yuen made it a clean sweep in group play, beating Phonsila Nuanchan of Thailand 5-2. After topping Pool C in the women's BC4 event, she takes on Brazilian Polyana Teixeira in the quarter finals on Sunday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Archer Wilson Ngai, however, went out in the round of 32, losing to Jere Forsberg of Finland, 142-137.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the national team, Hong Yang added a third swimming medal of the Games for China as he won the 200m individual medley SM6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Zhou Xia won China's first gold medal of the athletics events when she sprinted to the women's T35 100m title, for people with impaired coordination, in a time of 13.58sec. (additional reporting by AFP)

    Alcaraz knocked out of US Open, Sinner advances

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alcaraz on court following his second-round defeat to Zandschulp. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768318_1_20240830131810.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Carlos Alcaraz was knocked out of the US Open on Friday, as the final Grand Slam of the year lost one of its biggest crowd-pullers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, the world number three and 2022 champion in New York, was stunned by Dutch world number 74 Botic van de Zandschulp 6-1, 7-5, 6-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz had made at least the quarter-finals in his three previous appearances in New York. Thursday's defeat was his earliest at a Grand Slam since a second round exit at Wimbledon in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat ended his dream of becoming only the third man in the modern era to win the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open in the same season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tennis schedule is so tight. I've been playing a lot of matches lately with Roland Garros, with Wimbledon, Olympic Games," said Alcaraz who lost a draining Olympics final to Novak Djokovic in Paris just over three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I took a little break after the Olympic Games," he added. "Probably it wasn't enough. I came here with not as much energy as I thought that I was going to come. But I don't want to put that as excuse."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, orld number one Jannik Sinner, vying to add the US Open title to the Australian Open crown he won in January, breezed into the third round with a 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 victory over American Alex Michelsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's Sinner needed just an hour and 39 minutes to get past the 49th-ranked Michelsen, giving himself a match point with a crisp forehand winner down the line and polishing it off with a crosscourt forehand volley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a real improvement, for sure," said the 23-year-old, who had to rally from a set and a break down in an unconvincing first-round win over Mackenzie McDonald.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm looking to get better now in the next days," said the Italian, who hit the practice court shortly after the match "trying to understand what works here best on these courts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's see what I can do in the next round," added Sinner, who next plays Australian wild card Christopher O'Connell on Saturday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pablo Castrillo escaped from a breakaway and held off his pursuers on the climb to the line for an emotional Vuelta a España stage win on Thursday as Ben O'Connor protected his overall lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Castrillo, a Spaniard who rides for Kern Pharma, attacked at just before the 10-kilometre climb to the finish of stage 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old celebrated his first World Tour victory, and the first by a Spaniard on this year's Vuelta, by crossing the line pointing skywards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dedicated his success to his team's founder and former president Manolo Azcona, who died during the night at the age of 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought about Manolo the whole stage. I had his strength by my side in those last few kilometres," said Castrillo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I suffered a lot but to be able to win a stage in the Vuelta is just crazy," he added. "I don't have any words. I've gone to the end of my strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Castrillo finished eight seconds ahead of Max Poole after the other members of the elite escape group stopped chasing to avoid helping each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poole, a 21-year-old Briton, had been part of the breakaway the previous day when he finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor, an Australian who rides for AG2R-Decathlon maintained his 3min 16sec lead over the Slovenian from Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pack finished 6min 29sec behind Castrillo on a hilly 125.7 kilometre meander through Galicia from Ourense to the Manzaneda ski resort. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Root scored an England record-equalling 33rd Test hundred as the hosts established a strong position against Sri Lanka on the first day of the second Test at Lord's on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  England, 42-2 when Root came in to bat, reached stumps on 358-7. The star batsman made 143 – his sixth Test century at the 'Home of Cricket'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other England top-order batsman made more than Ben Duckett's 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fast bowler Gus Atkinson was 74 not out at the close – his maiden Test fifty in just his fifth match at this level – after providing Root with excellent support in a seventh-wicket stand of 92 in 19 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we have had a really good day," Root told Sky Sports. "Hopefully we can carry that on now and over 400 would be a really good total."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Root's 206-ball innings saw him equal the England record of 33 Test hundreds held by the retired Alastair Cook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to be quite patient and they bowled well for periods of time," said Root, who made his Test debut in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, all of Sri Lanka's pace trio took two wickets on Thursday, with Lahiru Kumara leading the way with 2-75 in 20 overs after being recalled in place of Vishwa Fernando following England's five-wicket win in last week's first Test at Old Trafford. (AFP)

    Real to face Liverpool in new-look Champions League

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768271_1_20240830082048.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Holders Real Madrid will face Liverpool away and host Borussia Dortmund in a repeat of last season's final in the league stage of the new-look Uefa Champions League, the draw for which took place on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Every team will play eight games against eight different opponents in the new format of Europe's elite club competition, with all 36 clubs now pooled together into one league rather than split into groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-tech draw took place in Monaco, with Cristiano Ronaldo pressing the all-important button to make a computer algorithm determine the fixtures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid, who have signed France superstar Kylian Mbappé since winning a record-extending 15th European Cup, will also notably play AC Milan at home and will go to Atalanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real beat last season's Europa League winners Atalanta in the Uefa Super Cup in Warsaw earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liverpool, who are back in the Champions League after a one-season absence, will also notably meet Milan and take on tournament debutants Girona.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, supporters of the Anfield club will perhaps be most excited about the prospect of hosting German champions Bayer Leverkusen, coached by former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, winners of the competition in 2023, will play at home to Italian champions Inter Milan and go to both Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they were also handed more comfortable opponents including Club Brugge, Sparta Prague and Slovan Bratislava, who have never played in the modern Champions League proper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other standout head-to-heads will include Bayern Munich against both PSG and Barcelona, and Arsenal against Inter and Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of clubs in the Champions League has increased from 32 in the past, with the 36 participants split into four seeded pots of nine for the draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every team faces two teams from each of the four pots, one at home and one away. The first matches will be played on September 17, 18 and 19. (AFP)

 Caroline Groot of the Netherlands rode to victory to earn herself the first gold medal at this year's Paralympic Games on Thursday in the women's para cycling track C4-5 500 metres time trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The seven-time world champion finished the race in 35.566 seconds at the National Velodrome in Paris, over a second faster than silver medallist Marie Patouillet of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Dutch had broken the World and Paralympic record earlier in the day with a time of 35.390 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French cyclist finished in 36.700 seconds, while Canadian Kate O'Brien completed the podium with 36.873 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holder of the C4 category in this event, Kadeena Cox of Great Britain, fell off her bike early on, and could not finish the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The C4-5 class is for cyclists who have impairments affecting their legs, arms, and/or trunk, but still have the capability to use a standard bike.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Novak Djokovic racked up his 90th win at the US Open on Wednesday by defeating Serb compatriot Laslo Djere who retired in the third set of their second round clash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, a four-time champion at the tournament and seeking a record 25th Grand Slam title, was leading 6-4, 6-4, 2-0 when Djere called it quits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world 109, who pushed his countryman to five sets in New York last year, needed a medical time-out to treat an injury just before dropping the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic had himself required a visit from the trainer for what appeared to be a side strain after sealing the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number two Djokovic is now the only man to have won 90 matches at all four Grand Slams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not what we want to see when there's a retirement. Laslo had an injury which took him off the tour for some time and he's been struggling to come back," said Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's such a good player in these conditions and the second set should have been his, he was 4-2 up. I don't know if my winning the second set probably put more burden on him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic will next meet Australia's Alexei Popyrin who he defeated at the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year with both matches going to four sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Popyrin is on a rich vein of form having won the Montreal Masters on the eve of the US Open. (AFP)

 Irish rider Eddie Dunbar produced a sparkling finish to claim the 11th stage of the Vuelta a España on Wednesday while three-time winner Primoz Roglic produced a late surge to chip away at Ben O'Connor's overall lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Team Jayco-AlUla's Dunbar spent much of the 166.5 kilometre route in a breakaway pack, suffering on the sharp hills with everyone else, only bursting clear 600 metres from the line in Padron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known as a climber, it was a surprise move from the 27-year-old Corkman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His rivals failed to pick him up until it was too late, allowing him to take his first ever stage victory in a grand tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a while since I've been in a scenario like this, if I'm honest," Dunbar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just kind of used my experience," he added. "I was suffering a bit on that steep climb, then I realised everyone else was."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Max Poole (Team dsm-firmenich PostNL) followed him across the line two seconds behind to complete the stage podium. (AFP)

 Romanian qualifier Elena-Gabriela Ruse bounced Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova from the second round of the US Open on Wednesday, beating the Czech 6-4, 7-5 to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have no words at this moment," said a beaming Ruse. "It's just a dream for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruse, ranked 122nd in the world, pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament so far with her win over the eighth-ranked Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech, eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Paris Olympics, opted not to play any hard-court tune-ups heading into the US Open, withdrawing from Toronto with a thigh injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She acknowledged before the tournament that obligations in the wake of her Wimbledon victory "took a lot of energy," although adding a second major after her 2021 French Open victory had boosted her confidence and sense of calm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the 26-year-old Ruse – who thanked her team for seeing her through a series of injuries – next faces 26th-seeded Paula Badosa of Spain, a 6-3, 7-5 winner over American Taylor Townsend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be honest right now, I just want to enjoy," said Ruse, who was especially pleased that her father, Adrian, was on hand to watch her play in the United States for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think my father is the lucky charm, for sure," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Paralympics opened in Paris on Wednesday in a colourful ceremony, kicking off 11 days of competition in a city still riding the wave of the successful Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Games open during a ceremony in a balmy Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,400 competitors from 168 delegations paraded into the venue as the sun set, greeting 30,000 spectators across the historic square.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fine weather was in sharp contrast to the heavy rain which fell throughout the Olympics opening ceremony in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a symbol of inclusion, a mix of able-bodied and disabled dancers performed on stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons then expressed his hope for an "inclusion revolution", before Macron officially declared the Games open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eighteen of the 35 Olympic venues - including the Grand Palais and the Stade de France - will be utilised again for the Paralympics, which run until September 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than two million of the 2.5 million tickets on sale have been snapped up, with several events sold out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, which won 96 golds at the last Paralympics in Tokyo, returns with 284 athletes, the most for any delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 126 males and 158 females will compete in 302 events over 19 sports, with 95 being first-time Paralympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China hopes to match their five-medal haul in Tokyo with a 23-strong delegation. Badminton star Daniel Chan and table tennis player Wong Ting-ting were the SAR's flag bearers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has sent a team of 140 athletes to compete in 17 sports, even as the war against Russian forces rages at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 100 athletes from Russia and Belarus will compete under a neutral banner, but they were barred from the ceremonies. (AP, Reuters, Xinhua)

 Former English Premier League ace Ashley Westwood was on Wednesday named as the new head coach of the Hong Kong, China men's football team.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Westwood has signed a two-year contract and will get to know his squad at a tri-nations tournament in Fiji next month, though interim coach Wolfgang Luisser will take charge of the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood most recently led Afghanistan's national team, and he's also coached in England and managed in India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He says his goal is to take Hong Kong to the Asian Cup finals once more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think first and foremost we'll set a good culture and we will make sure the environment that we bring them into is one that they'll want to play, they'll want to come and learn, they'll want to come and improve. I don't have any reservations about the quality in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I've played here before with my Indian sides, I've seen their standard. I think there's good players here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood started his career in the Manchester United academy and played more than 400 senior games in English football for the likes of Crewe, Sheffield Wednesday and Wrexham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most notably, he was part of the Bradford City team that made it to the English Premier League for the first time in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Westwood turned to coaching after his retirement, working for English clubs before switching to Asia, claiming a league title with Bengalaru in India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll take charge of the Hong Kong, China team for the first time in a friendly match against Liechtenstein on October 10 in Vaduz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former coach Jørn Andersen left the SAR in May, later taking up an appointment with a team on the mainland. In January, he led the team to the Asian Cup finals for the first time since 1968.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the Football Association of Hong Kong, China also announced a HK$500,000 initiative to promote football refereeing, in the hope SAR referees will officiate in international competitions in the future.

    Alcaraz, Sinner power into second round at US Open
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The win marks Alcaraz's 15th straight Grand Slam win. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767946_1_20240828103812.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz survived US Open first round wobbles on Tuesday to stay on course for a semi-final showdown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz roared home for a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 victory over 186th-ranked Australian Li Tu to launch his bid to add the US Open to the Roland Garros and Wimbledon titles he claimed this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Spaniard pushed his Grand Slam winning streak to 15 matches as he tries to join Rod Laver and Rafael Nadal as the only men in the modern era to win the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open in the same year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He got off to a hot start, seizing a 4-0 lead on the way to pocketing the first set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tu, who came through qualifying, got to grips with the imposing Arthur Ashe Stadium and Alcaraz's serve to take the second set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He tried to keep the pressure on in the third, but Alcaraz's break for a 4-3 lead opened the floodgates, the Spaniard winning the eight straight games to take the third set and build a 5-0 lead in the fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it surprised me a little bit. In the first set, it was obvious that he started the match nervous," Alcaraz said of Tu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But after the first he started to enjoy, to play really great tennis. I was playing great – probably a few mistakes," added Alcaraz, who had 50 winners and 30 unforced errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third-seeded Spaniard, who won the first of his four Grand Slam titles in New York in 2022, will face Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round, headed toward a possible semi-final showdown with top-ranked Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Sinner, meanwhile, fought back from a set and break down to defeat Mackenzie McDonald at the US Open on Tuesday in his first match since being embroiled in a doping test controversy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Sinner battled to a 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 win over his 140th-ranked opponent on Arthur Ashe Stadium, racing away with 18 of the last 22 games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old Sinner was returning to action just a week after it was revealed he had failed two drug tests in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first match is not easy. McDonald played really well in the beginning so I just tried to stay there mentally and find some rhythm to keep going," Sinner said. "I have room to improve and I'm looking forward to that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory on Tuesday was also a first win for Sinner on the showpiece Arthur Ashe Stadium. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wout van Aert won the 10th stage of the Vuelta a España on Tuesday to seal a hat-trick of victories on his debut in the Spanish Grand Tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Belgian Visma-Lease a Bike rider worked with Quentin Pacher on the way to the finish in Galicia, with the French rider leading out but soon accepting defeat against the sprint king.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Ben O'Connor keeps the overall lead from Primoz Roglic on a relaxed afternoon for the red jersey rider, as the peloton rolled in five-and-a-half minutes down on Van Aert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a tricky 160 kilometre ride from Ponteareas to Baiona, with four categorised climbs, as the race moved north after Monday's rest day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not too often that I can win when my family visits me on the race," said Van Aert, 29, who celebrated with his loved ones after his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was my aim to be in the breakaway, I had a hard time to be honest on the first climb, I almost gave up, I had one more try at the top for 50km – we had to fight for a bit of a gap."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Van Aert is making his debut on the Vuelta after a disappointing Tour de France, when he was unable to secure any victories. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigeria's men's football team on Tuesday appointed experienced German Bruno Labbadia as the country's new coach.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 58-year-old will lead the team against Benin and Rwanda in 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nigeria welcome Benin to Uyo on September 7, before a trip to Rwanda three days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labbadia has handled several top Bundesliga clubs including VfB Stuttgart, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) general secretary Mohammed Sanusi said: "The NFF Executive Committee has approved the recommendation of its technical and development sub-committee to appoint Mr. Bruno Labbadia as the head coach of the Super Eagles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the sixth German to lead the Super Eagles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a player, Labbadia was a prolific scorer, notching over 200 goals in a career that included a spell with Bayern Munich. (AFP)

    Harry Kane receives European Golden Shoe in Munich

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Harry Kane scored more goals last season than any other player in Europe. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767904_1_20240828015826.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich and England striker Harry Kane received the Golden Shoe award as the highest goalscorer in a European football league at a ceremony in the Bavarian capital on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kane scored 36 goals during the previous Bundesliga season, more than any other player in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite being the top Premier League scorer three times, Kane had never won the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a fantastic feeling," Kane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The award is for everyone. Without you, I wouldn't be standing here today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel good and am looking forward to the new season. I feel a new energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud to receive this award."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prize was the latest won by the striker in a long list of personal awards, but Kane is still yet to win a team title in his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane went trophy-less in his debut year in Munich, the first time Bayern finished a season without silverware since 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters: "I want to continue on as I started last season, but it is important to win titles. We want to achieve success as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kane's tally of 36 goals in 32 Bayern appearances is just five shy of the single-season record held by former Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski of 41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England captain was handed the award by Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen, who praised Kane's character since making the move to Munich one season ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Created in the 1967-68 season, the Golden Shoe was formerly awarded to the top scorer in any European league, but in 1997 was changed to use a ranking system which favours players in higher-ranked leagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With six wins, Lionel Messi has received the award more than anyone else. Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland have previously won the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is something special that I am now mentioned in the same breath as these names," Kane said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Owners of the US National Football League (NFL) are set to vote on Tuesday on allowing private equity investment, a move that could offer an influx of cash for new stadiums and other projects.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the vote, the NFL's 32 owners are likely to allow private equity firms to purchase up to a 10 percent team stake, according to a CNBC report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of companies that have been approved plan to commit US$12 billion in capital over time, CNBC added, citing people familiar with the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each fund or consortium can make deals with up to six teams, and the firms which have been green-lit include Ares Management, Sixth Street Partners and Arctos Partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also a consortium including names like Blackstone and the Carlyle Group, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other large sports leagues like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association already allow private equity ownership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the NFL – the most popular and prosperous US league – formed a committee to consider allowing private equity funding, and it has recently met with the companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With rising valuations of NFL teams, fewer potential owners can come up with full funding when teams are on the market. (AFP)

    India's Jay Shah to be cricket world body chairman
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jay Shah says he wants to elevate the love for cricket worldwide. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767897_1_20240827234937.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's cricket chief Jay Shah has been elected unopposed as chairman of the sport's world body, the International Cricket Council, it said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shah will take over the role from December, after current Chair Greg Barclay decided not to seek a third term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and our member nations to further globalise cricket," Shah said, adding he was "humbled" by the appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our goal is to make cricket more inclusive and popular than ever before."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From being the chief of the world's richest cricket board to leading the ICC, the 35-year-old's meteoric rise illustrates India's domination of the sport's global administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a country where the sport and politics go hand in glove, Shah is best known for being the son of home minister Amit Shah, the right-hand man of Hindu-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shah, the powerful Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India since 2019, becomes the youngest ICC chairman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top cricketers in India enjoy superstardom with millions of die-hard fans, most lucrative playing contracts, and endorsement deals not seen anywhere else in global cricket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By some counts, Indian cricket on average generates more revenue than Bollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 percent of the sport's billion-plus worldwide fans are in the Indian subcontinent, according to a 2018 ICC study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICC is the global governing body for cricket, with more than 100 members, and is responsible for staging global events such as the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shah said he wanted to "embrace fresh thinking and innovation to elevate the love for cricket worldwide." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Olympics champion Zheng Qinwen rallied from a set down to beat Amanda Anisimova 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Monday and reach the second round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  American Anisimova had Zheng on the run early, but the world number seven from China was able to turn things around for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 triumph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was especially pleased to build on the momentum of her Paris Games triumph, which made her the first Olympic singles champion from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the typical match I will lose, especially after huge success," Zheng said. "Usually after huge success I will get a little bit too high, until the reality slap me down again and I come back to the ground and trying to be humble and work hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng, 21, said before the US Open that she wanted to avoid that kind of let-down, but Anisimova didn't make it easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was really difficult, the match today," she said. "She's hitting the ball very strong and the only things I feel like I can do today during the match is just to stay with her and find my moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff launched her US Open title defence with a 6-2, 6-0 victory over Varvara Gracheva on Monday, firing 10 aces and saving eight break points to advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old American worked through some tight moments early on to polish off the victory in 66 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium, where she captured her first Grand Slam title last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was breezing through the second set when France's Gracheva, ranked 66th in the world, mustered a pair of break points in the final game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff saved both with aces as she booked a second-round meeting with Tatjana Maria of Germany, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over Argentina's Solana Sierra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I served well," Gauff said. "Can't ask for a better start into this tournament, so hoping to continue to get better as the week, two weeks go by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff's build-up to the final Grand Slam of the season has been less than ideal. She fell in the third round at Toronto and lost her first match as the defending champion in Cincinnati.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she said taking the long view was helping her stay steady as she tries for the first time to defend a major title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last couple of weeks were tough, and I was, like, 'I have to do this and do that.' But I don't have to prove anything to anyone except myself," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that perspective, "and just having the belief that I can but not the expectation that I should" had tamped down the pressure. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Sox catcher Danny Jansen became the first player in major league history to appear in the same game for both teams when he took the field for Boston on Monday in the resumption of a rain-delayed game he started for Toronto in June.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jansen was in the Blue Jays' lineup at catcher and batting in the second inning on June 26 when the game was suspended. He was traded to the Red Sox last month, and on Monday he took his position behind the plate as pinch-hitter Daulton Varsho struck out to complete the at-bat that Jansen started.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An authenticator was on hand to tag all of Jansen’s equipment, and the Baseball Hall of Fame said it requested the scorecard from official scorer Bob Ellis. Ellis was also working the game when it started in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This scorecard will be a great tool to document and illustrate this history, showing Danny Jansen’s name on both teams,” Hall spokesman John Shestakofsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the ballpark opened to fans, the scoreboards were showing Jansen at bat for the Blue Jays – complete with a picture of him in his Toronto cap. Before the first pitch, the umpires held an extended conversation at home with the coaches who brought out some of the weirdest lineup cards in baseball history. (AP)

    Ex-England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson dead at 76

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eriksson also managed Mexico, Ivory Coast and the Philippines, but never his native Sweden's national squad. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767727_1_20240826201351.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swedish football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who coached England from 2001 to 2006, died on Monday at the age of 76 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, his agent said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "He passed away peacefully this morning with his family around him at his home," Eriksson's agent Bo Gustavsson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swede, who managed a number of high-profile teams and took England to World Cup quarter-finals in 2002 and 2006, announced in February 2023 that he was stepping back from public life due to "health issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, he told public broadcaster Sveriges Radio that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer and that his doctor's assessment was that he had "at best maybe a year (to live), at worst a little less."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have known about this but it happened very quickly. We were not prepared for it to happen today," said Gustavsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born February 5, 1948 in Sunne in western Sweden, Eriksson, who goes by "Svennis" to Swedes, found success as a football manager after retiring from a modest career as a defender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 1977, he became manager of Swedish club Degerfors IF. After leading the small club to success in lower divisions, he attracted the attention of bigger clubs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to manage Sweden's IFK Goteborg before finding success internationally, managing Benfica in Portugal, as well as several Italian teams including Roma and Lazio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most high-profile position was as the first foreigner to manage England's national squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his spell, he took England to the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002, where they were knocked out by Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also made the last eight four years later where Portugal came out on top in a penalty shoot-out in a game where Wayne Rooney was sent off after a clash with his then Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksson led England to the last eight of the 2004 Euros where Portugal again knocked them out in another penalty shoot-out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left the England job in 2006 after five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His time in the hotseat had seen a memorable 5-1 win over Germany in a World Cup qualifier but also controversy over his personal life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksson then went on to manage Mexico, Ivory Coast and the Philippines, but never his native Sweden's national squad. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lydia Ko said she had enjoyed a "Cinderella" story after ending an eight-year wait for a major title by winning the Women's British Open at St. Andrews on Sunday, just a fortnight after her Olympic gold medal triumph in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New Zealander finished in champion style with a superb birdie on the 18th hole of a windswept Old Course to complete a round of three-under-par 69 and claim her third major title with a tournament total of seven under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is surreal," Ko said. "Winning the gold medal in Paris a few weeks ago was almost too good to be true. Heading into the weekend I thought 'how is it possible for me to win the Open?'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko entered the final day three shots back of third-round leader Jiyai Shin, a two-time Women's Open champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shin was one of four women tied for second, with China's Ruoning Yin, Nelly Korda and Lilia Vu – each of them former major winners who have been ranked No. 1 in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is almost too good to be true," she added. "Out of all the major championships, this was the one I had the least amount of confidence in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory gave Ko, 27, her first major since she won the 2016 Chevron Championship. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Adam Yates secured a sensational stage nine victory in the Vuelta a Espana on Sunday to revive his general classification hopes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British UAE Team Emirates rider went solo 58 kilometres from the finish in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He crossed the line one minute 39 seconds ahead of Richard Carapaz, who also put himself back in contention with a superb ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never suffered like this before, it's so hot out there," said Yates. "From the last climb I was cramping and I didn't know if I could go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had a lot of bad luck in Grand Tours over the years and I really didn't know if I could make it," he added. "But I'm just so happy I could finally win another Grand Tour stage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Ben O'Connor retained the red jersey and increased his lead on second placed Primoz Roglic to three minutes 53 seconds by claiming four bonus seconds as he finished third on the 178.5km run from Motril to Granada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every second counts, and I didn't lose time today – to some guys, yes – but in the end I showed my real capacity and what I can do, so I'm proud." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish champions Real Madrid earned a 3-0 win over Real Valladolid in La Liga on Sunday as Kylian Mbappé made his Santiago Bernabeu bow without finding the net.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atletico Madrid comfortably beat last season's surprise package Girona by the same scoreline later on in the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's French striker Mbappé played at home for the first time in a Los Blancos shirt but was largely frustrated by Valladolid's defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde opened the scoring after 50 minutes and substitutes Brahim Diaz and debutant Endrick struck late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without the injured Jude Bellingham Madrid created little in the first half but did enough after the break to earn their first win of the season, following an opening draw at Real Mallorca.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still lacking fluency in attack, Carlo Ancelotti's side stayed two points behind rivals Barcelona, who beat Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé scored on his debut in a UEFA Super Cup triumph but in La Liga, has failed to score in his opening two matches. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris celebrates on the podium after winning the Dutch Grand Prix with third placed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767598_1_20240826011450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris stormed to victory at the Dutch Grand Prix on Sunday, a superb drive consigning home favourite Max Verstappen to his first-ever loss in front of his "Orange Army" fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British driver claimed his second career chequered flag after winning in Miami in May, closing Verstappen's lead over him in the world championship to 70 points, with the Dutchman coming second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite raucous encouragement from a packed Zandvoort circuit, Verstappen could not extract enough from his Red Bull to compete with a recently upgraded McLaren that is beginning to look like the car to beat in Formula One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels amazing... The pace was very strong and the car was unbelievable today," said Norris, who also secured a point for the fastest lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The start was critical. Questions have been asked of the starting ability of Norris, who has three times this season failed to convert pole position into a first lap lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And again Norris was sluggish off the line, allowing Verstappen to power around the outside to huge cheers from the crowd, who saw their man take a 0.9-second advantage into the second lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buoyed by the fast start, Verstappen clocked the quickest lap in lap two, putting clear daylight between him and the McLaren of Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the McLaren had been the fastest car in the paddock all race weekend and Norris started slowly but surely eating into Verstappen's lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 17 out of 72, Norris was only a few tenths of a second behind Verstappen, the Dutchman complaining on his team radio of a lack of grip from his tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris passed him a lap later on the outside at turn one, Verstappen powerless to prevent the overtake and quickly falling further behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't go faster. The car is not responding to my inputs," a desperate Verstappen told his engineers as Norris stretched his advantage to more than four seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On lap 25, Verstappen decided enough was enough and he needed a new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris pitted the lap after, his team taking 0.6 seconds longer than the Red Bull for the pit stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, Norris emerged from the two stops five seconds ahead of his rival and promptly produced the fastest lap of the race on his new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 40, Norris had extended the advantage to more than 10 seconds over the three-time champion and just had to stay out of trouble to take the chequered flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His eventual margin of victory was 22.896 seconds, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc holding off Norris's McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri to claim the third podium spot after a thrilling battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's struggling second driver Sergio Perez finished in sixth position, meaning the gap in the constructors' championship also narrowed from 42 points to 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wouldn't say a perfect race because of lap one again, but afterwards it was beautiful," said Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expected Max to start pushing and get a bit of a gap. And he never did. So from that point, I knew we were in with a good fight," added Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But he seemed to just keep dropping off. And my pace was getting better. So it's a nice feeling inside the car. And especially when I got past, you know, I could just get comfortable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The F1 circus now moves on to the famous Monza track in Italy next weekend, round 16 of 24 with everyone snapping at Verstappen's heels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has not won a Grand Prix since Barcelona in June, his longest barren spell since 2020 and while it is premature to talk of panic stations at Red Bull, the Dutch weekend will have given some cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You always try to do better and we had a good start, we tried everything we could today, but throughout the race it was quite clear that we are not quick enough, so I tried to be second today," said Verstappen. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 at Molineux on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chelsea's first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca's side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer, but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves fell part after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side's sixth goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much has been made of Chelsea's huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea's league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today means a lot. I was really just trying to be clever and wait for the right moment," Madueke said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unbelievable. (Palmer) is cold and I am fire so it mixes well. He has the ability to always play a pass at the right time. I like to get the ball in space, beat people and make things happen, so luckily today it worked."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair combined to restore Chelsea's lead in the 49th minute with the 22-year-old Madueke getting lucky as his shot deflected off of Rayan Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That goal sapped the fight out of Wolves and it was Palmer again who sent the over-lapping Madueke clear to slam a shot through the legs of Wolves keeper Jose Sa's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke made it 5-2 with an almost identical goal as Wolves conceded possession and Cole sent him clear to complete his hat-trick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves will wonder what happened after they played some enterprising football in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were caught cold when Jackson headed Chelsea in front after two minutes but deservedly levelled in the 27th minute when Cunha fired home after being set up by Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves pressed for a second but it was Chelsea who went back in front on the stroke of halftime with Palmer producing a delightful lobbed finish from 30 metres with his left foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea were caught out again in first-half stoppage time, however, as Norwegian Strand Larsen opened his Wolves account, stretching out his foot to convert from close range after a free kick was headed across the penalty area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Newcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara's effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought the game was lost because I initially hadn't seen anything wrong with the goal," said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe who was given a warm reception on his return to his old club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have had it for us and against us and we are very grateful for that moment because we have battled hard. But I understand that it is a contentious decision." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong martial arts actor Jackie Chan was named on Sunday as one of the torchbearers in the lead-up to the opening ceremony of the Paralympics in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 70-year-old, known for his stunts and acrobatic fight scenes, will carry the flame on Wednesday afternoon in the French capital just hours before the opening ceremony, the organising committee announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French actress Elsa Zylberstein, and dancer/choreographer Benjamin Millepied will also take part in the torch relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As with the Olympic opening ceremony, Wednesday's event will take place beyond the confines of the Stade de France, with a parade down the Champs-Elysees to the Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame, which was was lit on Saturday in Stoke Mandeville in the UK, the historic birthplace of the Paralympic Games, arrived in France via the Channel Tunnel on Sunday, carried by wheelchair fencing medalist Emmanuelle Assmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about inscribing sport in the hearts of people with disabilities," said French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera who was on hand to welcome the flame, alongside Tony Estanguet, head of the organising committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame was due to continue its journey where it would be "multiplied" into 12 Paralympic flames, which will be carried by 1,000 torchbearers in around 50 towns, in 12 simultaneous relays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These 12 relays will converge on Paris, where the flame will arrive on Wednesday for the opening ceremony. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United crashed to a last-gasp 2-1 defeat against Brighton and an Erling Haaland's hat-trick fired Premier League champions Manchester City to a 4-1 win against Ipswich on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's side were left shell-shocked by Joao Pedro's winner five minutes into stoppage-time at the Amex Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United fell behind to a 32nd minute goal from Danny Welbeck, who poked in Kaoru Mitoma's cross for his sixth goal in 16 appearances against his former club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo equalised for United after an hour, cutting inside for a shot that deflected in off Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Zirkzee prevented Alejandro Garnacho from putting the visitors ahead in the closing stages when the United forward touched home his team-mate's finish on the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, a close-season signing from Bologna, was in an offside position and VAR ruled out the goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left completely unmarked at the far post, Brazilian striker Pedro rubbed salt into United's wounds as he headed home from Simon Adingra's cross to ensure Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler maintained his 100 per cent start following last weekend's win at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old German is the youngest permanent manager in Premier League history after arriving from St Pauli to replace Roberto De Zerbi in the close-season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team deserved to win. These moments make memories and we have to enjoy it," Hurzeler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag added: "Both goals are very soft. As a team, we should have done better. We have to be more clinical in both boxes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City scored three times in four minutes to survive an early scare against promoted Ipswich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sammie Szmodics, signed from Blackburn in the close-season, gave Ipswich a shock lead in the seventh minute, running on to Omari Hutchinson's pass and squeezing his shot through Ederson's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City levelled when Leif Davis's 12th minute foul on Savinho conceded a penalty that Haaland dispatched with ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich keeper Arijanet Muric spent four years with City before leaving in 2022 and he returned with a gift for his old club, dwelling in possession in the 14th minute as Kevin De Bruyne stole the ball and slotted home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City made it three when the unstoppable Haaland flicked De Bruyne's deft pass past Muric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German midfielder Ilkay Gundogan came off the bench for City in the second half after rejoining his former club from Barcelona on a one-year contract on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland completed his treble in the 88th minute with a typically predatory finish for his fourth goal already this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma got back in favour with boss Ange Postecoglou as his superb strike inspired a 4-0 rout of Everton in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou picker Bissouma following a one-game suspension after posting a social media video that showed him inhaling nitrous oxide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know what it's like when you punish your child and they do everything right for the next two days?" Postecoglou had said of Bissouma's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mali international made the most of his reprieve in the 14th minute, lashing home from the edge of the area for his first league goal for Tottenham in his 52nd appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Son Heung-min doubled Tottenham's lead in the 25th minute, forcing Jordan Pickford into an embarrassing mistake as the Everton keeper was robbed by the South Korean for a simple finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristian Romero headed Tottenham's third in the 71st minute. Son bagged his second with a clinical finish six minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui earned the first win of his reign as second half goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen sealed a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Iwobi's 70th minute goal clinched Fulham's 2-1 win against Leicester at Craven Cottage after Emile Smith Rowe's first half opener for the hosts was cancelled out by Wout Faes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nottingham Forest won 1-0 at Southampton thanks to Morgan Gibbs-White's 70th minute strike.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 65 national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics – most of them gold medallists – will visit Hong Kong next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They include diving duo Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, winners of the women's synchronised 10m platform, as well as table tennis champions such as Ma Long, Fan Zhendong and Sun Yingsha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also among the list are swimmer Zhang Yufei, who won six medals in Paris, breaking bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, as "671", and street skateboarder Cui Chenxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the nation's first Olympic tennis champion, Zheng Qinwen, will not be on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes from 16 sports will be joined by eight coaches, and led by director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan. They will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong from August 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will attend a gala show before showcasing their skills at two demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park swimming pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for all three events were sold out in about half an hour on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will also attend a reception and a banquet hosted by the SAR government, and meet local athletes at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, before heading to neighbouring Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team bagged 40 gold medals at the Paris Games, on top of 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.
