<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany survived a scare to finish top of Group A at Euro 2024 as Niclas Fuellkrug's stoppage-time goal rescued a 1-1 draw against Switzerland, while Scotland were eliminated after a last-gasp 1-0 defeat against Hungary whose striker Barnabas Varga suffered a sickening injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dan Ndoye's first-half goal in Frankfurt had put Switzerland on course to climb above hosts Germany into top spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fuellkrug's late header ensured Julian Nagelsmann's side advanced to the last 16 in pole position with seven points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Germans, who last won the Euros in 1996, will take on the Group C runners-up – currently slated to be Denmark – in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark, two points behind leaders England, play Serbia in their last group game on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany are also on track for a potential quarter-final clash with Spain, who have been among the best teams at the tournament so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland, who reached the quarter-finals at the last Euros in 2021, have now made the knockout stage in six successive major tournaments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Group A runners-up with five points, the Swiss will face the second-placed team in Group B in the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Germany were already through to the last 16 after beating Scotland and Hungary, Nagelsmann opted against resting his stars as he named an unchanged team for a third successive game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland took a shock lead in the 28th minute as Ndoye met Remo Freuler's cross with a close-range volley that flashed past Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndoye's first international goal was made in Bologna as both he and Freuler played for the Serie A club last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adding to Germany's problems, Jonathan Tah was booked, earning the centre-back a ban for the first knockout game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany dominated possession but Ilkay Gundogan scuffed wide with the goal at his mercy after Yann Sommer parried Jamal Musiala's stinging strike into the midfielder's path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their pressure was finally rewarded in stoppage-time when Fuellkrug rose highest to power his header into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Stuttgart, Scotland were unable to secure the victory that would likely have taken them into the knockout stage of a major tournament for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 11 previous appearances at major competitions – eight World Cups and three European Championships – Scotland had bowed out at the group stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once again, they will fly home early after taking just one point from their three matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Clarke's team, who lost to Germany and drew with Switzerland in their first two games, were sunk by a goal 10 minutes into stoppage-time from Kevin Csoboth, whose clinical finish capped a rapid raid from the Hungarians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary may not secure a last 16 berth despite their victory as they have only three points from their three games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four third-placed teams with the best records from the six groups will move into the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary's win came at a cost as Varga was stretchered off after a sickening collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga collapsed to the pitch and was struggling to move after chasing a long cross into the area as Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn came to collect the ball.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a long delay, medics took the 29-year-old from the pitch while a sheet was draped around the stretcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai appeared to be in tears as he consoled his stricken teammate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga was immediately taken to hospital after the incident where he was said to be conscious and talking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The condition of Barnabas Varga is stable," the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hungarian national team player is currently in one of the hospitals in Stuttgart. We will inform you immediately if there is any news on his status."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Group B on Monday, Italy take on Croatia, while Spain, already qualified in first place, face Albania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy are second in the group with three points, while Croatia and Albania both have one point. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen won the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday from McLaren's pole-sitter Lando Norris to extend his lead in the world championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lewis Hamilton completed the podium at the Barcelona-Catalunya circuit for the Mercedes seven-time former champion's first podium of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The racing may be closer than the past two seasons but Verstappen always seems to pull it out of the bag when it matters most.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was his 61st career win, seventh of the season, and fourth at the track he first shot onto the F1 scene as a teenager in 2016. (AFP)

    Afghanistan stun Australia in T20 Cricket World Cup

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Afghanistan's Rahmanullah Gurbaz (right) celebrates his team's victory. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758674_1_20240623152405.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran shared an opening stand of 118 before Gulbadin Naib took over to drive Afghanistan to a 21-run win over Australia in St Vincent on Saturday and keep alive their hopes of reaching the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A win for Australia would have sent the 2021 champions and India into the last four, but even a second hat-trick in as many matches from Pat Cummins was not enough to keep their unbeaten record at the tournament intact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half centuries from Gurbaz and Zadran helped the Afghans rack up 148-6 in their 20 overs, before their bowlers dismissed the Australians for 127 on a tricky Kingstown track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naib claimed 4-20 and Naveen-ul-Haq bagged 3-20, but it was the third century partnership of the tournament from Gurbaz and Zadran that laid the foundation for a win that also kept Bangladesh alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've waited for a long time (for this)," said man-of-the-match Naib.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a big moment for our nation and our people. I have no words, but thanks to the fans who supported us in our career and cricket journey ... thank God we finally beat Australia. It's a great achievement for Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have achieved many things in the last 10 years, but this is big."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India top Group 1 on four points, ahead of Australia and Afghanistan on two, with Bangladesh alone in last place, with none.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India and Australia face off in St Lucia on Monday, while the Afghans stay in St Vincent to play Bangladesh in the final Super Eight match later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia skipper Mitchell Marsh won the toss and sprang a couple of surprises by sending the Afghans in to bat and naming a team with left-arm spinner Ashton Agar in the bowling line-up in place of Mitchell Starc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the early overs it looked like the Australian bowlers would suffocate the Afghans, but the lack of a breakthrough wicket allowed Gurbaz and Zadran to settle in and accelerate through the middle overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crisp batting and hard running from the Afghans put the pressure back on the Australians, who made uncharacteristic fielding errors under the Arnos Vale Ground lights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair reached their half-centuries before Marcus Stoinis finally separated them in the 16th over, when Gurbaz mistimed a shot to David Warner at deep square leg to depart for 60.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spinner Adam Zampa removed Azmatullah Omarzai (2) and Zadran (51) in the following over and paceman Cummins sent back skipper Rashid Khan cheaply with the final ball of the 18th over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Karim Janat and Naib followed with the first two deliveries of the 20th over as Cummins became the first bowler to take two hat-tricks at a T20 World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He would have taken four wickets in a row had Warner held onto a reasonably straightforward catch running in from deep point to dismiss Nangeyalia Kharote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They got 20 runs too many," admitted Marsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be honest, they played a really good game of cricket. We were outplayed tonight ... It was an off-night in the field and we own that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afghanistan made the best possible start with ball in hand with Naveen bowling Travis Head for a duck in the opening over and having Marsh caught in the deep for 12 in the third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warner followed for three off Mohammad Nabi's first delivery to leave the Australians struggling on 32-3 in the final over of the power play, before the Afghans heaped more pressure on their opponents by removing Stoinis and Tim David.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The explosive Glenn Maxwell gave Australia some hope with a battling 59 off 41 balls, but his dismissal by Naib, thanks to an acrobatic catch by Noor Ahmad, all but sealed the fate of the former champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I learnt from the batting innings on how to bowl," added Naib, who also took a low diving catch to dismiss Ashton Agar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to Rashid for trusting me, it's a team effort, Rahmanullah, Zadran and also Naveen for the momentum." (Reuters)

    Portugal ease past Turkey to win last 16 spot

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Portugal cruised to a 3-0 win against Turkey on Saturday and booked their spot in the Euro 2024 last 16 as Group F winners thanks to a Bernardo Silva strike, an own-goal by Samet Akaydin and a Bruno Fernandes tap-in.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Silva scored his first goal in a major international tournament in the 21st minute when a cross from Nuno Mendes deflected off a Turkish defender to find the Manchester City forward ghosting alone in the area, who then smashed it past the goalkeeper to put the Portuguese ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven minutes later, Turkish defender Akaydin made a comical mistake as he tried to play the ball back to his goalkeeper who was out of position and there was nothing he could to stop it from rolling into the net despite their desperate attempts to keep it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Portugal kept dominating and extended their lead after substitute Ruben Neves set Cristiano Ronaldo free with a long ball to beat the offside line and, after drawing in the goalkeeper, squared the ball for Fernandes who only had to tap it into an empty goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win lifts Portugal to a guaranteed first place in Group F on six points, three ahead Turkey in second and five ahead of Georgia and Czech Republic with one game to go. (Reuters)

    Belgium defeat Romania in action-packed game

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Belgium's Kevin De Bruyne celebrates scoring his team's second goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758638_1_20240623073158.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A goal by Youri Tielemans after 73 seconds and a late one for Kevin De Bruyne gave Belgium a 2-0 win over Romania in an incredible, action-packed game on Saturday that set up a final round showdown with all four teams in Group E on three points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was a Euro 2024 Saturday night special played in an astonishing atmosphere in Cologne, with the only mystery being how there were only two goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It meant that, for the first time in European Championship history, all four teams in a group are on equal points after two rounds, following Ukraine's 2-1 win over Slovakia on Friday. All outcomes are now available on the final night on Wednesday when Belgium play Ukraine and Slovakia play Romania, where four points could be enough to top the group but could also see a team eliminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania and Belgium have the advantage with a plus-one goal difference. Slovakia are on zero and Ukraine on -2 - with those goal differences the deciding factor should both games end level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were very relieved we won the game, it was very important to get three points," said Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco. "Romania gave us a bit more space that Slovakia but with the quality and quantity of our chances it would have been good if we could have scored more early on - four or five goals tonight would have been possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium, still somehow ranked third in the world by FIFA, were unrecognisable from the sluggish side shocked by Slovakia in their opening game, pouring forward and full of energy from the first whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It paid dividends immediately as Romelu Lukaku held up the ball with his back to goal before rolling it into the path of Tielemans, who drilled home a crisp, low shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four minutes later Romania went close with a header by Radu Dragusin that Koen Casteels saved well, but it was a brief respite as Belgium ran the first-half show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dodi Lukebakio’s fierce shot was well saved by Florin Nita after a trademark carving run by man of the match De Bruyne, while Lukebakio and Amadou Onana both blazed over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It seemed only a matter of time before they scored again, but Romania weathered the storm and, knowing how they struck so devastatingly on the counter to beat Ukraine, did not panic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their fans certainly stayed behind them, helping create an amazing atmosphere as noise rained down from all four stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waves of Belgian attacks continued though, as Jeremy Doku fizzed a cross inches from Lukaku’s head, De Bruyne curled just past a post then had another shot smothered by Nita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukaku thought he had got the second after an hour, slotting home confidently from a De Bruyne through ball, only for VAR to rule it out for offside – five days after he had two goals chalked off against Slovakia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incredible end-to-end action continued with Dennis Man clean through for Romania only to shoot wastefully straight at Casteels and then, incredibly, it was the Belgian keeper who set up the second 10 minutes from time with a Sunday league, route one goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He launched a goal kick that evaded everyone and the ever-switched on De Bruyne seized on it to tuck the ball home for what could prove a priceless goal should the calculators be needed to split the teams next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania, of course, are also still in the hunt to reach the knockout stage for only the second time, having failed to even qualify for the last six World Cups following their golden era of the 1990s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a great start to the tournament, now let's see how we deal with difficulty. We need solidarity and unity because we are still first in the group," their coach Edward Iordanescu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a most complicated group - a third goal would have been really bad for us." (AFP)

    Georgia in historic draw against Czechs at Euro 2024

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili hailed his team's "historic" first ever point after a thrilling 1-1 draw against the Czech Republic at Euro 2024 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Georges Mikautadze struck from the penalty spot for the Euros debutants in the first half in Hamburg but Patrik Schick levelled for the Czechs after the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valencia stopper Mamardashvili made 11 saves in a brilliant display and was named player of the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After an opening defeat by Turkey, the draw means Georgia will likely have to beat one of the tournament favourites Portugal in their third match to progress from Group F.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am quite happy and satisfied just for being here... our first point is a historic moment," Mamardashvili told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia might even have won the game at the death against the run of play, but after being sent in on goal, substitute Saba Lobjanidze hammered over the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Atalanta United winger's team-mates and Georgia coach Willy Sagnol went to him at the end to try and raise his spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the three-and-a-half years I've been coaching Georgia, we've done a lot of very positive things on the pitch, but it's also a massive and very important human experience for me.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sagnol said his squad had mixed feelings at full-time after claiming their first point but seeing two more slip between their fingers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know if the point is deserved, but for everything we've done together, I think it's deserved." he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech coach Ivan Hasek said it was a scary moment for his side, who had dominated the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last seconds it was three-on-one, we were really scared, and we survived it and we have to go on," said the coach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't want to go home yet, we will fight until the very end against Turkey so we can get into the knock-out rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech goalscorer Schick limped off with an apparent calf problem in the second half and Hasek said further tests were needed, although he was not positive the Bayer Leverkusen striker would be ready for the final group match on Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Second-seeded German Alexander Zverev fell in straight sets to Pole Hubert Hurkacz in the semi-final of the Halle grass-court tournament on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hurkacz won through 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in one-hour, 33-minute and will next play either world number one Jannik Sinner or China's Zhang Zhizhen for the title in the pre-Wimbledon warm-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fifth-seeded Pole, winner in Halle two years ago, will bid to win his second title of the season after on clay at Estoril in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really confident on my serve," said Hurkacz who fired 17 aces including 13 in the first set and saved all four break points he faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It needed to be really good," said Hurkacz after his first win over Zverev in four meetings, most recently a three-set defeat in the United Cup final, a mixed team event before the Australian Open in Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That match that was a little bit sitting in the back in my mind," said Hurkacz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was like, okay, not today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is such a good competitor and is playing good tennis, reaching the final at the French (Open) and playing at a really high level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Hurkacz will aim to clinch his ninth ATP Tour title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really love grass," said Hurkacz, the 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist. "The surface suits my game and the atmosphere here, having the full crowd is incredible." (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758551_1_20240622081006.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Austria claimed a convincing 3-1 win over Poland in Berlin on Friday to take a step towards the Euro 2024 knock-out rounds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Robert Lewandowski returned from a thigh injury as a substitute for Poland, now on the brink of elimination from Group D after two defeats, but could not help his team make inroads against Ralf Rangnick's sturdy side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland striker Krzysztof Piatek levelled Gernot Trauner's opener, but Christoph Baumgartner and Marko Arnautovic's second-half goals earned Austria three vital points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria dominated the opening stages and Trauner powered home a header at the near post from the enterprising Phillipp Mwene's cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Piatek levelled for Poland after half an hour, staying calm in the box when a rebound fell his way and slotting into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the game level approaching the hour mark, Poland coach Michal Probierz sent on Lewandowski, who took the captain's armband.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Showing little concern about his injury, the forward charged around and quickly picked up a booking for catching Philipp Lienhart with his arm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria regained the lead after 67 minutes when Arnautovic cleverly stepped over a pass received by Baumgartner, who stroked into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Baumgartner celebrated wildly with Rangnick and gave the former interim Manchester United coach credit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He supports me every day and gave me a lot of strength at half-time," explained the midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He talked to me for three or four minutes, so the thanks went to him too."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran captain Arnautovic, 35, sealed the win with a late penalty after Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny felled Marcel Sabitzer. (Reuters)

    Slovakia try to shrug off loss to Ukraine

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758550_1_20240622075732.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia remain underdogs in Euro 2024 and are determined to make a good run in the tournament, coach Francesco Calzona said on Friday, hailing a crop of players who performed well even in defeat against a determined Ukraine side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovakia started the Group E match strongly with a succession of chances leading to Ivan Schranz netting his second goal of the championship in the 17th minute, but a resolute Ukraine fought back to level the score after the break and stunned the Slovakians with another 10 minutes from time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovakia came into the match with 10 wins from the last 14 games, including their shock 1-0 victory over Belgium on Monday, and needed just one more to advance early to the next round of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had the opportunity but we knew that we were coming up against a team that had to win at all costs to stay in the hunt to make it through to the knockout stage," Italian Calzona said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us we are the Cinderella story of the group stage so the fact that we're already here and competing to make it through to the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team try and play football against anyone regardless of the opposition and I'm very proud of that fact," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defeat for Slovakia will be a reminder of their last Euros, when their opening victory was followed by two defeats, including a 5-0 drubbing by Spain, and an early exit from the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calzona said the loss to Ukraine was all about the strength of a team that was desperate to make amends for their 3-0 trouncing by Romania, Slovakia's next opponents. Romania play Belgium on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we led this evening there was still a long way to go. We played very strong opposition, we know that. I am happy with my team's performance, we produced a great display, I'm very proud of my lads," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A few months ago it would have been inconceivable that our team could play against these strong sides." (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French star Kylian Mbappe remained on the bench after suffering a broken nose. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758549_1_20240622075014.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France missed Kylian Mbappe in a wasteful display against the Netherlands but keeping their main man on the bench rather than risk him so soon after a broken nose may prove clever if he returns to help Les Bleus go deep into Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mbappe, who had run riot against the Dutch in the past with six goals in five games, was ready to come on with a mask.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he remained an unused substitute in the tournament's first 0-0 draw - a disappointing spectacle given the two sides' pedigree but a result that leaves both on four points and virtually through to the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the absence of Mbappe, 33-year-old Antoine Griezmann took the captain's armband and also occupied his attacking space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he failed to convert a stream of chances, twice getting the ball caught under his feet when right in front of goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France enjoyed 58% possession, completed 614 passes to the Netherlands' 353, and had double the number of goal attempts at 16. But coach Didier Deschamps may not worry too much about the team's profligacy, given their control of large periods of the game and the likelihood of Mbappe's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether the forward is rested for the last group game against Poland remains to be seen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he is back on the pitch, Mbappe, 25, will have a point to prove: he has never scored at a Euros tournament and in 2021 his penalty was saved in a shootout with Switzerland which saw France exit at the last 16 stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, he has 12 goals at World Cups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Griezmann missed a header, several shots and those couple of bundled close-range opportunities, Marcus Thuram also fluffed his chances and veteran Olivier Giroud made little impact when he came on in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France looked lethargic at times, despite dominating possession, and were perhaps lucky to come across a Dutch side lacking any real threat up front to match the quality of their Virgil van Dijk-marshalled defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands were dismayed, however, when Xavi Simons thought he had scored, only to see the goal disallowed because Denzel Dumfries was deemed to be interfering with play as he stood offside next to goalkeeper Mike Maignan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At times, it almost looked like both sides were happy to settle for a draw, trusting that four points would be enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With already-eliminated Poland to come next for France, while the Dutch have a trickier task against Austria, Didier Deschamps' side look the likelier of the two heavyweights to top Group D and ensure a better draw in the knockout stage. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong basketball player David Muoka has declared he would enter the NBA draft next week, in a bid to become the first athlete from the SAR to make the league.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre, 23, stands at six foot 10 inches, and graduated from Hong Kong's West Island School in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muoka spent the past season playing for Long Island in the NBA's developmental league, the G League, averaging 4.5 points, five rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game in 38 appearances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became the first Hongkonger selected by the G League after being picked third overall by the Capital City Go-Go in last year's draft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The big man spent two years collegiately at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), after previously securing a scholarship at Lamar University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was named Southland Conference Defensive Player of the Year for the 2020-21 season by averaging 5.4 points, 6.8 rebounds and 2.9 blocks a game as a sophomore at Lamar.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Serbian football association threatened to pull the team out of the European Championship over chants made during Wednesday's draw between Albania and Croatia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jovan Surbatovic, the General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia [FSS], told Serbian broadcaster RTS that the country demanded action from authorities over remarks made during the match, including the chant: "Kill, kill, kill the Serb".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surbatovic told RTS the FSS would seek sanctions from UEFA "even at the cost of not continuing the competition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, UEFA, the governing body of European football, said it has opened a probe into the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An ethics and disciplinary inspector has been appointed to "conduct an investigation regarding potential racist and/or discriminatory conduct by supporters" during the match, a statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A probe has also been opened in "relation to the alleged inappropriate behaviour of the Albanian Football Association [FSHF] player Mirlind Daku", the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian media reported that Daku initiated vulgar chants against Serbs and Macedonians. (AFP)

    Lakers to bring in JJ Redick as new head coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="JJ Redick looks on before game four of the 2024 NBA Finals. (Photo: Reuters)" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758392_1_20240621081727.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 J.J. Redick, an NBA television analyst for ESPN, has agreed to a four-year deal to become the new head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, ESPN reported Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Redick, 39, played 15 seasons in the NBA but has no prior coaching experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That didn't matter to the Lakers, who reportedly made Redick their top target after UConn coach Dan Hurley rejected a six-year, $70 million offer to leave the college ranks – where he is a two-time reigning national champion – for Hollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Redick co-hosts a basketball podcast with Lakers star LeBron James, launched last March. James is due to become a free agent at the start of the new league year but can opt into a $51.4 million player option to stay in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lakers fired coach Darvin Ham after two seasons, including an appearance in the Western Conference finals in 2023. Ham posted a 90-74 record but was 9-12 in the playoffs since replacing Frank Vogel in 2022. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain secured a spot in the knockout stages of Euro 2024 with a 1-0 victory over Italy in their heavyweight clash on Thursday, after England struggled to show their credentials in a 1-1 draw with Denmark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three-time winners Spain got the better of reigning champions Italy at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen as Riccardo Calafiori bundled the ball into his own net 10 minutes after half-time to decide the encounter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second win in as many matches for Spain is enough for them to secure top spot in Group B with a game to spare, meaning they already know they will play their last-16 tie in Cologne on June 30 against one of the best third-place finishers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy, meanwhile, are not through yet but a point against Croatia in Leipzig on Monday will clinch second place in the group for Luciano Spalletti's team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sides were meeting at a fifth consecutive European Championship and Spain should have won by a far greater margin as they sought revenge for a defeat on penalties in the semi-finals at Wembley three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made several key saves while Lamine Yamal came close from distance in the second half for La Roja and the outstanding Nico Williams smashed a shot off the bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, England could have secured a last-16 spot as well as they took on Denmark in Frankfurt in Group C but produced an underwhelming performance that leaves more questions over their chances of becoming European champions for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rematch of the Euro 2020 semi-final won by England, it was Gareth Southgate's men who got off to a perfect start when Harry Kane slotted home after Kyle Walker caught Danish defender Victor Kristiansen napping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark, though, were worthy of at least a point and got it thanks to a spectacular strike by Morten Hjulmand before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phil Foden hit the post for England and Denmark's Andreas Christensen came close to a late winner in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a share of the spoils leaves all to play for in the final games of Group C next Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day's other match in Group C also ended in a 1-1 draw, as Luka Jovic snatched a point for Serbia in the 95th minute to hold Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zan Karnicnik had headed Slovenia in front 21 minutes from time in Munich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Serbia kept their fate of reaching the last 16 in their own hands when AC Milan striker Jovic headed in a corner with virtually the last action of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England top the group on four points, two clear of Denmark and Slovenia, and just need a draw when they face Slovenia in Cologne to be sure of qualifying. (AFP)

 Phil Salt blasted an unbeaten 87 as defending champions England cruised to an eight-wicket victory over the West Indies in their T20 World Cup Super Eight clash in St. Lucia on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Opening batsman Salt smashed seven fours and five sixes during a superb 47-ball knock at the Daren Sammy National Stadium as England made a flying start to the second round of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After restricting West Indies to 180-4 off their 20 overs, Salt's knock steered England home with a winning total of 181-2 off 17.3 overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having squeaked into the second stage on net run rate, England will take a huge boost of confidence from beating one of the in-form teams at the tournament to top Group 2 with South Africa, who they meet at the same ground on Friday. (Agencies)

 Zhang Zhizhen on Wednesday became the first Chinese man to reach the quarter-finals of the Halle grass-court tournament with a three-set win over fifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev of Russia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number 42 came through 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 [7/5] after winning the last four points of the deciding tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A really tough match. Last time I lost a third-set tie-break [in Stuttgart last week]. And today again, a third-set tie-break," said the 27-year-old Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was thinking, 'Okay, it's time. The perfect moment to get revenge'," Zhang told atptour.com.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang next faces American Christopher Eubanks, who knocked out defending champion Alexander Bublik 7-6 [7/5], 4-6, 6-3.

  World number four and French Open runner-up Alexander Zverev defeated Lorenzo Sonego of Italy 6-4, 7-6 [7/5].

  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt like it was good tennis and I'm happy to be in the quarters."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa beat the United States by 18 runs in the first T20 World Cup Super 8 game in Antigua on Wednesday as Kagiso Rabada's experience came to the fore at the end of a tense game.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Having struggled on New York's slow pitches in the group stage, South Africa scored freely at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, posting 194-4 on the back of Quinton de Kock's fine knock of 74.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, U.S. opener Andries Gous [80 not out] provided the fireworks along with Harmeet Singh [38] down the order but fast bowler Rabada picked up crucial wickets in his spell of 3-18 and restricted the run rate as the U.S. fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The U.S. had won the toss and opted to field first, picking up the wicket of Reeza Hendricks early but De Kock cut loose as South Africa scored at over 10 runs per over during the powerplay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Kock reached his fifty in 26 balls and shared a 110-run partnership with skipper Aiden Markram off 60 deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harmeet Singh dismissed De Kock when he mistimed a full toss and was caught near the boundary and the all-rounder was on a hat-trick when he had David Miller caught and bowled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markram fell four runs short of his fifty when he chased a wide loose ball and Ali Khan took a sharp diving catch to give Saurabh Netravalkar his second wicket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Netravalkar's superb spell [2-21], the others failed to contain South Africa as Heinrich Klaasen dealt in sixes and scored a quick-fire 36 in an unbroken 53-run partnership with Tristan Stubbs [20] to propel them to 194-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American opener Steven Taylor [24] underlined his intent when he smashed a boundary off the first ball, but after four fours and a six, he fell to Rabada when a mistimed shot was caught at mid-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fast bowler also dismissed Nitish Kumar, who was caught at deep square leg, and U.S. captain Aaron Jones fell for a duck to spinner Keshav Maharaj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gous continued to resist, bringing up his fifty with back-to-back sixes, but the required run rate continued to climb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was hope when Shamsi went for 22 runs in an expensive 18th over but Rabada returned to dismiss Harmeet, conceding only two runs in the penultimate over. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's volleyball team will face host nation France, defending Olympic champions the United States and reigning world champions Serbia in the first stage of the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China's team is eyeing a rebound from its worst ever Olympic performance in Tokyo last time, where the three-time Olympic champions were eliminated in the first stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Paris Olympics will be China's 11th consecutive Olympic appearance in women's volleyball since their debut in Los Angeles in 1984, when they also won gold for the first time, before also standing atop the Olympic podium at Athens 2004 and Rio 2016, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12 qualified teams for Paris were drawn into three pools of four at Wednesday's drawing ceremony in Bangkok, ahead of the FIVB Women's Volleyball Nations League [VNL] Finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from France, the United States, China and Serbia in Pool A, Brazil, Poland, Japan and Kenya were drawn into Pool B, while Italy, Türkiye, the Netherlands and the Dominican Republic are in Pool C. The pool winners, the pool runners-up and the two best-ranked third-placed teams will advance to the quarterfinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic volleyball tournament at Paris 2024 will take place from July 27 to August 11 at the South Paris Arena in the French capital. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hosts Germany became the first team to qualify for the knockout phase of Euro 2024 on Wednesday thanks to a 2-0 win over Hungary, while Scotland drew with Switzerland and Croatia's hopes of progressing were left hanging in the balance after they were held by Albania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany followed up their 5-1 demolition of Scotland in the tournament's opening game by seeing off the Hungarians in Stuttgart, with Jamal Musiala and Ilkay Gundogan scoring either side of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Julian Nagelsmann's team have a maximum six points with one game still to come in Group A, and are certain to progress to the last 16 at least as runners-up in the section.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary put up a fight but the hosts had too much quality in the final third, with Bayern Munich star Musiala firing in the opener midway through the first half after captain Gundogan refused to give up a lost cause in the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany then doubled their lead on 67 minutes as Gundogan, of Barcelona, swept home an assist by Maximilian Mittelstaedt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their recent struggles appear to be a thing of the past, and Germany have now won their opening two games at a World Cup or European Championship for the first time since Euro 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary's hopes of progressing now hang by a thread, while group rivals Switzerland and Scotland played out a 1-1 stalemate in Wednesday's late match in Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland, backed by a large and noisy support, went ahead early on when Callum McGregor cut the ball back for Scott McTominay to score with a shot that went in via a big touch off Fabian Schaer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Switzerland equalised when Xherdan Shaqiri pounced on a stray pass by Anthony Ralston to smash a superb first-time strike high into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss saw Dan Ndoye miss a glorious second-half opportunity and Breel Embolo have a goal disallowed for offside, but Scotland deserved the draw which keeps their hopes alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They might even have won the game, with Grant Hanley hitting the post from a late header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland, quarter-finalists at Euro 2020, may already have enough points to progress but a draw against Germany on Sunday will make sure of second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland, who have not won a match at a major tournament since beating the Swiss 1-0 at Euro 96, can still qualify with a win over Hungary in Stuttgart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Albania's Klaus Gjasula scored at both ends, including a dramatic injury-time equaliser as his side drew 2-2 with Croatia in Hamburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Regan Smith set the 100 metres backstroke world record at the US Olympic trials in Indianapolis on Tuesday, touching the wall first in 57.13 to shave 0.2 seconds off Australian Kaylee McKeown's previous mark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just over a month to go before the Games, Smith's win in the final sealed her place on the US team and sets up a Paris showdown with McKeown, who swam 57.33 in Hungary last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud of myself," Smith said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Backstroke is hard for me sometimes but to fight back like this and get that back means a lot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff was second with a time of 57.91.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith, a three-time Olympic medallist who took bronze in the event at the Tokyo Games, still has two more events to contest at the trials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the second world mark to fall at Indianapolis after Gretchen Walsh smashed the record in the 100 metres butterfly on Saturday, an event in which Smith also swam and set a personal best time. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Edmonton Oilers held off a furious late rally to defeat the Florida Panthers 5-3 and keep their dreams of an improbable Stanley Cup Final comeback alive on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Oilers, down 3-0 after the first three games of the best-of-seven series, built on the momentum from their 8-1 thrashing of Florida on Saturday to claim a hard-fought road win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers now have the chance to level the series with a victory on their home ice in Edmonton in game six on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edmonton are bidding to become only the second team in ice hockey history to overturn a 3-0 series deficit to lift the Stanley Cup after Toronto achieved the feat in 1942.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor McDavid's second goal of the night in the dying seconds sealed a pulsating victory for the Oilers, who are hoping to end Canada's 31-year wait for a Stanley Cup champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor Brown fired the short-handed Oilers into the lead after just 5min 30, snaffling possession near halfway during a Florida power play before coolly rounding Sergei Bobrovsky and tucking away the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oilers doubled their lead early in the second period with a power-play goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They held firm after McDavid's second goal of the night, an empty-netter, ensured a game six on Saturday morning at eight, Hong Kong time. (AFP)

    Baseball legend Willie Mays dies at 93

<div class="itemFullText">
 Willie Mays, the Hall of Fame centerfielder whose all-around skills made him one of greatest baseball players of all time, died on Tuesday at the age of 93, Major League Baseball announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mays, who brought an explosive exuberance to the game in his peak years, died of heart failure, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays played 23 seasons for the New York Giants, San Francisco Giants and New York Mets, from 1951 through 1973.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his prime, he could do it all on the baseball field. Mays was the epitome of what came to be known as a "five-tool player" – meaning he was exceptional at hitting for average, hitting for power, fielding, throwing and base running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Mays' talent was only part of what made him a superstar. He also played with a verve and passion that were discernible even to spectators in the cheap seats. He was known for playing stickball with kids on the streets of Harlem, near the former Polo Grounds where he played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the real games, fans delighted when Mays would sprint with such speed and fury that he would run out from under his hat as he stole a base or chased down a flyball to deep centerfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His snag of a fly ball in the 1954 World Series, sprinting with his back toward home plate some 460 feet away, is known simply as The Catch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays, known as "The Say Hey Kid" because of his standard greeting, was ranked second on The Sporting News' 1998 list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players – behind Babe Ruth and ahead of Ty Cobb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mays was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year of eligibility, won the Most Valuable Player award twice and was named to the all-star team 24 times, a record shared only with Hank Aaron and Stan Musial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he retired, Mays held third place on the all-time home run list with 660, behind Aaron at 755 and Ruth with 714. He was also the first ballplayer to hit 300 homers and steal 300 bases. (Reuters)

    Ronaldo's Portugal scrape Euro 2024 opening win

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal beat the Czech Republic 2-1 to claim a Euro 2024 debut victory on Tuesday but they needed to come from behind with a 92nd-minute winner from youngster Francisco Conceicao.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the section's other clash, Turkey bested Georgia 3-1 in a pulsating match in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roberto Martinez's Portugal qualified at a canter with a 100 percent record, but only just scraped victory in Leipzig in their first match, under driving rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czechs went ahead against the run of play through Lukas Provod's fine strike from the edge of the box after the hour mark, but Robin Hranac's own goal soon pulled Portugal level before Conceicao's winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronaldo was thrice denied by goalkeeper Jindrich Stanek on a record Euros appearance and headed against the post, but was offside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diogo Jota put the rebound into the net but the goal was disallowed after the VAR highlighted Al Nassr striker Ronaldo's infringement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It did not matter for Portugal in the end as 21-year-old Porto winger Conceicao struck from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czechs were left agonising after battling so hard and almost claiming a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It hurts terribly when you work like this for 90 minutes, you give everything and you lose in the end," said Czech goalscorer Provod.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our defenders played an incredible game. We just needed a bit more luck."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A well-supported Turkey started the Euros in entertaining fashion with an end-to-end win over debutants Georgia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid playmaker Arda Guler scored a brilliant goal, along with strikes by Mert Muldur and Kerem Akturkoglu, to delight the masses of Turkish supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia were dangerous after Georges Mikautadze levelled Muldur's superbly hit opener, and struck the woodwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Napoli star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was below his best but despite defeat his team offered enough to give themselves hope for the matches ahead, against the Czech Republic and then Portugal. (AFP)

 Jayson Tatum produced a dazzling 31-point display as the Boston Celtics dominated the Dallas Mavericks 106-88 to clinch a record-breaking 18th NBA championship crown on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Humbled by Dallas in a 38-point game four drubbing on Friday, Boston slammed the door on any chance of a Mavericks fightback to seal a 4-1 series victory at an electric TD Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tatum spearheaded a superb performance at both ends of the floor as Boston pulled clear of their arch-rival Los Angeles Lakers to stand alone with 18 NBA titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The emphatic win came 16 years to the day after Boston's last NBA Finals win – over the Lakers – in 2008. (AFP)

    Sabalenka, Jabeur to miss Olympics over health

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757878_1_20240618083506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Aryna Sabalenka and three-time Grand Slam runner up Ons Jabeur say they will not compete at this year's Paris Olympics in order to prioritise their health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Especially with all the struggles I've been struggling with the last months, I feel I have to take care of my health," Sabalenka told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tennis events at this summer's Games take place on clay between July 27-August 4, meaning a switch back to clay immediately after the grass season and before the hard-court run up to the U.S. Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belarus' Sabalenka, 26, lost to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the French Open quarter-finals earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is set to return to action this week in Berlin, having suffered from a stomach illness at Roland-Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was the worst experience I had in my life on court," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tunisian Jabeur, 29, underwent surgery last year on her right knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After consulting with my medical team regarding attending to the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body's adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeapordize the rest of my season," Jabeur said on her social media accounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Olympics," she added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Otago Highlanders back Connor Garden-Bachop has died aged 25 after an unspecified "medical event", New Zealand Rugby said Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Connor passed away on Monday following a medical event, and rugby's collective focus at this time is on supporting his family," New Zealand Rugby said in a statement without giving further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garden-Bachop, the son of former All Black Stephen Bachop, played for the Highlanders in this season's Super Rugby competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winger, who also played representative rugby for the Maori All Blacks, comes from a family of New Zealand internationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His mother, Susan Garden-Bachop, played for New Zealand's Black Ferns, while his uncle Graeme Bachop also played for the All Blacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garden-Bachop, who was the father of twin girls, made his debut for the Highlanders in 2021, going on to make 30 appearances in Super Rugby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club had said he was one of several players not returning next season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent post on social media platform Instagram, Garden-Bachop praised the Dunedin-based team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you @highlandersteam for an unforgettable five years," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you to everyone in the south for making me feel at home, and thank you to the boys I have been honoured to share the field with, it's been a pleasure, I will miss you all. Till next time." (AFP)

    Mbappe breaks nose as France win Euro 2024 opener

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kylian Mbappe leaves the pitch with what turned out to be a broken nose. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757872_1_20240618064027.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappe came off late on with a broken nose as France edged Austria 1-0 in their opening game at Euro 2024 on Monday, after Slovakia inflicted a surprise 1-0 defeat on Belgium and Romania beat Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France, the runners-up at the 2022 World Cup, are one of the standout contenders for European Championship glory in Germany, but they did not entirely convince against a hard-running Austria side and needed a Maximilian Woeber own goal to claim the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defender Woeber diverted Mbappe's cutback into his own net seven minutes before half-time in Duesseldorf to decide the Group D game and leave France level on three points at the top of the section with the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe may have made the goal, but it was otherwise a difficult night for the new Real Madrid signing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was denied twice by Austrian goalkeeper Patrick Pentz in the first half and failed to hit the target from a glorious chance when sent clean through 10 minutes after the restart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappe then had to come off in the 90th minute after being left with a bloodied nose in an accidental collision with Austrian defender Kevin Danso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source close to the France captain confirmed shortly after the game that his nose was broken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgium may no longer rank among the leading contenders but they were not expected to start with a defeat against Slovakia in Frankfurt, where Ivan Schranz of Slavia Prague scored the only goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schranz struck in the seventh minute, firing home the rebound after Belgian goalkeeper Koen Casteels had saved from Juraj Kucka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an especially frustrating day for Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku, who missed a host of chances and had a late equaliser controversially disallowed by VAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had already had one effort ruled out for a marginal offside call before he swept home a Lois Openda cutback in the 86th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time, however, the goal was disallowed because the ball had brushed Openda's hand at the beginning of the move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romania won at a major international tournament for the first time in 24 years as they beat Ukraine 3-0 with the help of two errors from goalkeeper Andriy Lunin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Nicolae Stanciu's magnificent long-range strike – following a misplaced Lunin clearance – gave Romania, backed by the vast majority of the Munich crowd, a first-half lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Razvan Marin's shot from distance then skipped under Lunin as Romania turned the screw with two more goals before the hour, Denis Dragus tapping home the third. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The star of French rugby and pin-up for this summer's Paris Olympics Antoine Dupont has called for an end to the "macho" cliches linked to the game and "stop homophobia in our sport."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old, who was World Rugby men's 15s Player of the Year in 2021, made the comment in an interview in the next edition of the French LGBTQ magazine Tetu, to be published on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only one professional rugby player in France, Jeremy Clamy-Edroux who plays for third division Rouen, has publicly declared his homosexuality but Dupont said there were certainly more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I very much doubt that there is only one gay on the pitch!" the Toulouse and France scrum-half said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal is for all players to feel good about their sexuality and to be accepted by others."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if rugby can be seen as macho, we are very open-minded, and today I think we are all capable of accepting each other's sexual orientations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really need to repeat it, communicate about it, so that everyone definitely feels comfortable with it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupont captained France in last year's World Cup and is poised to line up for the sevens team at this summer's Games. (AFP)

 Newly minted world record-holder Gretchen Walsh punched her ticket to the Paris Olympics on Sunday with a victory in the women's 100 metres butterfly in a swift time of 55.31 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old American couldn't match the astonishing 55.18 she threw down in the semi-finals of the US Olympic swimming trials to shatter Sweden's Sarah Sjoestroem's previous mark of 55.48 -- but she clocked the second-fastest time ever and secured a berth at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still in shock," Walsh said. "I don't even know what to say. Making the team was the biggest goal, but getting a world record was absolutely insanity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walsh's mark in the butterfly on Saturday was the third world record set in women's swimming over the past couple of months, coming on the back of Canadian Summer McIntosh's effort in the 400 metres individual medley and Australian star Ariarne Titmus' blistering time in the 200 metres freestyle.

    Vu wins LPGA Meijer Classic after playoff thriller

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lilia Vu staged a sensational final round charge before snatching victory in a playoff to win the LPGA Meijer Classic in Michigan on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vu fired a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 at Blythefield Country Club in suburban Grand Rapids to finish with a 72-hole 16-under-par aggregate of 272.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was good enough to send the two-time major champion into a sudden-death playoff with Lexi Thompson and Australia's Grace Kim, who wilted over the final 18 holes after leading by five shots after Saturday's third round. Kim advanced to the playoff after a closing one-over 73.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three women all grabbed birdies on the first playoff hole, the par-five 18th, and then repeated the trio of birdies after replaying 18 for the second playoff hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On both occasions Kim had difficult eagle putts to snatch victory but was unable to convert either. The third playoff hole headed to the par-five fourth, and it was Vu who kept her nerve as the tension mounted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old from California looked to be in trouble after sending her second shot into a greenside bunker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a brilliant sand wedge left her with a short birdie putt, and after Thompson and Kim missed their birdie chances, she duly rolled in the six-footer to clinch the fifth LPGA title of her career. (AFP)

    DeChambeau edges McIlroy by one stroke to win US Open

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryson DeChambeau captured his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy by one stroke in a dramatic back-nine duel at Pinehurst.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old American, who also won the 2020 US Open, fired a one-over-par 71 to finish on six-under-par 274 while McIlroy shot 69 to stand on 275 after 72 holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, thwarted in a bid to end a 10-year major win drought, led by two strokes with five holes to play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland made bogeys on three of the last four holes to help hand the trophy to DeChambeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a collapse mindful of Greg Norman's epic 1996 last-round loss to Nick Faldo at Pinehurst, McIlroy missed par putts from 2.5 feet at the par-3 17th and just inside four feet at the par-4 18th -- tension-packed misses for bogeys that left McIlroy one behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau found dirt and weeds left and a bunker at 18 but blasted his third shot to four feet and sank his pressure-packed putt for the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raising his arms in triumph, DeChambeau screamed and jumped for joy, then paid tribute to the late Payne Stewart, the 1999 US Open winner at Pinehurst who died only a few months later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's Payne right there, baby," DeChambeau said into a television camera, pointing to a pin of Stewart on his cap. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="England's Jude Bellingham celebrates scoring their first goal. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757720_1_20240617081811.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England got their quest for a first major tournament title in 58 years off to a winning start as Jude Bellingham's header was enough to beat Serbia 1-0, while the Netherlands grabbed a late 2-1 win over Poland on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Christian Eriksen enjoyed a fairytale return to the European Championship, three years after suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch, by scoring the opening goal, but Denmark were held 1-1 by Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England had been hyped as one of the favourites for the tournament as Gareth Southgate aims to finally steer a richly-talented generation to glory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, they left plenty of room for improvement in a flat tournament debut in Gelsenkirchen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bellingham was the exception as the Real Madrid midfielder confirmed his status as one of the world's rising stars with a man-of-the-match display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first half showed why we can score goals against any team and the second half showed why we can keep clean sheets against any team," said Bellingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old became the first European player to grace three major tournaments before turning 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he capped a brilliant individual display with the only goal when he headed in Bukayo Saka's deflected cross on 13 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were forced to see out a nervy finale as Jordan Pickford turned over Dusan Vlahovic's dipping drive before Harry Kane headed away Veljko Birmancevic's goalbound shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the Netherlands, Wout Weghorst struck in the 83rd minute, just two minutes after coming on as a substitute, to secure an opening Group D victory against Poland, who were without the injured Robert Lewandowski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the Poland supporters whose voices echoed around the Volksparkstadion when Adam Buksa headed their team in front early on, but Cody Gakpo levelled an entertaining encounter before the half-hour mark with the aid of a deflection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gakpo, Memphis Depay and Denzel Dumfries all went close as the missed chances piled up for the Oranje, and Ronald Koeman's men looked to be running out of ideas until Weghorst swooped to slot home a deserved winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eriksen collapsed during Denmark's opening game at the delayed Euro 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exactly 1,100 days on, the Manchester United midfielder put the Danes in front with a sweet strike in Stuttgart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do think this time my story at the Euros is very different from the last one," said Eriksen. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong windsurfer Hayley Chan has won a bronze medal in the wing foil European Championships in Switzerland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She defeated French windsurfer Anais Mai Desjardins by 11 points in the final to come third, with two Italian athletes above Chan on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan, 33, beat fellow SAR athlete Ngai Wai-yan in the previous round. Ngai finished fifth in the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Windsurfing Association of Hong Kong, China said this was Chan's first go at the European Championships, having twice been an Asian champion. She's also a two-time Olympian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association said two others it sponsored in the race, Rafeek Kikabhoy and Chow Tsz-hei, finished 13th and 18th respectively in the men's race. Another Hongkonger, Era Lin, meanwhile, came 26th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes will return to the SAR after the competition to prepare for the wing foil world cup in August, the association said.

    DeChambeau moves three shots clear at US Open

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bryson DeChambeau lines up a putt at the seventh hole. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757636_1_20240616093816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryson DeChambeau brushed off hip issues to move three shots clear at the top of the US Open third round leaderboard on Saturday, setting up a potential mouth-watering showdown with world number three Rory McIlroy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On another steamy afternoon at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, DeChambeau recovered from an early bogey and troublesome hip that required treatment mid-round to return a three-under 67 to lead Frenchman Matthieu Pavon (69), Patrick Cantlay (70) and McIlroy (69) by three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sitting a further two back and five off the pace are Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (70) and young Swede Ludvig Aberg (73), who had held a one shot lead after the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Trying to stay in the moment, obviously hip wasn't feeling great but luckily I've got a good team and we're going to go figure that out after," said DeChambeau. "I just got two hips that are not fantastic just because of the speed training I do that's the consequences of it but I'll be ready tomorrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had it for a long time now. It's just something that popped up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau will be partnered with Pavon for Sunday's final round but it is McIlroy, paired with Cantlay, who he will share the spotlight with as the former-U.S. Open winners and two of golf's most intriguing figures grapple for the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy, bidding to end a decade-long major drought, may be one of golf's most popular figures but the big-hitting DeChambeau has evolved into one of the most entertaining and has enjoyed the backing of huge crowds at Pinehurst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be some golf politics and bragging rights at stake on Sunday with 2020 U.S. Open winner DeChambeau now playing on the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour and McIlroy, long one of the most vocal critics of the renegade circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will mark the 10th time McIlroy has appeared in the top three going into the final round of a major while DeChambeau has played some of the best golf at the biggest events, finishing runner-up at last month's PGA Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking forward to another Sunday in the mix at a major," said McIlroy, who won the last of his four majors at the PGA Championship in 2014. "Awesome opportunity, really excited to be in the position I am in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is what we practice for, this is what we dream of, so really excited for the opportunity, going to go out there tomorrow and give it my all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau broke away from the leading pack with a birdie at the 10th but on his way to the 11th was stretched out on the ground having work done on his hip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any concerns about fitness were quickly dispelled when DeChambeau stepped onto the tee and hammered his longest drive of day at 359-yards before draining a 13-footer for back-to-back birdies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DeChambeau extended his advantage to four with his third birdie in five holes at the 14th but just when it appeared he might run away from the field was pulled back with a double bogey at the 16th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old responded immediately, rolling in a 12-footer for his sixth birdie triggering wild cheers and chants of "USA, USA".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was amazing," gushed DeChambeau of the fan support. "Man, they riled me up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It just gives me a spike in my adrenaline and allows me to focus more on delivering for the fans and for myself and for my family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It just inspires me." (Reuters)

    England stay alive in T20 World Cup with rain-hit win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning champions England maintained their bid to reach the second round of the T20 World Cup with a 41-run victory in a must-win group game against Namibia in Antigua on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anything other than an England win would have seen Jos Buttler's men knocked out and they were left fearing an early exit when rain delayed the scheduled start by three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, in a match eventually reduced from 11 to 10 overs per side by a fresh downpour, collapsed to 13-2 after losing the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a stand of 56 between the Yorkshire duo of Harry Brook (47 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (31) revived England's innings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Namibia were left with a target of 126 under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method for rain-interrupted matches. But the non-Test nation were never up with the required run-rate and finished on 84-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory took England level on points with Scotland in Group B but with a superior net run-rate – the tie-breaker for teams on equal points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, however, could still be knocked out should Scotland achieve a stunning upset win over already-qualified Australia in the final Group B fixture in St Lucia later on Saturday, or if that game ends in a no-result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Ruben Trumpelmann bowled England captain Buttler, one of the world's best white-ball batsman, for a four-ball duck as he nipped one back sharply off the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran all-rounder David Wiese then produced a magnificent slower ball to have Phil Salt, England's other opener, caught behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain stopped play with England 82-3 off eight overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the match resumed, Brook did the damage in an over from Namibia teenage paceman Jack Brassell, which cost 19 runs, before Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone struck three sixes between them in the last over from Trumpelmann (2-31).

  <br/>
  The already-eliminated Namibia retired opener Nikolaas Davin out for 18 to allow the big-hitting Wiese to come in at 44-1 off six overs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even with the 39-year-old Wiese – who holed out in the last over of his final international appearance – hitting two sixes and two fours in a 12-ball 27, Namibia finished well-short of their target. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy recovered from conceding the fastest goal in the competition's history to get their defence of the European Championship title off to a winning start on Saturday as they came back to beat Albania 2-1 in front of a partisan crowd.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nedim Bajrami stunned the Italians and delighted a huge Albanian support in Dortmund as he smashed in the opener after just 23 seconds, his strike pulverising the previous record for the quickest goal at the Euros of 67 seconds by Dmitri Kirichenko of Russia in 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet Italy's response to falling behind was quick too, as Alessandro Bastoni headed the Azzurri level on 11 minutes and Nicolo Barella's glorious effort put them ahead just past the quarter-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From then on Luciano Spalletti's team looked much more assured, although they really should have won by a greater margin rather than face an anxious finale as Albania pushed for an equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their performance – the first 23 seconds apart – was largely encouraging before an enticing showdown with fellow heavyweights Spain in nearby Gelsenkirchen next Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy are in some ways an unknown quantity coming into this tournament, with the reigning champions having also missed the last two World Cups and failed to fully convince during qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only five of Italy's line-up at kick-off here started the final of the last Euros three years ago, with a new-look team featuring Bologna centre-back Riccardo Calafiori winning just his third cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albania, though, are appearing at just their second major tournament having also gone to Euro 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The novelty of the experience for them helps explain why the home of Borussia Dortmund was a sea of excitable Albanian fans decked in red and black who made up the vast majority of the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They could hardly believe it when their team, coached by the Brazilian former Arsenal and Barcelona left-back Sylvinho, opened the scoring almost straight from kick-off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's Federico Dimarco took a throw from the left-back position but played it loosely back into his own box. Bastoni was caught on the back foot, and Bajrami – who plays in Italy for Sassuolo – pounced to control and fire past Gianluigi Donnarumma at the goalkeeper's near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a similar start to Italy's last European Championship match, when Luke Shaw put England ahead inside two minutes in the final at Wembley in 2021 before the Azzurri came back to win on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time they drew level when Dimarco and Lorenzo Pellegrini played a short corner routine on the left before the latter crossed for Inter Milan centre-back Bastoni to head in at the back post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy had regained their composure and soon went in front on 16 minutes, a Jasir Asani clearance dropping straight to another Inter player in Barella, who made the cleanest of contacts at the edge of the area to send a first-time shot past goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They should have added to their lead before the interval, with Davide Frattesi hitting the post after meeting a lovely reverse pass by Gianluca Scamacca in the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scamacca was then denied by Strakosha, while Fedrico Chiesa curled a shot just wide on the hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy then sat back, but Albania did not manage another attempt on target and the second-lowest ranked nation in the competition could not find an equaliser despite their best efforts late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Rey Manaj came closest after getting in behind in the 90th minute, but he could not beat Donnarumma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Spain made a dream start to Euro 2024 as Alvaro Morata scored in a statement 3-0 victory over Croatia in Berlin, with Lamine Yamal becoming the youngest player in the competition's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time European champions have often been accused of being toothless in attack during recent major tournaments, but produced an eye-catching display at the Olympiastadion to cut apart a disappointing Croatia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morata broke the deadlock in the 29th minute with his seventh Euros goal, moving joint-third on the all-time list alongside Alan Shearer and Antoine Griezmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fabian Ruiz added a second shortly afterwards with a wonderful individual strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal made his mark with the assist for Dani Carvajal to effectively kill the game as a contest on the stroke of half-time, while Croatia striker Bruno Petkovic missed a late penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This repeat of last year's Nations League final, won by Spain on penalties after a 0-0 draw, suggests La Roja are capable of contending for a record-breaking fourth European Championship title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World Cup semi-finalists Croatia, though, have it all to do if they are to reach the knockout phase for a fifth consecutive major tournament, with games against Albania and holders Italy to come in a difficult Group B.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luka Modric, so often their inspiration, was substituted midway through the second half by coach Zlatko Dalic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain boss Luis de la Fuente named an exciting starting XI, including wingers Nico Williams and Yamal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Barcelona starlet, 16 years and 338 days old, beat the previous record for youngest player at a Euros held by Polish international Kacper Kozlowski, who played at Euro 2020 at 17 years and 246 days old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia enjoyed the vast majority of support from the stands, with their fans holding up one huge banner during their national anthem, reading "When we get going, heaven and earth will burn".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Croatia started slowly, as Spain dominated possession in trademark fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain also showed their increasing versatility under De la Fuente with their first goal, as one excellent through ball from inside his own half by Ruiz sent Morata clean through and the captain made no mistake with a cool finish past a stranded Dominik Livakovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruiz put Spain in total control just three minutes later, jinking past two Croatia defenders inside the box before shooting through the legs of Josip Sutalo and into the bottom corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia almost pulled one back immediately as the game started to echo the end-to-end nature of the two teams' thrilling last-16 clash at Euro 2020, won 5-3 by Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon got down quickly to keep out Marcelo Brozovic's shot and Lovro Majer could only find the side-netting from the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia continued to create chances, as Josko Gvardiol's cross-cum-shot narrowly avoided both Ante Budimir in the centre and the far post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But full-back Carvajal, who scored the opening goal in Real Madrid's Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund earlier this month, put the game to bed in first-half added time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamal collected the ball after a corner was cleared and curled a delicious cross into the middle for Carvajal to stretch and stab home on the volley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatia tried to press forward early in the second period but left spaces for Spain to exploit and Yamal was denied another record for youngest Euros scorer when Livakovic produced a fine save to turn away his low effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Cucurella, a controversial selection by De la Fuente at left-back, made a goal-saving block to prevent Josip Stanisic giving Croatia hope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Petkovic thought he had pulled one back late on when he tapped in after his penalty was saved by Simon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the goal was ruled out by VAR for encroachment by Ivan Perisic as Spain added a clean sheet to an almost perfect outing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China have posted their third straight win in the FIVB Women’s Volleyball Nations League being held in Hong Kong, rallying past the world’s top-ranked side Turkey on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China lost the first two sets 21-25, 17-25 before staging their comeback, taking the next three sets 25-21, 25-23, 15-13 to win 3-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Cai Bin called it a team victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China next play Poland on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese women’s volleyball team have already qualified for the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss by Turkey means Brazil have replaced them as the world’s No 1 team.

    Aberg chases win in US Open debut, Scheffler struggles
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ludvig Aberg could become the first golfer in 111 years to win the US Open on his debut. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757610_1_20240616003007.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ludvig Aberg, trying to become the first US Open debut winner since 1913, carried a one-stroke lead into Saturday's third round at Pinehurst, where top-ranked Scottie Scheffler was 11 strokes adrift.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's sixth-ranked Aberg stood on five-under 135 as he awaited a 3:35 p.m. (1935 GMT) start alongside 2020 US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a runner-up effort in last month's PGA Championship, DeChambeau was among eight of 12 LIV Golf starters among the 74 players who made the cut for the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also one stroke off the pace with DeChambeau on 136 were ninth-ranked American Patrick Cantlay and Belgium's Thomas Detry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland was another shot back on 137 with American Tony Finau and France's Matthieu Pavon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner takes US$4.3 million and the runner-up a hefty US$2.32 million from the record US$21.5 million purse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Aberg, runner-up at April's Masters in his major debut, could carry off a bit of history as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not since 20-year-old American amateur Francis Ouimet upset Britain's Harry Vardon and Ted Ray at The Country Club in his hometown of Brookline, Massachusetts, some 111 years ago has a player won the US Open on his debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old Swede has had triumphs on the US PGA Tour and DP World Tour since turning professional a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A major reason for his lead at punishing Pinehurst, with its dome-shaped elevated greens and dirt and weeds waste areas, is that he leads all players in both driving accuracy at 93 percent and greens in regulation at 83 percent, mainly avoiding the course's two major danger zones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best any Swedish player has done in a US Open is fourth, a feat managed by Niclas Fasth, Robert Karlson and Henrik Stenson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scheffler, the hottest golfer entering the week and a huge favourite, was six-over and 11 strokes back after a bogey at the par-4 fourth, finding native area left off the tee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler made the cut on the number following a 74 on Friday but was 1-over after seven holes on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler was the first player since Tom Watson in 1980 to win five US PGA Tour events before the US Open, taking the fifth last week at the Memorial, and has 12 top-10 finishes in 13 events this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The usually stoic and calm Scheffler, however, could feel the frustration at Pinehurst's unique challenge, flipping his putter in the air and letting it fall after one near miss on Friday and also slamming down his driver after a woefully errant tee shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cantlay, in his best spot after 36 holes in 30 major starts, has a chance to move past Collin Morikawa for the final spot on the US team for the Paris Olympics but needs no worse than a two-way share of second to do it. Four other Americans must win to make the squad for France. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Kevin Campbell once said of Arsenal "to actually play for the team I supported was a dream come true." Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757612_1_20240616004648.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Premier League striker Kevin Campbell has died aged 54, his former clubs Arsenal and Everton announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Campbell, who died after a short illness, holds the record for most Premier League goals, 83, by a player never to win an international cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone at Arsenal Football is devastated to hear of the death of our much-loved former player Kevin Campbell," said Arsenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell joined the Gunners as a schoolboy in 1985, making his first-team debut in 1988. He went on to play 228 times for Arsenal scoring 59 goals and winning a league title, an FA Cup, a European Cup Winners Cup and a League Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To actually play for the team I supported was a dream come true," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 164 games for Everton he scored 51 goals, including nine in five games which saved them from relegation in 1999.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone at Everton Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of the Club's most popular and much-loved former strikers, Kevin Campbell," they said on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell, who also played for Leicester, Leyton Orient, Nottingham Forest, Trabzonspor, West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff, said one of his favourite memories in football was scoring the winner in the 2000 Merseyside derby, Everton's last victory at Anfield for 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was at the Kop End and my view, which will live with me until the day I die, is the Blues in the Kop going crazy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January 2001, manager Walter Smith made Campbell Everton's first black captain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He made me the first black captain of Everton, which is something that I'm so proud of," Campbell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campbell moved to West Brom in January 2005 and was part of their "great escape," as they became the first club bottom of the Premier League at Christmas to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His son, Tyrese Campbell, is a striker who has just been released by Championship side Stoke City after seven seasons at the club. (AFP)

    Switzerland sink Hungary to make strong start at Euros

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A cool chip from Breel Embolo in stoppage-time seals the win for Switzerland. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757608_1_20240615233808.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Switzerland made a flying start at Euro 2024 as Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer scored their first international goals in a 3-1 win against Hungary on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murat Yakin's side raced into a two-goal lead by half-time in Cologne to kick off their Group A campaign in impressive fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duah opened the scoring in only his second international appearance after making his debut earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-born 27-year-old, who plays for Bulgarian club Ludogorets Razgrad, holds dual citizenship with Ghana and Switzerland, who will be relieved he opted to represent them on the evidence of this dynamic display.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After providing the assist for Duah's opener, Bologna midfielder Aebischer netted his maiden Switzerland goal with an eye-catching long-range strike just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barnabas Varga's seventh goal in nine starts for Hungary set up a tense finale, but Breel Embolo struck in stoppage-time to seal the points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following reports of a rift between Yakin and his players over tactics, Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka insisted on Friday that the air had been cleared in time for the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recent dinner with Yakin featuring "plenty of wine" healed the wounds and the Bayer Leverkusen midfielder showed his support for the manager with an influential performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland beat France on penalties in the last 16 at Euro 2020 before losing a shoot-out to Spain in the quarter-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will hope to emulate that memorable run after enjoying a perfect start in a group that also includes hosts Germany, who thrashed Scotland 5-1 in the tournament opener on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland face Scotland in their second game on Wednesday, while Hungary play Germany the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary boss Marco Rossi had urged his side to embrace the pressure of being ranked as one of Europe's emerging forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But their dismal first half proved fatal, showing that comparisons to Hungary's 'Mighty Magyars', who finished as runners-up at the 1954 World Cup, were rather premature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland needed just 12 minutes to puncture Hungarian optimism in ruthless fashion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aebischer slipped a perfectly weighted pass through the heart of the Hungary defence, sending Duah through to plant a clinical low finish past Peter Gulacsi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duah's celebrations were initially curtailed by an erroneous offside flag, but the decision was corrected by the VAR as Switzerland's players mobbed their unheralded hero.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruben Vargas should have sent the roiling red sea of Switzerland fans into ecstasy again moments later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vargas intercepted Milos Kerkez's wayward pass on the edge of the area, but the winger was left holding his head in frustration after his shot cannoned off Gulacsi's shoulder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Swiss were on a roll and Willi Orban wasted a golden opportunity to halt their momentum with a close-range header that was straight at Yann Sommer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a crucial moment as Aebischer doubled Switzerland's lead on the stroke of half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Hungary sat too deep, a flowing Swiss move climaxed with Aebischer curling a superb strike into the far corner from 25 yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varga gave Hungary a lifeline in the 66th minute, just moments after he had missed a sitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dominik Szoboszlai's pin-point cross found Varga and his diving header whistled past Sommer from six yards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary pushed hard for an equaliser, but Embolo came off the bench to chip a cool finish over Gulacsi in the final seconds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic dazzled and the Dallas Mavericks dominated Boston 122-84 on Friday to fend off elimination in the NBA Finals, denying the Celtics a sweep in the best-of-seven championship series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Doncic scored 29 points and Kyrie Irving added 21 for the Mavs, who snapped the Celtics' 10-game playoff winning streak but still have a mountain to climb as they try to become the first team to rally from a 3-0 deficit to win an NBA playoff series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now down 3-1, Dallas will try to stop the Celtics celebrating an 18th title when they travel to Boston for game five on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We knew we have to get it, we can't lose no more," Doncic said. "As we always say, we're going to believe until the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic, roundly criticised after game three when he fouled out with more than four minutes left and could only watch as the Mavs' comeback bid fell short, was dialled in on the defensive end as Dallas held the Celtics to 36.2 percent shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston star Jayson Tatum scored 15 points and Jaylen Brown had just 10 as the Mavs posted the third-largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tim Hardaway Jr added 15 points off the bench for Dallas and 20-year-old rookie Dereck Lively added 11 – incuding his first career three-pointer – as the Mavs topped 100 points for the first time in the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dallas handed Boston their first road defeat of these playoffs and ended their bid for the 10th 4-0 sweep in Finals history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Doncic and Irving leading the way, Dallas out-scored Boston 22-12 in the paint in the first quarter to build a 34-21 lead – the Mavs' highest-scoring quarter of the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no let-up in the second, the Mavs dominating every facet of the game on the way to a 61-35 halftime lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic scored 25 points in the first half, Irving had 11 and their supporting cast stepped up, too, Lively electrifying the crowd at American Airlines Center with his three-pointer, followed by an alley-oop dunk on the next possession in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think our energy was way higher," Doncic said. "Everybody was locked in defensive end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics, harried at every turn, made 14 of their 41 three-point attempts. They were out-scored 60-26 in the paint and out-rebounded 52-31 – Dallas' dominance on the boards leading to a 16-2 edge in second-chance points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown went to the bench with 2:11 left in the first half after picking up his third foul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doncic, meanwhile, answered critics with an intense effort on both ends of the floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stripped by Jrue Holiday on a drive to the basket Doncic dived for the loose ball and swatted it to Irving, who played it back to him for a layup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fouled on the play, Doncic made the free throw to put Dallas up 43-25 midway through the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mavs were up 92-57 when Doncic and Irving checked out of the game to a standing ovation with 1:29 left in the third quarter, Irving offering Doncic a congratulatory embrace on the bench.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla pulled his starters late in the third, their attention already turning to game five and their next chance to break out of a tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA titles. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of spectators on Saturday flocked to the Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade to watch the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races in spite of the heavy rain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 competitors, representing over 170 teams from 12 countries or regions, are taking part in the two-day sporting event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Singaporean rower said he was enjoying the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a new experience for us because we don't normally race out in the sea. I think in Singapore, we normally train in the reservoir, so the water is much calmer. I think it's a totally new experience for us," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's very great, very lively. I think we do not have such big international competitions back in Singapore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mainland tourist, Mr Shao, said the showers hadn't dampened the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The weather is cool. It is nice to have the dragon boat races here, whether it be from the spectators' or rowers' point of view. Probably because the race venue is close to the city centre, there are many tourists here. I think everyone can feel that Hong Kong is promoting Chinese traditional culture," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The races were organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong, China Dragon Boat Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fireworks display over Victoria Harbour scheduled for 8 pm was cancelled in light of the three Amber Rainstorm Warning Signals issued by the Observatory on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Clinical Germany thumped Scotland 5-1 in their Euro 2024 tournament opener on Friday with the host nation scoring three first-half goals and enjoying a man advantage after Ryan Porteous received a straight red card before the break.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Florian Wirtz opened the scoring in the 10th minute when he connected with a cross that goalkeeper Angus Gunn could only palm against the post and watch helplessly as it rolled into the net during a match in which Germany dominated possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-times European champions doubled their lead in the 19th minute at the Munich Football Arena after a series of passes ended with Kai Havertz picking out Jamal Musiala who took a touch in the area and fired into the roof of the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It went from bad to worse for Scotland when Porteous was sent off for a foul on Ilkay Gundogan in the penalty area with Havertz converting from the spot to make it 3-0. Substitute Niclas Fuellkrug fired home a fourth late in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland did get on the scoresheet late in the match through an Antonio Rudiger own goal before Emre Can rounded out the scoring for the hosts. Germany next play Hungary in Group A while Scotland must regroup to take on Switzerland. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aleksander Barkov and Sergei Bobrovsky led the way as the Florida Panthers moved within a victory of their first Stanley Cup title, holding on to beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 in Game 3 of the final Thursday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Game 4 is on Sunday morning, Hong Kong time. The Panthers have not won a championship since coming into the NHL in 1993.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barkov set up a goal and scored another, while Bobrovsky made 32 saves. Sam Reinhart, Sam Bennett and Vladimir Tarasenko also scored, with the Panthers pouncing on turnovers and quieting a fired up Edmonton crowd until the Oilers mounted a third-period rally that fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will take a comeback done just four times in league playoff history and once in the final – back in 1942 – to bring the Cup back to Canada. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Cantlay racked up six birdies and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy played a bogey-free round on their ways to 5-under-par 65s to share the lead through the first round of the U.S. Open on Thursday in Pinehurst.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cantlay established the lead early in the day, and McIlroy, the 2011 champion, had birdies on two of the final three holes playing in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Ludvig Aberg shot 66 to hold third place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Golfers had to negotiate the tricky greens on Pinehurst No. 2 along with the increasing heat of the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cantlay began the round on No. 10. He got better later in the round, with four birdies on the first eight holes on the front side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Feeling good about my game," Cantlay said. "I've been working hard. I have to just keep putting myself in the fairway, giving myself opportunities and I did a good job of that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time Cantlay has led or co-led in a major.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a rough day for Tiger Woods, who shot 74 with two birdies – both on the par-5 holes – and six bogeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler had a mundane 71. Defending champion Wyndham Clark managed just one birdie during his round of 73. (Reuters)

    England thrash Oman to revive T20 World Cup campaign

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England thrashed Oman by eight wickets as the reigning champions revived their T20 World Cup campaign with a record-breaking success in Antigua on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Needing a heavy win to bolster their net run-rate [NRR] as they attempt to overhaul Scotland in the race to qualify for the second-round Super Eights, England dismissed Oman for just 47.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England then made 50-2 in a mere 3.1 overs, captain Jos Buttler 24 not out and Jonny Bairstow, who hit the winning boundary, unbeaten on eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This overwhelming Group B victory meant England recorded the largest win in T20 World Cup history in terms of balls remaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oman had no answer to England's combination of spin and pace, leg-break bowler Adil Rashid taking 4-11 from his four overs, while express quicks Jofra Archer and Mark Wood both had figures of 3-12 in an innings that ended with nearly seven overs to spare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Number seven Shoaib Khan [11] was the only Oman batsman to reach double figures after Buttler won the toss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Significantly, England's NRR climbed to 3.081, better than Scotland's 2.16. England, however, stayed third on three points, behind Scotland's five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already-eliminated Oman, who ended the tournament having lost all four of the games, just scraped past the record lowest completed total of 39 at any T20 World Cup, posted by fellow-non Test nation Uganda against co-hosts West Indies in Guyana last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, beaten by Australia after their group game with Scotland was abandoned due to rain, play Namibia on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia and Scotland, however, will meet on Sunday after England have completed their group games. (AFP)

 The Boston Celtics took a major step forward towards a record 18th NBA championship with a decisive win over the Dallas Mavericks in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, taking a 3-0 lead in the series.
 <br>
  <br/>
  No NBA team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Playing on home court, the Mavericks mounted a spirited comeback in the fourth quarter with Luka Dončić taking 27 points, six assists and six rebounds for the Mavs, while Dallas' Kyrie Irving led all scorers with 35 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the Mavericks' attempts to turn the tide, the Celtics managed to hang on for a 106-99 win.
  <br/>

  Game 4 is scheduled for Friday in Dallas. (Agencies)

 India qualified for the Super Eight stage of the T20 World Cup with a seven-wicket win over the United States on Wednesday, with a fifty by Suryakumar Yadav and Arshdeep Singh's four-wicket haul helping them clinch their third win in a row.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Put in to bat first, the Americans struggled as Arshdeep [4-9] dismissed Shayan Jahangir [0] and Andries Gous [2] in the first over. But Steven Taylor [24] and Nitish Kumar [27] set the stage for a competitive total of 110-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India also struggled at the start, with Saurabh Netravalkar sending openers Virat Kohli [0] and Rohit Sharma [3] back early. But Yadav [50 not out] and Shivam Dube [31 not out] steadied the innings and got India over the line with 10 balls to spare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The U.S., second in Group A with four points after suffering their first loss in three matches, will also ensure qualification for the next round if they beat Ireland on Friday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Basketball Hall of Famer Jerry West, a star guard from the 1960s for the Los Angeles Lakers whose profile on the court inspired the design of the NBA logo, died on Wednesday aged 86.
 <br>
  <br/>
  West played for the Lakers from 1960 until 1974, winning his only NBA title as a player in 1972 while being named as an All-Star for all 14 seasons in the league.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won eight NBA titles as an executive – six with the Lakers and twice with the Golden State Warriors in the Stephen Curry era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After leaving the Warriors in 2017, he joined the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive, which announced his passing. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The former head coach of the SAR football team, Jørn Andersen, was on Wednesday confirmed as the new manager of second-tier mainland side Yunnan Yukun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Norwegian, 61, quit the Hong Kong, China squad late last month, saying he'd received an offer he "couldn't refuse".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had taken the SAR to its first AFC Cup in more than 50 years, as well as leading the under-23 squad to its first-ever semifinals at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an announcement on social media, Yunnan Yukun described Andersen as an experienced coach with strong leadership skills, saying he can lead the team to new heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland club are currently leading the second tier of Chinese football, with nine wins from 13 matches for 30 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its former head coach, Li Jinyu, resigned last month.

 Swimming star Ariarne Titmus shattered her fellow Australian Mollie O'Callaghan's world record in the women's 200 metres freestyle, clocking one minute, 52.23 seconds just weeks before the defence of her title at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Titmus hit the wall at Australia's Olympic trials in Brisbane ahead of O'Callaghan, who also went under her previous world record of 1:52.85, finishing in 1:52.48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at the results, it's unbelievable. I'm really happy to finally produce a swim in the 200 that I feel like my training reflects," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Aussie pair will provide Hong Kong's Siobhán Haughey with stiff competition in the race for 200 metres glory in Paris, with O'Callaghan also expected to duel against Haughey in the women's 100 metres freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus has been in top form in Brisbane, swimming the second-fastest 400 metres freestyle of all time on Monday as she also prepares to defend that Olympic title against the likes of Canadian Summer McIntosh and American star Katie Ledecky. (AFP)

    Ten Hag set to stay on as Man Utd manager

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ten Hag is the first United boss to win trophies in successive seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757040_1_20240612092317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag will remain in the job for next season and has entered into talks with the Old Trafford club over a contract extension despite the team's lowest ever Premier League finish of eighth, British media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision comes after an end-of-season review by the club's board for the 2023-24 campaign, which finished on a high with a shock FA Cup final win over favourites Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's contract runs until the end of next season, with the club having the option of extending it a further 12 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Ajax Amsterdam coach Ten Hag had come under increasing pressure after 20-times English champions United suffered their worst start to a season since 1962-63 with eight defeats in their first 15 matches in all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They ended up eighth after 14 defeats in their 38 league games and bowed out of the Champions League in the group phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag's job security had been the subject of speculation all season and many pundits believed the FA Cup final would be the Dutchman's last game with the team, win or lose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But moments after their thrilling triumph, the 54-year-old insisted he had no doubt he would be back and said he had received the backing of the club's owners all season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm in a project and we are exactly where we want to be. We're constructing a team. When I took over it was a mess at United, and we are on our way to construct a team for the future," he told reporters at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag pointed to United's revolving door of injuries last term, the most of any Premier League team and concentrated in key positions such as central defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also spoke about the breakout seasons of young players such as midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, who is part of England's Euro 2024 squad in Germany, and Argentina winger Alejandro Garnacho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Ten Hag's two seasons in charge, United have played in three Wembley finals and lifted two trophies, having also won last season's League Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports said that all eventualities were considered in the club's post-season review and the clear preference was for Ten Hag to remain in charge at Old Trafford. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong ended up bottom of Group E as their World Cup qualifying campaign came to a close on Tuesday with a 0-0 draw away in Turkmenistan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's side ended the competition with two points, the same as Turkmenistan, but with a weaker goal difference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile China squeezed into the third round of Asia's preliminaries for the 2026 World Cup by the narrowest of margins despite slipping to a 1-0 loss at the hands of South Korea in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia and North Korea also confirmed their progress to the next round with the national team qualifying as runners-up in Group C behind the South Koreans after Thailand could only register a 3-1 victory over Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Needing to win by three clear goals, or to score at least four with a two-goal victory margin, to climb above the Chinese in the standings, Masatada Ishii's side fell agonisingly short of a spot in the draw for the next round on June 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suphanat Mueanta put Thailand in front eight minutes before the break but Thailand-based forward Ikhsan Fandi levelled 12 minutes after the restart for the Singaporeans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A frantic Thailand pushed forward as time ticked down with Poramet Arjvirai and Jaroensak Wonggorn scoring in the last 11 minutes to take their side closer to their target, but ultimately the War Elephants fell short.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had earlier lost in Seoul World Cup Stadium when Paris St Germain winger Lee Kang-in scored from close range in the 61st minute to leave Branko Ivankovic and his players sweating on the outcome of the game in Bangkok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia, meanwhile, confirmed their progress to the third round for the first time with a comfortable 2-0 win in Group F over the Philippines at a buoyant Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan cruised to a 5-0 win over Syria in Hiroshima that fatally damaged the hopes of Hector Cuper's side, who were overtaken in second place in Group B by North Korea as a result of their 4-1 win over Myanmar in Vientiane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia, who had already confirmed their place in the next round, notched up a 5-0 win over Palestine in Perth to finish Group I with a perfect record. (RTHK/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Evan Rodrigues had two goals in the third period, Niko Mikkola and Aaron Ekblad also scored as the Florida Panthers beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-1 on Monday night to take a 2-0 lead in the Stanley Cup Final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 18 shots for Florida, which was 1-8 all-time in Cup final games before this series started — and now is two wins away from capturing its first championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the win came with a price for Florida as the Panthers lost captain Aleksander Barkov when Edmonton forward Leon Draisaitl launched toward him midway through the third period and hit him in the head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barkov remained down for some time, needed help getting to the bench and went down the tunnel for the Florida locker room for further evaluation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mattias Ekholm scored and Stuart Skinner stopped 24 shots for the Oilers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The series resumes with Game 3 in Edmonton on Thursday night. (AP)

    Real, Ancelotti backtrack over Club World Cup comments

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Carlo Ancelotti now says his comment that Real Madrid would not play in Fifa's Club World Cup had been misinterpreted. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756848_1_20240610232625.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said his comments to an Italian daily that Real Madrid would decline Fifa's invitation to participate in the Club World Cup had not been interpreted the way he intended, as the La Liga side reiterated its desire to play in the tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti had been quoted by Il Giornale in an interview on Monday as saying that Fifa had undervalued the compensation the 15-times Champions League winners should receive in the revamped tournament with 32 teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fifa can forget it, footballers and clubs will not participate in that tournament," Ancelotti was quoted as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Italian distanced himself from those comments in a social media post on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nothing could be further from my interest than to reject the possibility of playing in a tournament that I consider to be a great opportunity to continue fighting for major titles with Real Madrid," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid said their participation in the tournament was never in question.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our club will take part, as planned, in this official competition which we face with pride and with the utmost enthusiasm to once again make our millions of fans all over the world dream of a new title," they said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti, one of the most successful football managers in Europe, has won the Club World Cup three times and the Champions League five times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A single Real Madrid match is worth 20 million and Fifa wants to give us that amount for the whole cup. Negative. Like us, other clubs will refuse the invitation," he had been quoted as saying in the interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti, who led Real to a Champions League and La Liga double last season, also said there had been a lot of pressure on managers lately but he had managed to stay passionate about his job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I see nothing particularly new, this has always been our job but the case of (former Liverpool manager Juergen) Klopp is significant. The pressure continues, the burden of responsibility becomes too heavy, obsession takes over," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I keep my passion, that's how I live the match, the game, my job; I've always carried this balance with me. I've overcome moments that weren't always positive; after my experience with Everton I was off the radar, they thought I was finished, I was old."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With all three European club competitions expanded to 36 teams from next season, the Club World Cup has come under scrutiny for saturating the football calendar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, Fifa said they would not consider rescheduling their 32-team Club World Cup after global players' union FIFPRO and the World Leagues Association (WLA) threatened legal action if they did not review their plans. (Reuters)
