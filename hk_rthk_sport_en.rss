<div class="itemFullText">
 The Paris Olympics are just around the corner and authorities in France are not taking any chances on security, as the national terrorist alert remains at the highest level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police from France and dozens of other countries, alongside local security personnel, have been deployed to patrol major landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Élysées in the days leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the Olympic opening ceremony will be held outdoors, with about 300,000 spectators expected to gather along the Seine River for the spectacular show on Friday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of their arrangements, French authorities have set up security perimetres, known as “grey zones”, near the river, and tourists will need to apply for a QR code in advance for entry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The police presence around the Olympic venues and events is very strong, and implementations of the red and grey zones to block of pedestrians and vehicle traffic as they see fit. I guess they are good, even though I can’t really walk the Seine right now because I don’t have a grey pass,” American tourist Mitchell Hasenpflug told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Takehiro Kinoshita, who travelled with his family from Japan to watch the skateboarding event, said he was surprised to see how clean and prepared the city is for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel all the time safe 'cause you see all the police around the corner, and it’s amazing so I cannot complain,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not everyone's amused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local resident, Dominique, said traffic is getting worse with restricted zones and an influx of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s terrible, but we didn’t have the choice either… but no, of course you have inconvenience for these Olympic Games.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some businesses located in the sealed-off areas said they too are feeling the pinch, complaining about fewer customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some also said they are closing for a few days until after the opening ceremony on July 26.

 Polish high jumper Norbert Kobielski has been provisionally suspended for doping just days before the Paris Olympics, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old, who has a personal best of 2.33 metres, finished 10th at last year's world championships in Budapest and sixth at the European championships in Rome last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kobielski has left the Polish Olympic delegation in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AIU said he had tested positive for the banned "pentedrone norephedrine metabolite".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening ceremony for the 2024 Olympics takes place on Friday along the river Seine, although the men's high jump qualifying will not be held until August 7, with the final three days later. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British dressage star Charlotte Dujardin withdrew from the Paris Olympics on Tuesday after a video emerged allegedly showing her mistreating a horse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dujardin, a three-time Olympic champion and the joint most-decorated British woman Olympian, said she had made an "error of judgement" and expressed deep remorse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) suspended her with immediate effect, just days before the start of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governing body said it had received a video "depicting Ms Dujardin engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This video was submitted to the FEI by a lawyer representing an undisclosed complainant," the FEI added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information received, the footage was allegedly taken several years ago during a training session conducted by Ms Dujardin at a private stable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FEI said Dujardin had confirmed she was depicted in the video and had acknowledged that her conduct was "inappropriate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said she had asked to be provisionally suspended pending the outcome of the investigations and voluntarily withdrew from the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

    Sporting bodies take Fifa to EU watchdog

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Football's world governing body has been accused of taking "unilateral decisions" and of conduct that "infringes EU competition law and notably constitutes an abuse of dominance". File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762874_1_20240724014908.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two major bodies representing footballers and football clubs in Europe are filing a complaint to the European Commission accusing FIFA of abusing its position.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Football's world governing body has taken "unilateral decisions" and its conduct "infringes EU competition law and notably constitutes an abuse of dominance", FIFPro Europe and the European Leagues body said in a statement on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFPro is the global players' union while European Leagues brings together more than one thousand clubs from 33 countries around Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say FIFA's conduct with regards to the international match calendar has "harmed the economic interests of national leagues and the welfare of players" and argue FIFA's role as a regulator and competition organiser is a conflict of interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA has been accused of a failure to consult over recent changes to the calendar, such as the introduction of a 32-team Club World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first edition of the expanded Club World Cup is set to take place in the United States in June and July next year and 12 European clubs are due to feature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of the continent's leading players will therefore be obliged to participate at a time when they would otherwise have been afforded a long close-season break, a year ahead of the expanded 48-team World Cup in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The international match calendar is now beyond saturation and has become unsustainable for national leagues and a risk for the health of players," FIFPro and European Leagues said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "FIFA's decisions over the last years have repeatedly favoured its own competitions and commercial interests, neglected its responsibilities as a governing body, and harmed the economic interests of national leagues and the welfare of players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "National leagues and player unions, which represent the interests of all clubs and all players at the national level, and regulate labour relations through collectively agreed solutions, cannot accept that global regulations are decided unilaterally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Legal action is now the only responsible step for European leagues and player unions to protect football, its ecosystem and its workforce from FIFA's unilateral decisions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement refers to the Super League judgement from the European Court of Justice last December, which required FIFA and other governing bodies to exercise their regulatory functions in a way that is transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA's conduct over the calendar, they allege, "falls well short of these requirements".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain's La Liga, which is not a member of European Leagues, has also joined the complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes after England's Professional Footballers' Association and their French counterparts, the UNFP, launched an action in the Belgian courts in June to ultimately determine whether FIFA's actions had breached players' rights under European Union law. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) on Tuesday said 45 air-conditioners had been delivered to the Olympic village in Paris for SAR athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SF&OC said the move was made after coordination by the SAR government and the liaison office, as well as communication with the organising committee of the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation is one of several that that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the government announced that cultural and sports minister Kevin Yeung will fly to Paris on Thursday to attend events at the Games and cheer for Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his stay, Yeung will meet with the SAR delegation in the Olympic village and watch competitions featuring Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will return to Hong Kong on July 31.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Briton Andy Murray, the first male tennis player to claim two Olympic singles gold medals, says he will play the final event of his career at the Paris Games before heading into retirement. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762823_1_20240723172540.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world number one and three-time Grand Slam title winner Andy Murray confirmed on Tuesday that he would retire after the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Arrived in Paris for my last ever tennis tournament @Olympics. Competing for Great Britain have been by far the most memorable weeks of my career and I'm extremely proud to get do it one final time," the 37-year-old wrote on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now ranked at 121, and playing with a metal hip since 2019, Murray suffered ankle damage this year and underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his spine which ruled him out of the singles tournament at Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead, he played doubles with brother Jamie and was defeated in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray famously ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's champion at Wimbledon when he triumphed in 2013, defeating career-long rival Novak Djokovic in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added a second title in 2016, taking his career majors total to three after breaking his duck at the 2012 US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray won gold at the 2012 Olympics on an emotional day at the All England Club where he defeated Roger Federer just weeks after he had lost the Wimbledon final to the Swiss on the same Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four years later, he defeated Juan Martin del Potro to become the first player, male or female, to win two Olympic singles golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray also led Britain to the Davis Cup in 2015, the country's first in 79 years. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning Olympic silver medalist Marketa Vondrousova withdrew from the Paris Summer Games on Monday due to a hand injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2023 Wimbledon champion from the Czech Republic lost to Switerland's Belinda Bencic in the gold medal match at the Tokyo Olympics in July 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova had been planning to play singles as well as doubles with Karolina Muchova. The tennis competition at Roland Garros begins on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was hoping until the last moment that I could go at least in doubles, but problems with my hand won't let me on the court," Vondrousova posted on Instagram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kateřina Siniaková, who won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in doubles and is a nine-time Grand Slam champion in women's doubles, will replace Vondrousova in the women's singles tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova, 25, said her focus now shifts to getting healthy in time for next month's U.S. Open, the final grand slam on the 2024 calendar. (Reuters)

 Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar has been ruled out of the Paris 2024 Olympics, the Slovenian Olympic Committee said on Monday.

  Pogacar, who won his third Tour on Sunday, was not selected because of fatigue, the Slovenian Olympic Committee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar was due to take part in the road race on August 3.

  "Unfortunately Tadej Pogacar has cancelled his participation because of a state of extreme fatigue," Slovenian Olympic cycling coach Uros Murn said in a statement.

  The SAR Athletes will join thousands of other competitors in a unique ceremony taking place on the River Seine in Paris, and winding past some of the most famous landmarks in the French capital on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of their departure to Paris, the Chef de Mission of the SAR delegation, Brian Stevenson, called on Hongkongers to back the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look to the athletes to perform their best, and of course the best for each athlete differs, but I'm talking about their personal best. If they can achieve that, you cannot ask for more than that, other than that bit better than even their best," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll be satisfied if all the athletes have given their very best performance and we know their records and what they can achieve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who was the city's flag bearer at the Tokyo Olympics, becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to be picked for the honour in successive Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stevenson also confirmed air-conditioners will arrive at the Olympic village on Tuesday, admitting the units were arriving later than scheduled because of security reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is one of a number of delegations that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.

 LeBron James, the NBA's all-time leading points scorer, will be the male flagbearer for Team USA at the Paris Olympics, US Olympic officials announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  James, 39, was picked by his fellow US Olympians for Friday's ceremony on the River Seine. The female flagbearer will be announced on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an incredible honour to represent the United States on this global stage, especially in a moment that can bring the whole world together," Los Angeles Lakers power forward James said in a statement from the USOPC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sports have the power to bring us all together, and I'm proud to be a part of this important moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony on the Seine will be the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James, an Olympic gold medallist in 2008 and 2012, is not the only NBA star set to bear the flag for his country in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player and league champion in 2021, will perform the role for Greece. (AFP)

 Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth will be the first Hong Kong sailors racing in Olympic 49er competitions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 49er is a two-handed skiff-type high-performance sailing dinghy, which requires the two crew members to work on different roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo told RTHK about their strong bond, which started in 2018 when they paired up.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Arthur Fils came out on top after a gruelling three-set encounter with Alexander Zverev to win the Hamburg Open on Sunday, defeating the hometown player 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/1).
 <br>
  <br/>
  After victory in Lyon last year, it is the 20-year-old's second ATP title as he confirms his position as one of the sport's leading next-gen players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 28 Fils overcame German top seed Zverev on the clay in Hamburg after just over three-and-a-half hours on court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew from the start it was not going to be easy. First set I was taking care of it, I think I had a little but of luck, but playing great. Then second set he managed to play better than me and to raise his level," said Fils during the trophy ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we closed the roof I knew it was going to be just a fight, like a dogfight. You just have to fight until the last point, until the last ball. I've practising for a long time for this kind of moment so I'm really happy to win it." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Xander Schauffele said a "sense of calm" helped him win the British Open on Sunday as the American claimed his second major just two months after triumphing at the PGA Championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old Californian delivered a faultless, zen-like six-under-par final round at Royal Troon to emerge from a congested leaderboard and clinch the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele finished on nine-under par for the championship, two shots ahead of England's Justin Rose and Billy Horschel of the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schauffele, who registered a major record of 21-under-par to win the PGA at Valhalla in May, is the first player to win two majors in a year since Brooks Koepka in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His victory on the west coast of Scotland completes an American clean sweep of the game's biggest titles in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought (winning the PGA) would help me and it actually did. I had this sense of calm, a calm I didn't have when I played earlier at the PGA," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was telling my caddie Austin (Kaiser) that I felt pretty calm coming down the stretch and he said he was about to puke on the 18th tee."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just told myself to just hit it down there and keep moving along," added the world number three, who described clinching the Open as a "dream come true". (AFP)

    Team orders hand Piastri maiden F1 victory in Hungary

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri said he realised a childhood dream on Sunday after claiming his maiden Formula One victory in a whirlpool of mixed emotions and vexed team orders as McLaren claimed an emphatic one-two at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After taking the lead at the start, when he passed pole-sitting team-mate Lando Norris, the 23-year-old Australian pulled clear to control the race until losing out in the pit-stops, when the Briton gained an advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McLaren pitted him first for an 'undercut' to fend off seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes who finished third after surviving a skirmish with Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This resulted in Norris, who had superior pace, inheriting the lead, leading into the closing laps and receiving repeated orders to give back his position – and victory – to Piastri, who was struggling to close the gap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After prolonged strained dialogue on the team radio, Norris agreed to slow down and let Piastri pass him with three laps remaining, despite knowing he was losing a chance to cut substantially into Max Verstappen's lead in the drivers' championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A very special day for me," said Piastri. "This is the day I've dreamed of as a kid, to be standing on the top step of an F1 podium. A bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he was unfazed by the team orders arguments played out over the closing laps as McLaren asked Norris to slow down, preserve his tyres and allow Piastri to catch and pass him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer you leave it, of course, you get a bit nervous, but it was well-executed by the team and it was the right thing to do. I had put myself in the right position at the start," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the different strategies we had, my pace probably wasn't as quick as I would have liked in the last stint, but I was still in the right position to make it happen." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafa Nadal gets a hug from Nuno Borges after his defeat in the Bastad Open final. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762566_1_20240721222405.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal lost his first final in two years on Sunday as the Spaniard went down 6-3, 6-2 to Portugal's Nuno Borges at the clay-court Bastad Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish tennis great had shown signs of a return to form in Scandinavia as he made an impressive run to the final, just one week before tennis at the Olympic Games gets under way on the clay in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nadal, rather than celebrating his 64th title on the surface and first since Roland Garros 2022, was dominated by Borges as he struggled to find fluency with his serve and ground strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know what to say. I think I was wishing for this moment for a while already," said Borges in his post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's crazy, in tennis it doesn't happen when you expect it sometimes. I know we all wanted Rafa to win, a part of me wished that too, but something even bigger inside of me really pushed through today... I'm just really happy overall. I really don't know what to say, I'm very emotional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borges was the first to make headway in the match when he broke the Spaniard's serve to go 3-1 up, with Nadal saving break points before overcooking a forehand down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the 14-time French Open winner struck back immediately on the Borges serve, earning two break-back points before the Portuguese dumped a forehand into the net from inside the service box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But neither player could quite grab the ascendancy in the first set as Borges quickly ran up a 0-40 lead in the next service game, converting his second break point with a perfectly executed drop shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal was struggling to find his first serve but managed to hold just his second service game of the opening set to force Borges to serve one more time. The world number 51 kept his nerve to do just that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old showed signs of his old self serving at deuce in the first game of the second set with a booming forehand winner down the line, before he eventually held but that was one of the few highlights for Nadal on the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Borges then struck at 2-2 as he broke Nadal's serve for the first time in the second set and fourth time overall to edge ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old followed it up by winning the next three games, sealing a maiden career title in his first-ever match-up against the former world number one with an ace. (AFP)

    Guidelines not meant to find faults: sports bosses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New guidelines on the corporate governance of sports associations are expected to be unveiled in mid-September, Hong Kong's sports bosses said on Sunday, stressing they were not trying to pinpoint any shortcomings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China has been conducting a review of the corporate governance of national sports associations in the SAR following an audit report in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary-general of the federation, said the sports governing body had submitted a plan to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not about fault-finding, picking out what is wrong. We always look at our national sports associations as our affiliates. They need our support, and what is right should stay, what is wrong should be changed. We need to keep up with the times. Times have changed and what's appropriate in the past may not be nowadays," Yang told a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[By doing so,] we hope the selection of athletes can meet our current requirements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Kenneth Fok said it's important for the sports governing body to conduct a "health check".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he urged people not to question the governance of the entire sports sector based on isolated incidents, saying that a majority of associations and organisations under the governing body had been able to promote sports development professionally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the upcoming Paris Olympics, Fok, who is also the federation's vice-president, said he believed there would not be blunders involving the national anthem at the Games as there were procedures in place to ensure the correct song was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe there will not be any mistakes at the Olympics, because it is the most sought-after event around the world. The organising committee would arrange for us to verify the national anthem and flags, and the whole process would require signatures," Fok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have to tell our athletes that some audience members are very enthusiastic and they will bring regional and national flags to the venues. But sometimes, they may have the wrong versions. So we have urged athletes not to take the flags given to them, because it would become their responsibility once they take the flags."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending 35 athletes to Paris, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fok called on the public to support them regardless of whether they win a medal or not, saying he was confident in the athletes' performance at the Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Billy Horschel leads the British Open at four under par heading into Sunday's final round after torrential rain and a swirling wind at Royal Troon blew the challenge for the Claret Jug wide open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Horschel leads by one from a group of six, featuring USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, South Africa's Thriston Lawrence and Americans Sam Burns and Russell Henley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler is just one shot further back at two under after battling to an even par round of 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 12 players are within four shots of the lead for what promises to be a fascinating final round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight leader Shane Lowry had a day to forget as the 2019 champion crumbled in the sodden conditions to collapse from eight under par after seven holes to one under by the end of his round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Horschel was one of the big movers in a round that had allowed for lower scoring earlier in the day before the wind and rain picked up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting at two under, Horschel produced a sublime four-under 32 on the front nine thanks to birdies at four, six, seven and nine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bogey followed at 11 before another dropped shot at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown, ranked 272 in the world, had been set to lead heading into the final round until a double bogey at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he and Rose remain in the hunt to become the first English winner since Nick Faldo in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry began the day with a two-shot lead and extended that to three with a birdie at the par-five fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Irishman's round began to come off the rails with a double bogey at the 130-yard Postage Stamp eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worse was to come as five bogeys in eight holes on the back nine dropped Lowry back into ninth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fresh from his maiden major win at the USPGA, Schauffele is eyeing another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three moved to five under at one stage before bogeys at 11 and 18 knocked him back to three under after a round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll let myself dream tonight," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler is also right in the mix to win his third major and win for a seventh time in 15 starts this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A birdie at the third got the American off to a fine start but he then played the next 13 holes in two over before picking up a shot at the 17th to remain ominously poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The back nine, I think that was probably the hardest nine holes that I'll ever play," said Scheffler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence, Burns and Henley made the most of the benign early morning conditions to shoot through the pack to three under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence and Burns posted six-under 65s, while Henley made 66 to move into contention before the leaders had to face the worst of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time major champion Justin Thomas and former Masters winner Adam Scott also impressed to move to level par and remain on the fringes of the battle for the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the challenge from the big names on the breakaway Liv circuit failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jon Rahm slipped back to two over, while Brooks Koepka is back at eight over after a 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the loudest cheers of the week so far was reserved for Kim Si-woo after he produced the longest hole-in-one in British Open history on the 17th that brought him back to five over for the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was not doing very well, and then I was feeling terrible for my shots the last couple days. Then finally I got the best golf shot I've ever had this week," said the South Korean. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal reached his first final since winning the 2022 French Open, defeating Croatian qualifier Duje Ajdukovic in a three-set tussle in Bastad on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A day after his four-hour quarter-final victory, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was again tested to the limit by Ajdukovic, the world number 130 who had won just two tour-level matches before this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard rebounded from dropping the opening set to prevail 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, returning to the final of a tournament he won as a teenager in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will play Portuguese seventh seed Nuno Borges or Argentina's Thiago Agustin Tirante on Sunday as he goes in search of the 93rd singles title of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most recent triumph came two years ago at Roland Garros, when he won the tournament for a record-extending 14th time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal is using the event in Bastad as a tune-up for the Paris Olympics, where the tennis will be played on the clay at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old returned to action this week for the first time since losing in the first round of the French Open in late May. (AFP)

    Pogacar wins fifth stage on Tour as victory nears

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tadej Pogacar celebrates after winning stage 20 of the 2024 Tour de France. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762491_1_20240721013834.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall leader Tadej Pogacar won for a fifth time on this Tour de France on Saturday, moving to the brink of a third title, as defending champion Jonas Vingegaard came second and Remco Evenepoel dropped around a minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just Sunday's concluding time trial to come, two-time champion Pogacar has a five minute 14-second lead over Vingegaard as he effectively made sure of becoming the first man in 26 years to capture the Giro d'Italia-Tour de France double in the same season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day's action culminated on the tough Col de Couillole climb where Evenepoel attacked Vingegaard in an attempt to take second place overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead he himself dropped around 53sec on the Dane, making it less likely the Belgian can claim second place after Sunday's time trial, where he is favourite for the stage win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel did however virtually guarantee third place overall and the white jersey as best young rider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic champion Richard Carapaz, regarded as the most combative rider on the 2024 Tour, will win the climb points jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carapaz came third on Saturday, won a stage and even took the yellow jersey for a day early in the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 3,498km on this 2024 Tour there remains just 34, a challenging run along the narrow, undulating corniche between the principality of Monaco, where many in the peloton live, and the French Riviera town of Nice. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris claimed pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday ahead of Oscar Piastri as McLaren celebrated their first front row lock-out in over a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen took third in qualifying to start Sunday's race on the second row with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz for company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's under pressure teammate Sergio Perez crashed out in the first session, triggering a red flag and increasing pressure on his job as the Dutch driver's number two at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Ricciardo, a former winner at the circuit, produced a late flash of speed once Q1 resumed to top the times in his RB from Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes with the seven-time champion's teammate George Russell the big name absentee from Q2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris led the pack into the top-10 shoot out, with Hamilton, who broke his lengthy winless run at Silverstone last time out, sneaking through with the slowest time of the middle leg of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuki Tsunoda ended up in a wall in his RB, forcing a second red flag with just two minutes left and Norris and Piastri provisionally locking out the front row for McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen had to sit out the conclusion of qualifying when it resumed after Tsunoda's stricken RB was removed due to an issue with his car as McLaren sealed the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton is on the third row after the fifth fastest time ahead of Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari, Aston Martin duo Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll, with Ricciardo and Tsunoda completing the top 10.
  <br/>

  Verstappen leads Norris by 84 points going into Sunday's race at the Hungaroring. (AFP)

    Former world snooker champion Reardon dies aged 91

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ray Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762471_1_20240720202754.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world champion Ray Reardon, the coal miner who dominated snooker in the 1970s, has died at the age of 91.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Welshman Reardon had previously been diagnosed with cancer and passed away on Friday night, his wife Carol confirmed on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ray Reardon, widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever and a six-time world champion, has died at the age of 91," a World Snooker Tour statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jimmy White, one of snooker's most popular players, said on X: "Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978, earning an MBE in the 1985 Queen's Birthday honours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed 'Dracula' after playing a session of the 1974 World Championship final in a cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket, Reardon rose to prominence as snooker became a popular sport in Britain thanks to the Pot Black television programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most," Reardon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He battled the flamboyant Alex Higgins in a long-running rivalry with the "Hurricane" that included an epic 18-15 defeat in the 1982 World Championship final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former world number one worked as a coal miner and was also a police officer for eight years before taking snooker by storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was fortunate to survive a mining accident when a 12-foot girder and a deluge of rubble crashed down on him while he was building a pit lane, leaving him trapped for three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right," he wrote in his autobiography.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon retired in 1991 at the age of 58 but remained in the snooker world, helping Ronnie O'Sullivan as a consultant during his run to the 2004 world title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Welsh Open trophy was named in Reardon's honour in 2016. (AFP)

    Lowry takes Open lead as McIlroy, Woods miss cut

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Irishman Shane Lowry heads into the weekend at Troon two shots ahead. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762385_1_20240720052225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday, as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among the star names to miss the cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Only 10 of the 154 players left in the field are under par as the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast wreaked havoc, with five of the world's top 10 failing to make the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry leads by two from Justin Rose, who came through qualifying to book his place in Troon, and unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown on his major debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here," said Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also well in the running at one under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy's decade-long wait for a major will extend into 2025 at least after a disastrous two days to finish on 11 over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two needed an under par round after shooting 78 on Thursday but carded a triple bogey eight at the fourth in a run of six dropped shots in four holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That four-hole stretch to start off is what cost me," said the Northern Irishman. "Twenty-two holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods was one of the few players to finish below McIlroy on 14 over after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time British Open champion's score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and was his poorest at this event by three shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg, Wyndham Clark and Viktor Hovland were the other top-10 players to miss the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were joined by 2022 champion Cam Smith, Tommy Fleetwood and Sahith Theegala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre bounced back from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to sneak into the weekend at five over. (AFP)

 Teenage gymnast Shoko Miyata has been pulled from Japan's team for the Paris Olympics after being caught smoking and drinking, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old, a world bronze medallist and captain of Japan's women's gymnastics team for the Games, was sent home from their training camp in Monaco after admitting she had violated their code of conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With her confirmation and after discussions on all sides, it has been decided that she will withdraw from the Olympics," Japan Gymnastics Association (JGA) secretary general Kenji Nishimura told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said the association had been told that Miyata was seen smoking in a private setting in Tokyo some time at the end of June or beginning of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also reportedly drank alcohol in a room at Japan's national training centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoking and drinking are both illegal under the age of 20 in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said it was not clear whether Miyata was at a party or drinking alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being a member of the Japan national gymnastics team is a position where you have high demands on you all the time," said JGA chairman Tadashi Fujita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fujita said that Miyata was already back in Japan after leaving the team's camp and that the JGA would give her support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miyata won bronze in the balance beam at the 2022 world championships in Liverpool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the all-around title at Japan's national championships earlier this year. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tadej Pogacar climbed to a convincing victory on stage 19 of the Tour de France on Friday, extending his overall lead over defending champion Jonas Vingegaard to close on a historic Tour-Giro double.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With two tough stages remaining, the 2020 and 2021 Tour de France champion Pogacar leads Vingegaard by 5min 3sec while Remco Evenepoel remains third, now at 7min 1sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar is also two stages away from a Giro d'Italia and Tour de France double, which would be a first since 1998.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A dominant and confident Pogacar promised to attack here on the 'Queen' stage with its massive mountains and came into stage 19 with a 3min 11sec lead over Vingegaard, with Evenepoel at 5min 11sec in third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous weak moments for the Team UAE rider have come at altitude and in hot weather, as he let slip the last two Tour de France titles to the Dane Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So the 25-year-old will have been happy riding under overcast skies as the mercury dipped to 18.5 Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was plenty of altitude on the menu however as the pack first crossed the fan-packed Col de la Bonette, a 23km climb at 7 percent average gradient to the dizzying altitude of 2,800m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final climb to Isola 2000 ski resort is hardly less crushing and Pogacar attacked with a jaw-dropping 10km to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left his rivals trailing in his wake and chewed up the attackers one by one in quick succession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matteo Jorgenson was second on the day at 21sec, while Simon Yates had led much of the way but dropped to third at 40sec after Pogacar passed him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Carapaz was fourth at 1min 11sec and Evenepoel fifth with Vingegaard on his wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eritrean break-out star Biniam Girmay retained the green sprint jersey ahead of Jasper Philipsen as the escape group took the intermediate sprint points way ahead of the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay and Philipsen have both won three stages on this year's race, while Pogacar has four. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal continued his Olympic preparations with a confident 6-4, 6-4 win over Cameron Norrie at the Bastad Open on Thursday, showing signs of the power hitting that fired him to 14 French Open titles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old Spaniard continued his return to winning ways on the Swedish clay as he moved into the quarter-finals, racking up his ninth Tour win of the year and back-to-back wins for the first time since reaching the last-16 of the Madrid Open in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Great feelings now, I've been a while now without playing on the Tour since Roland Garros and had the chance to compete well against a great player like Cameron," said Nadal during his on-court interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I played, for moments, good tennis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal now leads the former world number eight Briton 5-1 in their head-to-head record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam champion was unstoppable as he ground his opponent down with powerful, topspin-heavy ground strokes. He broke Norrie again and served out to love, having won five games in a row to take the match in straight sets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian Victor Campenaerts wept with joy after winning stage 18 of the Tour de France as overall leader Tadej Pogacar and defending champion Jonas Vingegaard saved their thunder for a trilogy of harsh stages over the final weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pogacar and Vingegaard were relaxed as the escape pulled 15 minutes clear, the pair content to hold fire as the 2024 Tour reaches its climax in Nice on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow and Saturday," Pogacar said at the line, shaking his head as if the names of the day's themselves explained the massive challenge ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we enjoyed today with the team, what a wonderful journey," said the 2020 and 2021 champion who came second on the last two Tours to Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Slovenian is three days away from a cycling landmark as he won the Giro d'Italia in May and will become the first rider in 25-years to complete the double if he holds on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar retained a 3min 11sec lead on Vingegaard as the peloton rolled gently over the finish line 13min 41sec after the winner, while rookie Remco Evenepoel is third at 5min 09sec. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marseille have signed striker Mason Greenwood from Manchester United, the Ligue 1 side announced on Thursday, despite the objection of some of the French club's fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old, who has played once for England, was suspended in January 2022 by Manchester United following allegations of attempted rape and sexual assault but prosecutors dropped charges in February 2023. He spent last season on loan at Getafe in La Liga.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Olympique de Marseille are delighted to announce the signing of Mason Greenwood from Manchester United. The 22-year-old striker has signed for the club following a successful medical," said the French club on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marseille made no mention of the allegations in their statement. They called Greenwood "a precocious talent" and an "English nugget".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The southern club, eighth in Ligue 1 last season, said their new striker will wear the number 10 shirt but did not specify the length of his contract or mention any fee to Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the deal is reported to be worth an estimated 30 million euros (US$32.7 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We wish Mason all the best in his future career," said United on their website. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Vieira stood down as manager of Strasbourg, the Ligue 1 club confirmed on Thursday, as his name was linked to the vacant United States men's team coaching job.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vieira, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, joined Strasbourg last season and is leaving "by mutual agreement," the French club said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, 48, coached New York City in the MLS between 2016-2018 and, according to widespread reports, could be returning to the US to succeed Gregg Berhalter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berhalter was axed as United States coach following their first-round exit in the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira was asked about the States job last week after Strasbourg lost 4-0 to Turkish giants Fernebahce in a pre-season friendly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States? Ah no, my focus is 100% in Alsace (Strasbourg)" he told a local newspaper in the north eastern region of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, who was under contract with Strasbourg until 2026, ended last season with his club in 13th place in Ligue 1. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Justin Thomas made a strong start at the 152nd Open but then hit trouble as rain squalls kept a grip on the early scoring at Royal Troon in Scotland on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Alex Noren was the early clubhouse leader with a birdie on the 18th giving him a two-under-par 69, but Thomas initially looked like eclipsing that mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former PGA Championship winner gathered four birdies with one bogey on his outward nine and then birdied the 10th to top the early leader board on four under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a double-bogey six at the 12th and a bogey on the 13th dropped him back into the pack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow American Bryson DeChambeau, last month's US Open champion, started in the company of young Swede Ludvig Aberg, who is ranked fourth in the world, but the big-hitting DeChambeau suffered a terrible start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was five over after his first six holes and in danger of playing himself out of contention on day one. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into racist chants by Argentina players after they won the Copa America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "FIFA is aware of a video circulating on social media and the incident is being looked into," a spokesperson for world football's governing body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added: "FIFA strongly condemns any form of discrimination by anyone including players, fans and officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chants were heard during a live video posted on social media by Chelsea and Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez from the team bus in the wake of the Copa victory over Colombia in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some players, including 23-year-old Fernandez, sing a chant dating back to the 2022 World Cup final in which Argentina beat France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The song targets France's star striker Kylian Mbappe among others and includes racist and homophobic insults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea had earlier announced they had launched an internal disciplinary procedure against Fernandez over the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez has apologised and the club said in a statement it had launched an "internal disciplinary procedure".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chelsea Football Club finds all forms of discriminatory behaviour completely unacceptable," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We acknowledge and appreciate our player's public apology and will use this as an opportunity to educate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fernandez, who joined Chelsea from Portugese club Benfica in 2023, said in his apology: "The song includes highly offensive language and there is absolutely no excuse for these words.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I stand against discrimination in all forms and apologise for getting caught up in the euphoria of our Copa America celebrations." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal and Casper Ruud saved a match point in the deciding set tie-break to reach the semi-finals of the doubles in Bastad on Wednesday, hours after the Norwegian was knocked out of the singles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nadal and Ruud squeezed past France's Theo Arribage and Roman Safiullin of Russia 6-4, 3-6, 12-10 to advance to the last four, winning the final three points of the match after being on the brink of defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we had some fun. It was an emotional match at the end, a good level of tennis against two good players," said Nadal, who is also competing in the singles tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We enjoy it, the crowd was amazing. Full crowd in a doubles match, that's fantastic. Just enjoying every single day here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Nadal and Ruud wait to discover their semi-final opponents, the Spaniard will be back in action on Thursday against Britain's Cameron Norrie in the round of 16 in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam champion returned to competition for the first time this week since his early French Open exit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will hope to avoid the same fate as Ruud, whose Olympic preparations took a hit when he lost 6-3, 6-3 to Thiago Monteiro in the second round earlier on Wednesday. (AFP)

 Ecuador's Richard Carapaz won stage 17 of the Tour de France after the remnants of a breakaway finished ahead of the main pretenders in the High Alps on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  EF rider Carapaz dropped Simon Yates and soloed the final 10km to win his first ever Tour de France stage after finishing third overall in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Giro d'Italia champion, who won the Tokyo Olympics road race, also wore the overall leader's yellow jersey after his efforts in the second stage to Bologna.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall leader Tadej Pogacar, defending champion Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel kept their powder dry until late in the medium mountain run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio then produced an entertaining scrap with third-placed Evenepoel finishing 12sec ahead of Pogacar, with Vingegaard losing two seconds to the leader. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rory McIlroy bumps fists with a fan after a practice round ahead of the 152nd British Open Golf Championship at Royal Troon. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762031_1_20240718004735.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers has said he "doesn't care" that the British Open's prize fund is not among the top 25 in men's golf.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Royal & Ancient Golf Club announced minimal increases to prize money for the 152nd British Open this week amid "concern" about the impact on financial sustainability and the perception of men's golf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winner at Royal Troon on Sunday will receive £2.38 million (US$3.1 million), which is an increase of just US$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bryson DeChambeau earned US$4.3 million for winning last month's US Open, while Scottie Scheffler's Masters victory in April came with a US$3.6 million prize.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total British Open prize fund of US$17 million is up by just US$500,000 on last year and stands as less than the other three majors, 12 PGA Tour events and all 14 Liv Golf events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A, I didn't know, and B, I don't care," said Slumbers, who is set to step down from his role in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we will always offer a very competitive prize fund for the Open, our wider focus is on increasing participation and improving pathways in golf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to make choices about how we allocate resources and make the resources we have go as far as they can. Our responsibility is to ensure the game is thriving 50 years from now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not worried about being a lone voice. Sometimes leadership is lonely."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 158 players, rather than the usual 156, will contest this year's British Open after more past champions than expected opted to play at Royal Troon, with 18 players from Liv Golf in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But while USGA chief executive Mike Whan said last month he is serious about creating a formal pathway for Liv players into the US Open, Slumbers suggested that was not necessary for the British Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We decided after last year's event that we wanted to ensure that there was sufficient enough opportunities for all players, whichever tour they're playing on, to get into the Open," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used our Open Qualifying Series. We picked events that were available for all players. We used the Asian Tour and we used final qualifying to create those opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will that evolve in the coming years? I think that depends on how the game evolves. But we will continue to want the best players in the world to be able to get into the Open in an appropriate way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for future venues, Slumbers said that the Open was "absolutely" going to return to Muirfield for the first time since 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The possibility of staging the Open outside the UK for the first time also remains on the agenda, with Portmarnock having asked the Irish government for support in putting forward a case to stage the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are fully supportive of the club doing that and we are actively engaged in making those assessments," Slumbers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But no decisions have been made because we don't even know if it's possible." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boston's Jarren Duran, the All-Star MVP, hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the fifth inning as the American League beat the National League 5-3 on Tuesday night for its 10th win in the past 11 All-Star Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes pitched a hitless first for the NL, twice hitting 100mph, and Shohei Ohtani hit a three-run homer in the third for a 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Juan Soto hit a two-run double and scored on David Fry's single to tie the score in the third, and Duran went deep off Cincinnati's Hunter Greene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duran is the fifth Boston player to be an All-Star MVP, the first since J.D. Drew in 2008. The others were Pedro Martinez in 1999, Roger Clemens in 1986 and Carl Yastrzemski in 1970. (AP)

    Nadal triumphs in first singles match since May

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nadal celebrates after his victory against Sweden's Leo Borg. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761891_1_20240717084121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal swept past Leo Borg, son of tennis great Bjorn Borg, to advance to the second round of the Bastad Open on Tuesday as he builds towards the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was Nadal's first singles match since the 38-year-old fell in the opening round at Roland Garros on May 27, and he eased to a 6-3, 6-4 win in wet conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Nadal and the 21-year-old Borg, currently ranked 461st in the world, were wild card entries to the Swedish clay-court tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an early scare with the former world number one slipping on the wet white line, Nadal broke for 3-1, hitting four aces to take the first set in 43 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An immediate break gave the Spaniard a foothold in the second, sealing the match on his second match point after 1hr 25min on court for his eighth ATP tour match win this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's good, I'm finally defending my title," joked Nadal, who has not played in Bastad since winning the title aged 19 in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't been playing a lot of tennis in the last few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even in the tougher moments, I have been able to keep going with the help of the team, but of course the fans have a huge impact on that. They give me amazing energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam winner praised his rival, the son of the long-retired former world number one Bjorn Borg, now 68.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a huge honour to play against the son of one of the biggest legends in the history of our sport," said Nadal. "I think he played quite well, he has a great future in front. I wish him all the very best." (AFP)

    Real Madrid officially unveil Kylian Mbappé

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé finally put on a Real Madrid jersey on Tuesday, fulfilling his childhood dream in front of a packed Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 80,000 fans were in hand at the Bernabeu to welcome the 25-year-old France star during his official presentation as the club's newest player.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After signing his five-year contract with the Spanish powerhouse alongside club president Florentino Pérez, Mbappé entered the stage set up at the Bernabeu to loud cheers by the Madrid fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wearing the No. 9 jersey, Mbappé smiled broadly and waved to the fans who chanted his name, then embraced Pérez and former Madrid player and coach Zinedine Zidane, who invited Mbappé to visit the Spanish club for the first time when he was just a teenager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's an incredible day for me," Mbappé told the crowd, in good Spanish. ”Since being a kid I dreamed about playing for Madrid and today I'm here. It means a lot to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé finished his speech by asking the crowd to join him and chant “Hala Madrid,” similar to what his childhood idol – and “now friend” – Cristiano Ronaldo did when he arrived at the club. Mbappé then kissed the club’s shield and went around the Bernabeu kicking balls to the crowd in the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now I have another dream, which is to live up to the history of this club, the best club in the world,” he said. “I’ll give my life to this club and to this shield.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record 15 European Cups won by Madrid were on display on the stage where Mbappé was introduced. His relatives, club officials and several former players were also by the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I see my family happy, I see my mother crying,” said Mbappé, who earlier Tuesday underwent his physical with Madrid's doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The message “Welcome, Mbappé” was shown on the large video boards at the newly revamped Bernabeu, which had its roof closed for the midday ceremony in the Spanish capital. (AP)

    Gareth Southgate resigns as England manager

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After eight years, four major tournaments and two finals, Gareth Southgate announced he was stepping down as England manager on Tuesday, saying it was “time for change.”
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunday’s 2-1 loss to Spain in the European Championship final proved to be his last game in charge of the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As a proud Englishman, it has been the honor of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all,” he said. “But it’s time for change, and for a new chapter.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southgate’s contract was due to expire this year and his announcement comes after months of uncertainty surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mikel Oyarzabal’s 86th-minute winner in Berlin was a painful way to end his reign after he transformed the fortunes of England’s underperforming national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hired in 2016, he led England to back-to-back finals at the Euros and to the semifinals of the World Cup in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, ultimately, he was unable to end the nation’s decades-long wait for a first major trophy since the World Cup in 1966. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's Thomas Müller has called time on his 14-year international career after their European Championship exit, the Bayern Munich forward said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old featured in his eighth and last tournament on July 5, in Germany's 2-1 quarter-final defeat by Spain, where he was brought on as a substitute in the 80th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Müller helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup and has the third most appearances for the national team with 131 caps and 45 goals. He also won the Golden Boot and Young Player Award during the 2010 World Cup, when Germany finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It always made me very proud to play for my country. We celebrated together and sometimes shed a tear together," Müller said in a farewell video on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I had the privilege of making my first international appearance, I would never have dreamed of all this. I would like to say thank you to all the fans and my Germany teammates for their support over the years. Take the enthusiasm and joy of this year's Euros with you." (Reuters)

    Copa chaos raises concerns for 2026 World Cup

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans rush the gates before the Copa America final at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, Florida. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761747_1_20240716082151.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chaotic scenes at the Copa America final have raised serious questions for the organisers of the 2026 World Cup which will be held in North America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The start of Sunday's final between Colombia and Argentina at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium was delayed by 82 minutes as overwhelmed security struggled to process the safe entry fans into the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers blamed ticketless fans for rushing the entry points into the venue for their decision to keep the gates closed for almost three hours after the planned opening time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, while there was plenty of evidence of ticketless fans entering, it was also clear that the security system was unable to cope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some fans needed medical attention for heat exhaustion after being stuck in the crush around the fencing at the entrance to the 65,000 capacity venue amid alarming scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hard Rock Stadium will host seven games at the 2026 World Cup which the USA is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Copa America was organised by South American confederation CONMEBOL while the World Cup will be controlled by global governing body FIFA and it's local organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not a good look," said former USA international Alexi Lalas, now a leading television pundit for Fox Sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand this is not a good look for CONMEBOL and this is also, because it is happening on our watch, in our country, not a good look for the US less than two years out from the World Cup," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA, who had no role in the running of the Copa, did not immediately comment on the incidents but sources indicated they would now intensify discussions with stadiums over their security plans. (AFP)

 Thousands of people in Madrid welcomed Spain's squad home on Monday after they beat England to win Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After receptions with King Felipe VI and prime minister Pedro Sanchez, La Roja were paraded through the capital city on an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was adorned with the message "it's only the beginning" and the trophy sat at the front of the bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want a lot," Sanchez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want more," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The likes of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Sunday's match-winner in Berlin, Mikel Oyarzabal, wore white t-shirts with the number four on them in reference to the record number of times Spain have won the European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For now, we're not realising yet what we have accomplished," Williams said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacker, who scored the opening goal of the 2-1 victory, was also eager to thank Spain's fans "for the love and warmth they brought the team".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team bus took them to Plaza Cibeles in central Madrid where thousands more fans waited to celebrate the success, following on from victories in 1964, 2008 and 2012. (AFP)

 A goal in the depths of extra time gave handed a record 16th Copa America title to Argentina who prevailed over Colombia in a closely-fought final in Miami.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun is looking to take part in his second Olympics next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clinched gold in men's single sculls in the lightweight category of the World Rowing Cup in May, which involved athletes weighing no more than 72.5 kilogrammes. Now, he's taking on a whole new challenge by participating in the open category in the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu told RTHK he's adopting a new strategy that he believes will better prepare him against the "real giants".

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761496_1_20240714044529.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina captain Lionel Messi hopes forward Angel Di Maria ends his international career with a goal in Sunday's Copa America final against Colombia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Di Maria, 36, announced in November his plans to retire from internationals after representing his country for 15 years and Messi wants him to get his name on the scoresheet as he did against Brazil to clinch the continental title in 2021 and against France as they won the 2022 World Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe he'll score another goal in the final like he did in all the previous ones he's played in. It would be extraordinary," Messi said in an interview with Direct TV Sports, adding that the team still hopes he will reverse his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always tell him that if everything goes well, we have playoff games coming up. Nevertheless, 'Fideo' (Di Maria) has made up his mind and there's nothing that can change it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Di Maria has scored 31 goals in 144 appearances for Argentina, having played in six Copa Americas and four World Cups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also struck the winner in Argentina's 1-0 victory over Nigeria to win Olympic gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. (Reuters)

    Alcaraz dominates Djokovic to retain Wimbledon crown

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz overpowered seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets to retain his Wimbledon title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish third seed produced a performance combining awesome power with delicate touch to win 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/4), collecting the fourth Grand Slam of his young career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz equals the Open Era record for most Grand Slams won at the age 21 or under, joining Boris Becker, Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he is just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, who had knee surgery just weeks ago, was aiming to win a 25th Grand Slam - which would have been a record in the men's and women's game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he had no answers in the Centre Court sunshine as the electric Alcaraz pounded him from the back of the court and treated the crowd to an array of his trademark drop shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly, it is a dream for me winning this trophy," said the Spaniard. "I did an interview when I was 11 and I said my dream is to win Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me this is the most beautiful tournament, the most beautiful court and the most beautiful trophy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz paid tribute to his beaten opponent, who only found his range in the third set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Djokovic is an unbelievable fighter, I knew he was going to have his chances," said Alcaraz who had needed five sets to defeat the Serb in the 2023 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was difficult but I tried to stay calm going into the tie-break and tried to play my best tennis. I was glad at the end I could find the solutions."(AFP)

    Last-gasp drop goal lifts Ireland over Springboks

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland toppled rugby world champions South Africa 25-24 with a drop goal by Ciaran Frawley in the last second of a ferocious body-smashing contest at Kings Park on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Irish rebounded from losing 27-20 last weekend in Pretoria by notching only their second ever win over the Springboks in South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It didn't look like it would happen after the Springboks came back from 16-6 down at halftime, finding another gear and forcing errors that Handre Pollard used to kick eight penalties from eight attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after falling behind 24-19 with 15 minutes to go, Ireland found the energy to pin South Africa in their 22. They waived off a penalty kick to go for a try and squandered a tapped penalty. But, out of nowhere, replacement flyhalf Frawley lined up a 42-metre drop goal in the 70th minute to keep them in touch at 25-22 behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irish, playing their 15th and last test of a super-long Rugby World Cup season, rallied yet again and, as the match clock ticked into the red, Frawley let fly with another drop goal from the same length as the first and won a gripping match and squared a classic series. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wales' Rio Dyer dives in to score a try in the corner and set up a tense finale. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761485_1_20240714011612.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A resurgent Wallabies earned their first back-to-back rugby Test wins since 2021 on Saturday with a hard-fought 36-28 victory over Wales, who extended their horror run to nine straight defeats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Filipo Daugunu scored twice with Jake Gordon and Allan Alaalatoa also crossing on a wet and cold Melbourne night to back up their 25-16 triumph in Sydney a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took a 23-14 lead into the break and withstood intense second-half pressure and a series of handling errors to seal the series 2-0 and give new coach Joe Schmidt the second win of his tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was tough, bit of relief at the end there," said Wallabies skipper James Slipper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was scrappy from us for sure, it wasn't our best game, but we got the result. There's plenty to work on though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are gritty, they hang in there, they played our kicking game really well tonight," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat piled more pain on Warren Gatland's team which is now one loss away from equalling Wales' all-time record of 10 consecutive defeats, which came in 2002 and 2003 under another New Zealander, Steve Hansen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have slumped to 11th in the world rankings, below Fiji and Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite clawing back from 17-0 down after 25 minutes, they paid the price for conceding too many penalties and again lost the breakdown battle, sorely missing injured workhorse No 8 Aaron Wainwright.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We never gave up, we had a never-say-die attitude," said Wales captain Dewi Lake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But obviously we are a young team and we don't have enough experience really at Test level. What matters is results and we are not giving ourselves those at the moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taine Plumtree assumed Wainwright's role in the back row with James Botham, grandson of England cricket great Ian Botham, starting at blindside flanker and Tommy Reffell at openside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they were immediately exposed as Australia scored inside seven minutes with a move that started from near their own try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under pressure, wing Andrew Kellaway sidestepped the Welsh defence then collected his own chip before offloading to a charging Fraser McReight who powered up the field and found Daugunu to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the rain hammering down, they kept the pressure on with Lolesio making it 10-0 off the tee with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu made a try-saving tackle on Botham as Wales warmed to the task, but it was Australia who scored once more against the run of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scrum-half Gordon sent up a box kick and a handling error from fullback Cam Winnett allowed him to collect it and weave past two defenders to the try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undeterred, a well-worked rolling maul from the lineout saw Lake muscle over to get Wales on the board after half-an-hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Australia's Lukhan Salakaia-Loto in the sin-bin he repeated the feat soon afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both tries were converted to get Wales back in the game at 20-14 and an early converted try to veteran winger Liam Williams in the second-half put the Wallabies on notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the hosts proved they too could work a rolling maul, with Alaalatoa powering over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu got his second after a schoolboy error from Williams, who tried to keep the ball in play from a Wallabies kick, only to palm it perfectly to a charging Daugunu who surged to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Australia a 33-21 lead, but they went to sleep and Wales winger Rio Dyer smashed over in the corner to set up a tense finale. (AFP)

 Tadej Pogacar extended his overall lead on the Tour de France when he won stage 14 in the Pyrenees on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His arch rival Jonas Vingegaard came second at 39sec while Remco Evenepoel was third at 1min 10sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of another monster run in the Pyrenees on Sunday, Pogacar extended his lead to 1min 57sec over Vingegaard as Evenepoel dropped to third at 2min 22sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar's team UAE waited until the third and final climb of the day before sending Adam Yates on an attack that the Slovenian would soon join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Pogacar unleashed a ferocious acceleration, his two podium rivals followed, but were either unwilling or unable to match the pace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the final section of a climb, packed on either side by raucous fans, 2020 and 2021 champion Pogacar extended his lead. (AFP)

 Barbora Krejcikova won Wimbledon for her second Grand Slam title with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 victory over Jasmine Paolini in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is a 28-year-old from the Czech Republic who adds this trophy to her championship at the French Open in 2021 .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was unseeded in Paris back then and was only the 31st of 32 seeds at the All England Club after illness and a back injury this season limited her to a 7-9 record entering this tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is the eighth woman to leave Wimbledon as the champion in the past eight editions of the event. Last year's champion is also from the Czech Republic: unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, who lost in the first round last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seventh-seeded Paolini was the runner-up at the French Open last month and is the first woman since Serena Williams in 2016 to get to the finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same season. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New Zealand hung on to beat England after two tries from Mark Tele'a. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761467_1_20240713204131.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wing Mark Tele'a scored two tries on Saturday as New Zealand squeezed past England 24-17 to win a hard-fought second rugby Test in Auckland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tele'a touched down either side of half-time as the All Blacks took the series 2-0 and extended their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just like in the 16-15 first Test win at Dunedin, New Zealand had to wrestle back the lead in the second half from a spirited England side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hugely proud of the boys to hold on and win the arm wrestle and finish off a good performance," said New Zealand captain Scott Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Test matches certainly challenge your character and we had to dig deep there, right till the last minute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Marcus Smith led the visitors to a 14-13 advantage at half-time after his pin-point cross-field kicks created tries for wing Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a breathless opening spell, the All Blacks took the lead when Tele'a caught the England defence napping from a ruck to dart over for a try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All Blacks fly-half Damian McKenzie landed the conversion, but England immediately hit back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith kicked wide into the arms of Feyi-Waboso, who stepped inside the defence for a converted try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand should have had a second try when Tele'a broke away, but Smith intercepted the final pass to Stephen Perofeta on the England tryline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed a penalty, but Smith quickly took the kick-off to pin the All Blacks deep in their own half, where they stayed for the next 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie stroked over another penalty, but England led at half-time after Freeman outleapt Tele'a to haul in Smith's kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England number 10 successfully converted from the touchline .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England started the second-half camped in the All Blacks half and Smith extended the lead to 17-13 with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half an hour left, scrum-half Cortez Ratima came on to make his All Blacks debut when he replaced the dazed Finlay Christie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game's momentum swung New Zealand's way when the All Blacks brought on Beauden Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The twice world player of the year showed his class by restoring the lead for New Zealand when he scythed through a gap to put Tele'a over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie missed the conversion, but landed two penalties to pull New Zealand out of England's reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors fought until the end with England captain Jamie George denied near the New Zealand line from scoring a potential match-levelling try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're a significantly better team than we when we started," said England captain George.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's hugely exciting times ahead for this English team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll welcome them to Twickenham in November, we'll look forward to that." (AFP)

    Djokovic, Alcaraz to clash again in Wimbledon final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At 37, Novak Djokovic can become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he beats Carlos Alcaraz this time around. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761398_1_20240713031711.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic swept past Lorenzo Musetti on Friday to book a second successive Wimbledon final against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and move one win away from a record-setting 25th Grand Slam title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just five weeks after undergoing knee surgery, seven-time Wimbledon champion Djokovic reached his 10th final at the All England Club with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 win over the Italian 25th seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz earlier defeated Daniil Medvedev 6-7 (1/7), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach a fourth Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, can equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles and become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he avenges last year's dramatic five-set final loss to Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time Djokovic and Musetti met was at the French Open in June when the Serb claimed victory in a third round tie which ended at 3:07 in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, however, Djokovic was untroubled on his way to a 37th Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He broke for 4-2 lead in the opener and, despite surrendering the advantage and letting two set points slip in the ninth game, he broke again in the 10th to claim the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second seed was playing in his 49th Grand Slam semi-final while the 22-year-old Musetti was in his first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That experience was key as Djokovic hit back from losing serve in the opening game of the second set to level in the sixth before dominating the tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A break in the opening game of the third set launched him on his way to victory against a demoralised Musetti, who at least had the consolation of saving three match points before Djokovic completed his progress to yet another Wimbledon final. (AFP)

    England great Anderson ends Test career on a high

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"Playing for England is the best job in the world" said James Anderson. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761389_1_20240713002102.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England great James Anderson said he felt "really proud" after bringing down the curtain on a remarkable Test career with a thumping win over the West Indies at Lord's.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His final appearance before international retirement saw the 41-year-old paceman take a typically frugal 3-32 in 16 overs as the West Indies were dismissed for just 136 on Friday to give England victory by an innings and 114 runs inside three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England selectors had already agreed with Anderson that this first of a three-match series would represent his farewell to national on-field service as they look to rebuild ahead of the 2025/26 Ashes series in Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anderson, now set to mentor England's quicks for the rest of the season, bowed out with a remarkable 704 wickets from 188 Tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only spinners Shane Warne (708 Test wickets) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800) have enjoyed more bowling success at this level, with India batting hero Sachin Tendulkar (200 matches) the lone cricketer to have played more Tests than Anderson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been quite an amazing week," Anderson told Sky Sports. "I've been overwhelmed with the reaction of the crowd and everyone around the ground, and the lads as well. I'm just proud of what I've achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously this morning was quite emotional with the two teams lined up, and the reaction from the crowd was pretty special. I'm still trying to hold them (tears) back now but I think I am just really proud," added Anderson after ending his Test career where it started – with a debut against Zimbabwe at Lord's in 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for 20-odd years is an incredible effort, especially for a fast bowler, so I'm just happy that I've made it this far, happy that I've been lucky enough to stay injury-free pretty much throughout my career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for England is the best job in the world and I've been privileged to do it for a long time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England captain Ben Stokes hailed Anderson by saying: "He has just been an incredible inspiration to so many people...The amount of games and the amount of wickets he's taken are just absolutely phenomenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes you can be lost for words but if you gave me 15 minutes I wouldn't be able to compliment him enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a sense of a torch being passed at Lord's, with debutant fast bowler Gus Atkinson named player of the match following a sensational haul of 12-106.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By taking 12 wickets in his first Test, he managed something Anderson was unable to achieve in 188, with the Lancashire swing specialist's best match return at this level 11-71 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an incredible week," said Atkinson. "I just want to say thanks to Jimmy. Playing here in his last Test has been incredible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Surrey quick, asked if he had idolised Anderson as a child, replied: "A hundred percent. Growing up Jimmy was someone I would come to Lord's and watch. I was standing at mid-off thinking I had seen that so many times on the TV. It was amazing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite summed up many an opposition batsman's view of Anderson by saying: "He is a legend of the game. I won't miss him at all!" (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory over the final straight on Thursday to complete Stage 12 of the Tour de France in Villeneuve-sur-Lot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Girmay of Eritrea outlasted Wout van Aert of Belgium and Arnaud Demare of France to finish in 4 hours, 17 minutes, 15 seconds and capture his third stage of the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Ackermann of Germany ended up in third after Demare was demoted to 67th place for pushing van Aert to the barriers during the 204-km stage that brought riders from Aurillac to Villeneuve-sur-Lot in southwestern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time Grand Tour champion Primoz Roglic of Slovenia was involved in his second crash in as many days, with Thursday's slip-up coming near the finish line. Roglic finished 2:27 after Girmay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, there were no changes atop the leaderboard. Two-time Tour champion Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia retained the yellow jersey, 1:06 ahead of Belgium's Remco Evenepoel and 1:14 ahead of two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark.

    Krejcikova stuns Rybakina, faces Paolini in final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Barbora Krejcikova celebrates after beating Elena Rybakina on Centre Court at Wimbledon. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761246_1_20240712035538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in the Wimbledon final after battling back for a shock 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over former champion Elena Rybakina on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just hours after Paolini beat tearful Croatian Donna Vekic 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10/8) in the longest ever women's semi-final at the All England Club, it was Krejcikova's turn to dig deep for victory against fourth seeded Rybakina in two hours and seven minutes on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova faces seventh seed Paolini on Saturday in what will be the second Grand Slam final of the 28-year-old's career after her French Open triumph in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud about my game and my fighting spirit today," said Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech started 2024 with a run to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, but a first round exit at the French Open was a major setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She struggled with a back injury and illness, winning just three singles matches in the five months before finally finding her form in remarkable style at Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova shocked 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round and former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals, before turning her sights on Rybakina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-time Wimbledon doubles champion is now one win away from an unexpected triumph in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unbelievable. It is very tough to explain, but a lot of joy and a lot of emotions," Krejcikova said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I broke her in the second set, I started to be in the zone and I didn't want to leave the zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rybakina had been in formidable form, dropping just one set as she extended her impressive All England Club record to 19 wins from 21 matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old, who won Wimbledon in 2022, made a fast start with two quick breaks for an early 4-0 lead in a one-sided first set against Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her first Wimbledon semi-final, Krejcikova turned the tide in the second set, landing a priceless break in the sixth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She levelled the match on her sixth set point, making it the first time in 20 years that both Wimbledon women's semi-finals had gone to the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech held all the momentum and she eventually wore down Rybakina, who had committed over 35 unforced errors by the time she surrendered her serve in the decisive, seventh game of the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini had never won a main draw match at Wimbledon before this year, but the world number seven tenaciously saw off Vekic in two hours and 51 minutes to secure a second successive Grand Slam final appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old, who lost the French Open final to Iga Swiatek last month, is the first Italian woman to reach the Wimbledon final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini, who also made the Australia Open last 16 in January, had not gone past the second round in any Slam before this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without a win at the All England Club heading into the tournament, Paolini now has six victories under her belt and has dropped just two sets in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last months have been crazy for me. It is a dream. I was watching finals when I was a kid on this Wimbledon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know there is no place better than here to fight for every ball and every point. I will remember this forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vekic paid the price for 57 unforced errors, with the semi-final fittingly ending on another wild forehand from the unseeded Croatian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unable to contain her frustration at letting 3-1 and 4-3 leads slip in the last set, Vekic broke down in tears in the closing stages of a rollercoaster clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was crying because I had so much pain. I didn't know how I could keep playing," Vekic said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I was going to die in the third set. I had so much pain in my arm, in my leg." (AFP)

 Colombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uruguay's Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia went down to 10 men just before half-time when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.

 Ollie Watkins struck a stunning injury-time winner as England beat the Netherlands 2-1 on Wednesday to set up a Euro 2024 final showdown with Spain in Berlin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an incredible finish to an evening that began badly for England, as Xavi Simons gave the Netherlands an early lead in the semi-final in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, England were soon level through a Harry Kane penalty following a contentious VAR call by German referee Felix Zwayer, and the match looked set for extra time until Watkins struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On for Kane, Watkins received a pass from fellow substitute Cole Palmer with his back to goal in the first minute of stoppage time, turned and fired low into the far corner to leave the Netherlands bewildered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm lost for words really," said Watkins, the Aston Villa striker. "I don't think I've hit a ball that sweet before, and obviously in such a special moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has rarely been a convincing campaign from Gareth Southgate's England side, but they are through to their second consecutive European Championship final as they dream of finally winning a first major trophy since 1966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To do that they will surely have to perform better than at any point so far in Germany as they face an outstanding Spain team, who beat France 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands had been hoping to repeat their triumph at the last Euros in Germany, in 1988, but their current side lacks anyone with the star quality of Marco van Basten or Ruud Gullit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A victory for them would have seen this Euros conclude with the same final as the 2010 World Cup. Instead they now go home. (AFP)
