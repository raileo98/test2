 Adam Yates secured a sensational stage nine victory in the Vuelta a Espana on Sunday to revive his general classification hopes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British UAE Team Emirates rider went solo 58 kilometres from the finish in the Sierra Nevada mountains. He crossed the line one minute 39 seconds ahead of Richard Carapaz, who also put himself back in contention with a superb ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I never suffered like this before, it's so hot out there," said Yates. "From the last climb I was cramping and I didn't know if I could go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've had a lot of bad luck in Grand Tours over the years and I really didn't know if I could make it," he added. "But I'm just so happy I could finally win another Grand Tour stage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Ben O'Connor retained the red jersey and increased his lead on second placed Primoz Roglic to three minutes 53 seconds by claiming four bonus seconds as he finished third on the 178.5km run from Motril to Granada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every second counts, and I didn't lose time today – to some guys, yes – but in the end I showed my real capacity and what I can do, so I'm proud." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish champions Real Madrid earned a 3-0 win over Real Valladolid in La Liga on Sunday as Kylian Mbappé made his Santiago Bernabeu bow without finding the net.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atletico Madrid comfortably beat last season's surprise package Girona by the same scoreline later on in the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's French striker Mbappé played at home for the first time in a Los Blancos shirt but was largely frustrated by Valladolid's defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde opened the scoring after 50 minutes and substitutes Brahim Diaz and debutant Endrick struck late on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without the injured Jude Bellingham Madrid created little in the first half but did enough after the break to earn their first win of the season, following an opening draw at Real Mallorca.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still lacking fluency in attack, Carlo Ancelotti's side stayed two points behind rivals Barcelona, who beat Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.
  <br/>

  Mbappé scored on his debut in a UEFA Super Cup triumph but in La Liga, has failed to score in his opening two matches. (AFP)

    Norris beats Verstappen in Dutch Grand Prix

    <![CDATA[<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris celebrates on the podium after winning the Dutch Grand Prix with third placed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767598_1_20240826011450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Lando Norris stormed to victory at the Dutch Grand Prix on Sunday, a superb drive consigning home favourite Max Verstappen to his first-ever loss in front of his "Orange Army" fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The British driver claimed his second career chequered flag after winning in Miami in May, closing Verstappen's lead over him in the world championship to 70 points, with the Dutchman coming second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite raucous encouragement from a packed Zandvoort circuit, Verstappen could not extract enough from his Red Bull to compete with a recently upgraded McLaren that is beginning to look like the car to beat in Formula One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels amazing... The pace was very strong and the car was unbelievable today," said Norris, who also secured a point for the fastest lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The start was critical. Questions have been asked of the starting ability of Norris, who has three times this season failed to convert pole position into a first lap lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And again Norris was sluggish off the line, allowing Verstappen to power around the outside to huge cheers from the crowd, who saw their man take a 0.9-second advantage into the second lap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buoyed by the fast start, Verstappen clocked the quickest lap in lap two, putting clear daylight between him and the McLaren of Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the McLaren had been the fastest car in the paddock all race weekend and Norris started slowly but surely eating into Verstappen's lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 17 out of 72, Norris was only a few tenths of a second behind Verstappen, the Dutchman complaining on his team radio of a lack of grip from his tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris passed him a lap later on the outside at turn one, Verstappen powerless to prevent the overtake and quickly falling further behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't go faster. The car is not responding to my inputs," a desperate Verstappen told his engineers as Norris stretched his advantage to more than four seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On lap 25, Verstappen decided enough was enough and he needed a new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris pitted the lap after, his team taking 0.6 seconds longer than the Red Bull for the pit stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, Norris emerged from the two stops five seconds ahead of his rival and promptly produced the fastest lap of the race on his new set of tyres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By lap 40, Norris had extended the advantage to more than 10 seconds over the three-time champion and just had to stay out of trouble to take the chequered flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His eventual margin of victory was 22.896 seconds, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc holding off Norris's McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri to claim the third podium spot after a thrilling battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's struggling second driver Sergio Perez finished in sixth position, meaning the gap in the constructors' championship also narrowed from 42 points to 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wouldn't say a perfect race because of lap one again, but afterwards it was beautiful," said Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expected Max to start pushing and get a bit of a gap. And he never did. So from that point, I knew we were in with a good fight," added Norris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But he seemed to just keep dropping off. And my pace was getting better. So it's a nice feeling inside the car. And especially when I got past, you know, I could just get comfortable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The F1 circus now moves on to the famous Monza track in Italy next weekend, round 16 of 24 with everyone snapping at Verstappen's heels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen has not won a Grand Prix since Barcelona in June, his longest barren spell since 2020 and while it is premature to talk of panic stations at Red Bull, the Dutch weekend will have given some cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You always try to do better and we had a good start, we tried everything we could today, but throughout the race it was quite clear that we are not quick enough, so I tried to be second today," said Verstappen. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chelsea's Noni Madueke holds the match ball after scoring a hat-trick. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767597_1_20240826004756.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 at Molineux on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chelsea's first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca's side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer, but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves fell part after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side's sixth goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much has been made of Chelsea's huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea's league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today means a lot. I was really just trying to be clever and wait for the right moment," Madueke said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unbelievable. (Palmer) is cold and I am fire so it mixes well. He has the ability to always play a pass at the right time. I like to get the ball in space, beat people and make things happen, so luckily today it worked."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair combined to restore Chelsea's lead in the 49th minute with the 22-year-old Madueke getting lucky as his shot deflected off of Rayan Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That goal sapped the fight out of Wolves and it was Palmer again who sent the over-lapping Madueke clear to slam a shot through the legs of Wolves keeper Jose Sa's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madueke made it 5-2 with an almost identical goal as Wolves conceded possession and Cole sent him clear to complete his hat-trick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves will wonder what happened after they played some enterprising football in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were caught cold when Jackson headed Chelsea in front after two minutes but deservedly levelled in the 27th minute when Cunha fired home after being set up by Ait-Nouri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wolves pressed for a second but it was Chelsea who went back in front on the stroke of halftime with Palmer producing a delightful lobbed finish from 30 metres with his left foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea were caught out again in first-half stoppage time, however, as Norwegian Strand Larsen opened his Wolves account, stretching out his foot to convert from close range after a free kick was headed across the penalty area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Newcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara's effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought the game was lost because I initially hadn't seen anything wrong with the goal," said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe who was given a warm reception on his return to his old club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have had it for us and against us and we are very grateful for that moment because we have battled hard. But I understand that it is a contentious decision." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong martial arts actor Jackie Chan was named on Sunday as one of the torchbearers in the lead-up to the opening ceremony of the Paralympics in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 70-year-old, known for his stunts and acrobatic fight scenes, will carry the flame on Wednesday afternoon in the French capital just hours before the opening ceremony, the organising committee announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French actress Elsa Zylberstein, and dancer/choreographer Benjamin Millepied will also take part in the torch relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As with the Olympic opening ceremony, Wednesday's event will take place beyond the confines of the Stade de France, with a parade down the Champs-Elysees to the Place de la Concorde in central Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame, which was was lit on Saturday in Stoke Mandeville in the UK, the historic birthplace of the Paralympic Games, arrived in France via the Channel Tunnel on Sunday, carried by wheelchair fencing medalist Emmanuelle Assmann.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about inscribing sport in the hearts of people with disabilities," said French sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera who was on hand to welcome the flame, alongside Tony Estanguet, head of the organising committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flame was due to continue its journey where it would be "multiplied" into 12 Paralympic flames, which will be carried by 1,000 torchbearers in around 50 towns, in 12 simultaneous relays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These 12 relays will converge on Paris, where the flame will arrive on Wednesday for the opening ceremony. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United crashed to a last-gasp 2-1 defeat against Brighton and an Erling Haaland's hat-trick fired Premier League champions Manchester City to a 4-1 win against Ipswich on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erik ten Hag's side were left shell-shocked by Joao Pedro's winner five minutes into stoppage-time at the Amex Stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United fell behind to a 32nd minute goal from Danny Welbeck, who poked in Kaoru Mitoma's cross for his sixth goal in 16 appearances against his former club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amad Diallo equalised for United after an hour, cutting inside for a shot that deflected in off Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joshua Zirkzee prevented Alejandro Garnacho from putting the visitors ahead in the closing stages when the United forward touched home his team-mate's finish on the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, a close-season signing from Bologna, was in an offside position and VAR ruled out the goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Left completely unmarked at the far post, Brazilian striker Pedro rubbed salt into United's wounds as he headed home from Simon Adingra's cross to ensure Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler maintained his 100 per cent start following last weekend's win at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old German is the youngest permanent manager in Premier League history after arriving from St Pauli to replace Roberto De Zerbi in the close-season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My team deserved to win. These moments make memories and we have to enjoy it," Hurzeler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag added: "Both goals are very soft. As a team, we should have done better. We have to be more clinical in both boxes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City scored three times in four minutes to survive an early scare against promoted Ipswich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sammie Szmodics, signed from Blackburn in the close-season, gave Ipswich a shock lead in the seventh minute, running on to Omari Hutchinson's pass and squeezing his shot through Ederson's legs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City levelled when Leif Davis's 12th minute foul on Savinho conceded a penalty that Haaland dispatched with ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ipswich keeper Arijanet Muric spent four years with City before leaving in 2022 and he returned with a gift for his old club, dwelling in possession in the 14th minute as Kevin De Bruyne stole the ball and slotted home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City made it three when the unstoppable Haaland flicked De Bruyne's deft pass past Muric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German midfielder Ilkay Gundogan came off the bench for City in the second half after rejoining his former club from Barcelona on a one-year contract on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland completed his treble in the 88th minute with a typically predatory finish for his fourth goal already this season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma got back in favour with boss Ange Postecoglou as his superb strike inspired a 4-0 rout of Everton in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postecoglou picker Bissouma following a one-game suspension after posting a social media video that showed him inhaling nitrous oxide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know what it's like when you punish your child and they do everything right for the next two days?" Postecoglou had said of Bissouma's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mali international made the most of his reprieve in the 14th minute, lashing home from the edge of the area for his first league goal for Tottenham in his 52nd appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Son Heung-min doubled Tottenham's lead in the 25th minute, forcing Jordan Pickford into an embarrassing mistake as the Everton keeper was robbed by the South Korean for a simple finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cristian Romero headed Tottenham's third in the 71st minute. Son bagged his second with a clinical finish six minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui earned the first win of his reign as second half goals from Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen sealed a 2-0 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Iwobi's 70th minute goal clinched Fulham's 2-1 win against Leicester at Craven Cottage after Emile Smith Rowe's first half opener for the hosts was cancelled out by Wout Faes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nottingham Forest won 1-0 at Southampton thanks to Morgan Gibbs-White's 70th minute strike.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 65 national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics – most of them gold medallists – will visit Hong Kong next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They include diving duo Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, winners of the women's synchronised 10m platform, as well as table tennis champions such as Ma Long, Fan Zhendong and Sun Yingsha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also among the list are swimmer Zhang Yufei, who won six medals in Paris, breaking bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, as "671", and street skateboarder Cui Chenxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the nation's first Olympic tennis champion, Zheng Qinwen, will not be on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes from 16 sports will be joined by eight coaches, and led by director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan. They will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong from August 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will attend a gala show before showcasing their skills at two demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park swimming pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for all three events were sold out in about half an hour on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will also attend a reception and a banquet hosted by the SAR government, and meet local athletes at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, before heading to neighbouring Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team bagged 40 gold medals at the Paris Games, on top of 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian cyclist Ben O'Connor soloed to a stunning victory in stage six of the Vuelta a España on Thursday, taking the red jersey from three-time winner Primoz Roglic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale rider and Gijs Leemreize attacked from a breakaway group before O'Connor later left the Dutchman behind with 27 kilometres to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor opened up a defendable lead of four minutes 51 seconds in the general classification ahead of veteran Roglic, as the peloton came in well over six minutes down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt a little bit in my own world today. I just went for it, I felt today was just a day to seize my opportunity and I laid it all out there," O'Connor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I could win this stage from the start – it's pretty special when you can just go out and crush it like that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connor became the fifth Australian to win stages at all three Grand Tours after winning at the Giro in 2020 and at the Tour de France in 2021. (AFP)

    Chelsea give Maresca first win in Conference League

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The victory is Maresca's first with Chelsea. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767297_1_20240823082205.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea secured their first victory under new coach Enzo Maresca with a 2-0 victory over Servette in their Conference League play-off round first leg on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hosts struggled to break down their opponents in the first half at Stamford Bridge before Christopher Nkunku put them in front with a 50th-minute penalty, just his fourth goal for the club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guiu somehow contrived to miss an open goal a few minutes later, but Noni Madueke moved Chelsea closer to a group-stage place ahead of next week's second leg by firing home from Enzo Fernandez's pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiemoko Ouattara almost pulled one back for Swiss side Servette late on when his deflected strike hit the crossbar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a welcome win for Chelsea after suffering a 2-0 loss in Maresca's debut game against Manchester City at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Blues are making their return to European competition after finishing sixth in the Premier League last season under Mauricio Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are learning how to manage the game," said Maresca, who led Leicester to promotion to the Premier League last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was important to win the game with nine changes. There were many good things," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was a scare for Chelsea, as key player Cole Palmer went down the dug-out holding the back of his leg at full-time after coming on as a second-half substitute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cole felt something but he looks fine. Hopefully it is no problem and he can be available for Sunday's game against Wolves," Maresca said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets to local demonstrations by mainland Olympians who did well at the Paris Games were all snapped up in a little more than half an hour on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were some 5,000 tickets available for the public to go to two demonstrations on August 31, and a gala show the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The events are part of a three-day visit by the delegation to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people joined an online queue for the HK$20 tickets when they went on sale at 10am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two demonstrations, at Victoria Park Swimming Pool and Queen Elizabeth Stadium, will feature divers, swimmers, gymnasts, as well as table tennis and badminton players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said those who bought the tickets need to collect them at URBTIX outlets or from self-service ticketing kiosks on or before August 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After departing Hong Kong, members of the national team will spend three days in Macau.

    De Silva stars in Sri Lanka revival against England

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England trailed Sri Lanka by 214 runs on day one of the first test after bad light stopped play on Wednesday at Old Trafford where the tourists' decision to bat first backfired when they were all out for 236.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva won the toss and opted to bat under cloudy skies but his side were three down for six runs after seven overs before he led their recovery efforts with a confident knock of 74 in the middle order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England were 22 for no loss in four overs with Ben Duckett and Dan Lawrence at the crease. Sri Lanka, who were unable to get their fast bowlers to use the new ball in fading light, opted to walk off with a few minutes left until stumps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a good day. When you bowl on day one on a test surface like that, to be batting at the end of the day I think you're really happy," said England's Chris Woakes, who took 3-32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a hard pitch offering assistance for England's seam attack in the first innings, Sri Lanka's openers were stifled early on as the bowlers dominated the opening session to reduce the visitors to 80-5 at lunch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England, captained by Ollie Pope with Ben Stokes ruled out with a hamstring injury, were left frustrated when De Silva stitched together a valuable 63-run partnership with test debutant Milan Rathnayake, who came in at number nine. (Reuters)

    Maresca: Chelsea 'not a mess' after more transfers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maresca at Chelsea's season opener against Man City at Stamford Bridge. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767146_1_20240822082401.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca insisted Wednesday he was not presiding over a "mess" of a squad after the London club were involved in yet more transfer activity.
 <br>
  <br/>
  João Felix signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge, with his return from Atletico Madrid to the club where he spent an underwhelming spell on loan in the 2022-23 season helping facilitate Conor Gallagher's move in the opposite direction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca now has one of the largest squads in the Premier League at his disposal, although he has made it clear Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell are not part of his plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking ahead of Chelsea's Conference League play-off against Servette, Maresca said criticism of the club's transfer policy had been unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not working with 42 players, I am working with 21 players in first-team training," the Italian said. "It's not a mess like it looks from outside. The other players can even have 20 years contract, it is not my point. I don't care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the position of Sterling and Chilwell, he added: "In this moment, they are training apart from the squad. As I said, the situation with both of them is quite clear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a big squad, for me it's impossible to give everyone minutes so if they're looking for minutes, probably it is better to leave. And in case they don't leave, they have a contract here, they are Chelsea players."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he was understandably more upbeat about João Felix, with Maresca – whose side started the new Premier League season with a 2-0 defeat by champions Manchester City last weekend, saying: "He is a good player, a talent. The club already knows him from two years ago."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He can play different positions with us, inside, as a nine, outside," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No transfer fee was revealed for the former Benfica star, who made two appearances for Portugal at Euro 2024. (AFP)

 Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, a 2014 World Cup winner, announced his retirement from international football on Wednesday at the age of 38.

  Neuer wrote on social media that although he was tempted to play until the 2026 World Cup, he was "convinced that now is the right time to take this step."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He shone at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and was named as the tournament's best goalkeeper as Germany won the trophy for the fourth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer revealed he had made the announcement after discussions with his family, as well as a comprehensive conversation with Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he planned to "concentrate fully" on playing for Bayern, with whom he has won two Champions Leagues and 11 Bundesliga titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This season's Champions League final will take place at Munich's Allianz Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer broke his leg in a skiing accident in December 2022 and only returned to the Germany squad just ahead of Euro 2024 on home soil, reclaiming his role as first choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great time which shaped me and of which I am very proud," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winning the World Cup title in 2014 and the special atmosphere during the European Championship at home this year are highlights for which I am extremely grateful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was an honour for me to be captain of our national team until 2023. I loved wearing the Germany jersey."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neuer follows fellow 2014 World Cup winners Thomas Mueller and Toni Kroos, who both played at Euro 2024, into international retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, current Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan, who missed the 2014 World Cup campaign through injury, also announced he had played his last game at international level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A product of the Schalke academy in his home town of Gelsenkirchen, Neuer made his international debut in 2009 and has more caps than any other Germany goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany won 81 of the 124 matches Neuer played in, and he kept 51 clean sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The retirement clears the way for long-time back-up Marc Andre ter Stegen of Barcelona, who is expected to take over from the Bayern captain as Germany's number one. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary golfer Gary Player, who won more than 160 professional tournaments over a career that spanned seven decades, will feature at the Fanling course in November as an ambassador of the LINK Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South African player hailed the tournament as “Asia’s Major”, marking “golf's development in China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Taichi Kho, the first player from the SAR to win on the Asian Tour, said he was excited to return to his home Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s the event I've been looking forward to the whole year and whether I play well or not, I know everyone has my back and I feel so much support from the local crowd and the Hong Kong Golf Club and everyone involved,” said Kho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think golf is a sport that comes and goes. Sometimes you score well and sometimes you don't. But I feel very proud of the fact that I've been able to stay focused all year and stay disciplined to do what I set out to do.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So it hasn't surprised me that my golf has come along nicely the second half of the year and I look forward to continuing that momentum into the final stretch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year’s champion, Ben Campbell of New Zealand, will also play to defend his title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 2024 Open will take place from November 21 to 24, featuring a prize purse of US$2 million.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students who got to meet Hong Kong's Olympians in person on Wednesday said they learnt a valuable lesson.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sharing session, which followed an open-top bus parade by the athletes, took place behind closed doors inside government headquarters in Tamar and lasted about half an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charlie, who trains in track and field, said she found out what it takes to become an elite athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a great opportunity for us student athletes to have a better understanding of how high, elite-level athletes, how they compete, what they prepare mentally, physically and also maybe psychologically on such a big stage, the Olympic stage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it's a great experience for us to know more about the profession, and also it allows us to be more motivated for our own respective sport."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the session, the athletes headed outdoors to meet fans who had been waiting at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Siobhan Haughey drew cheers everywhere she went, and she stopped to sign autographs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians then gathered on the lawn for a photo with some primary school pupils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes' packed schedule was set to continue in the afternoon with a lunch hosted by Chief Executive John Lee, followed by a joint reception by the SAR government and the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China.

 The Hong Kong, China delegation to the Paris Olympics on Wednesday received a hero's welcome around town, with excited fans braving the rain to applaud the athletes on board two open-top buses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 90-minute parade featured members of the team such as Paris gold medallist and fencing queen Vivian Kong and swimming star Siobhan Haughey, who took home two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's only two-time Olympic champion, fencer Edgar Cheung, did not attend the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two buses carrying the star-studded delegation set off from the Hong Kong Sports Institute in Sha Tin and passed by Tai Wai MTR station, the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower and the Central Star Ferry Pier, considered the best viewing locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shirley, one of hundreds of onlookers, voiced her support for the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All athletes are worthy of our attention, because everyone has to put in time and effort. Not just the champions and runners-up, but all Hong Kong athletes. They all deserve our applause," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Su was part of the enthusiastic crowds in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so excited. It was amazing. I yelled the loudest at the scene. I cheered for Vivian Kong, Siobhan Haughey, and Hong Kong. I told Vivian Kong not to cry, and to give us smiles," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dan, who's from California, said: "I think it's great. Hong Kong needs to support its athletes and its sports people more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a good way to meet the people of Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes received roaring applause as they arrived at Tamar Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alice, 11, said she got an autograph from Haughey towards the end of the parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that she is very perseverant. When she sets a goal, she won't give up. I also swim, so we are kind of the same person," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The athletes] did a great job and I want them to keep going and never give up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR team bagged two gold and two bronze medals at the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City forward Phil Foden won the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foden played a key role in City winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive Premier League title last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old scored 19 times and delivered eight assists for Pep Guardiola's team as they pipped Arsenal to the title on the last day of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win this award is something very special and it is one that I am very proud of and grateful for. To be recognised this way by your fellow professionals means everything and I would like to thank everyone who voted for me," Foden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also want to pay special thanks to Pep, the City coaches and all my teammates as they help me to try and get better every single day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden has already set his sights on a fifth successive Premier League crown after City started their title defence with a 2-0 win at Chelsea on Sunday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 Women's T20 World Cup scheduled for October has been moved out of Bangladesh and will instead take place in the United Arab Emirates, the International Cricket Council announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision to change the venue comes after unrest that led to the overthrow of prime minister Sheikh Hasina after 15 years of iron-fisted rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 450 people were killed in the weeks of protests leading up to her August 5 ouster, most by police fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank the team at the BCB (Bangladesh Cricket Board) for exploring all avenues to try and enable the event to be hosted in Bangladesh," ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But travel advisories from the governments of a number of the participating teams meant that wasn't feasible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "However, they will retain hosting rights. We look forward to taking an ICC global event to Bangladesh in the near future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tournament will be staged October 3-20 across two venues in the UAE – Dubai and Sharjah. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World men's number one Jannik Sinner has been cleared of fault or negligence after failing two drug tests in March, the International Tennis Integrity Authority (ITIA) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An independent tribunal accepted Sinner's explanation that the contamination of banned substance clostebol happened when a member of his support team applied an over-the-counter spray on to treat a small wound of their own earlier this year, the ITIA said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That support team member applied the spray between 5 and 13 March, during which time they also provided daily massages and sports therapy to Sinner, resulting in unknowing transdermal contamination," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ruling is subject to appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the ITIA added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, on Tuesday recorded the first senior Grand Slam victory of his career, after beating Chile's Cristian Garin in the first qualifying round of the US Open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong went a set down, 4-6, before fighting back 7-6, 6-3 for the victory against Garin, who's now ranked 116th in the world but was once as high as 17th in 2021 and made it the Wimbledon quarter-finals in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China player is currently ranked 38 spots lower than the Chilean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong will next play Chinese Taipei's Hsu Yu-hsiou in the second round of qualifiers. Hsu is ranked 185th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are three rounds of qualifiers in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The draw for the main round of the men's singles will be made at Friday midnight, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 20-year-old Wong won the Australian Open junior doubles title two years ago.

  The third seed – who missed Wimbledon with a shoulder injury – won a trophy for the first time since collecting her second Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played in the final and that I was able to get this title. It's really important going into the US Open," Sabalenka said. "I'm sure Jess and I will have more battles in the future – let's keep it up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in the men's draw, world number one Jannik Sinner defeated Frances Tiafoe in straight sets to secure his maiden Cincinnati Open championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner claimed his fifth victory of the season in emphatic style, swatting aside Tiafoe 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in 1hr 36min to underscore his credentials for next Monday's US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian top seed bided his time in the first set before breaking the match open in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tiafoe, whose game faded after losing the first-set tiebreaker, still made an impression. The American, who moves into the ranking top-20, saved three match points before Sinner claimed his 15th career title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cincinnati is the fifth trophy of 2024 for the 23-year-old Italian, who began the season with an Australian Open title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy, this was a very difficult week," Sinner said. "It was tough mentally but I tried to do my best. I'm just glad I kept my level in the important moments. I handled the situations on court well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win was Sinner's third in an ATP Masters event after previous victories in Toronto and Miami. (AFP)

 Dan Lawrence will open the batting for England in the first Test of a three-match series against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, while Matthew Potts has been drafted in to compensate for the loss of captain Ben Stokes to injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawrence has only operated as an opener a handful of times in his first-class career but returns to the England side for the first time in two-and-a-half years after Zak Crawley's fractured finger opened up a vacancy at the top of the order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, 25-year-old Potts provides an extra bowling option with all-rounder Stokes set to miss the entire series after tearing his hamstring during The Hundred. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thierry Henry has decided to step down from his role as coach of the France under-21 football team, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former France international Henry made the decision after guiding the under-23 side to a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The all-time leading goalscorer for Premier League giants Arsenal took over as coach of the French youth side last summer and was under contract until June 2025 but decided to step away for "personal reasons", according to the FFF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry oversaw Les Bleuets' first run to the final of an Olympics men's tournament since winning gold in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His young side eventually went down 5-3 after extra time against Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The loss ended a promising run that had started inauspiciously after Henry was obliged to make several changes to his squad pre-tournament, due to the refusal of certain clubs to release their players for the Games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany captain Ilkay Gundogan announced his retirement from international football on Monday after leading his country at Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "After a few weeks of reflection, I have come to the conclusion that it is time to end my national team career," Gundogan said in a German FA statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look back with great pride on 82 international matches for my home country – a number that I could never have dreamed of when I made my debut for the senior national team in 2011."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan, who turns 34 in October, was in the Germany team that reached the Euro 2024 quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions Spain after extra time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My highlight was clearly the huge honour of being able to lead the team as captain at our home European Championship last summer," said the Barcelona midfielder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gundogan made his debut for Germany against Belgium in October 2011 but missed their 2014 World Cup triumph with a back injury. He was also ruled out of Euro 2016 due to a dislocated kneecap. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Equestrian athlete Natasha Tse left for Britain on Monday for two final weeks of training ahead of the Paris Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Growing up with cerebral palsy, which hinders movement and muscle control, Tse embraced horse-riding at a young age of four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making her Paralympic debut in London at just 15, the veteran is gearing up for her fourth Games in early September, where she'll be competing in the individual para dressage event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this time, Tse is bringing two “horses”. Check out our video to find out why.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé was left frustrated on his Real Madrid La Liga debut on Sunday as a resilient Real Mallorca held the Spanish and European champions to a 1-1 draw in their title defence opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French superstar was thwarted by Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif and after Rodrygo Goes sent Madrid ahead early on the hosts levelled in the second half through Vedat Muriqi's towering header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's star-studded side struggled to break down Mallorca, who came closer to winning the game in the final stages at Son Moix stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Los Blancos defender Ferland Mendy was sent off in stoppage time for a high challenge on Muriqi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We went ahead, we had chances to score the second, and then in the second half we lacked balance," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We conceded counter-attacks, it was not a good game, it was quite a clear game to see that we need to defend better and have better balance on the pitch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ancelotti selected the same starting line-up which defeated Atalanta to win the Uefa Super Cup on Thursday, with Jude Bellingham in midfield behind the Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo attacking line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé scored in that victory but the former Paris Saint-Germain forward was unable to celebrate his first match in his new homeland with another goal. (AFP)

    Niewiadoma wins Tour de France Femmes by four seconds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma won her first women's Tour de France title by just four seconds on Sunday as she dug in during the race's gruelling final Alpine ascent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old Canyon SRAM rider summited the daunting Alpe d'Huez mountain one minute one second behind stage winner Demi Vollering to maintain her grip on the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so crazy to be honest, the whole stage was such a crazy rollercoaster," said a visibly emotional Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've gone through such a terrible time on this climb, like I hated everything, then to arriving at the finish line and learning that I won Tour de France, which is insane. It's so mind-blowing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour was turned upside down on Thursday during the fifth stage when Vollering was caught up in a huge crash six kilometres from the finish in Amneville, losing 1min 47sec on the leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After third-placed finishes in the previous two Tours and a disappointing eighth-place finish at the 2024 Olympic Games road race, the victory tasted even sweeter for Niewiadoma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think last year's third place was there to reward me with this victory and same as two weeks ago I was so disappointed getting stuck behind a crash during the Olympics," said the Limanowa-native.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like during this week, all the stars aligned for my team and for myself." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former Chelsea favourite Mateo Kovacic, (centre), beats Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez at his near post. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766678_1_20240819022912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City got their Premier League title defence off to a winning start as goals from Erling Haaland and Mateo Kovacic inflicted a 2-0 defeat on Enzo Maresca in his first match in charge of Chelsea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haaland marked his 100th appearance for the club with his 91st goal before Kovacic struck on his return to Stamford Bridge to give Pep Guardiola's men the perfect start to their attempt to win a record fifth consecutive English top-flight title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City were shorn of all four of their Euro 2024 finalists – Rodri, Kyle Waker, John Stones and Phil Foden – from the start as Guardiola opted to give them extra time off to recover from their summer exertions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet, the champions were still able to lay down a marker against one of the few sides they failed to beat in the league last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maresca has the tough task of moulding a functioning team unit from a bloated Chelsea squad that has 43 players and over 50 on the books including those on loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consequences of those difficult decisions played out even before kick-off as Raheem Sterling's camp released a statement expressing his dismay at being left out of the matchday squad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Chilwell was another to face the cull, while Conor Gallagher and Romelu Lukaku are among those not to have been handed squad numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  None of Chelsea's nine summer signings to date were included in Maresca's starting line-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even more surprisingly, Enzo Fernandez was named captain despite being embroiled in a race row for a post on social media after Argentina's Copa America victory last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City, by contrast, are a model of continuity and consistent excellence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haaland was one of City's few stars to have had a summer off from international tournaments and took just 18 minutes to make his mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeremy Doku's low cross was deflected by Bernardo Silva into the Norwegian's path and he coolly dinked over Robert Sanchez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin De Bruyne curled inches wide and Sanchez leapt high to turn over Doku's deflected shot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chelsea ended the first half in the ascendency and should have been level before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ederson spilled Cole Palmer's tame shot but was bailed out by Nicolas Jackson's straying needlessly offside before he turned in the rebound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foden was forced into action earlier than Guardiola would have hoped at half-time as the lively Savinho was forced off injured on his Premier League debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lack of pre-season minutes for many on show was apparent in the more pedestrian pace than normal for a major Premier League clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chelsea did most of the pressing for an equaliser but offered City chances to extend their lead in doing so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez made a fine save to deny Haaland a second before De Bruyne again fired inches off target when unmarked at the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Chelsea goalkeeper was at fault for the goal that sealed their fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kovacic was allowed to burst through the midfield unchallenged and took aim for the top corner, which he found thanks to a weak hand from Sanchez. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brentford shrugged off the absence of Ivan Toney to get their Premier League season off to a flying start with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa got the goals for the Bees, who had left out England international Toney over speculation surrounding his future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toney has less than a year left to run on his contract with the London club and is attracting interest from Saudi clubs after his role in helping England to the Euro 2024 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brentford boss Thomas Frank said pre-match his side had shown last season they can cope without Toney – who missed much of last term due to a betting ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marc Guehi did captain Crystal Palace despite the interest in him shown by Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England defender had an outstanding Euros but a moment to forget for Brentford's opening goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbeumo raced onto Wissa's pass and cut inside Guehi before firing into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palace ended last season in sensational form under Oliver Glasner and will feel hard done by not to have earned at least a point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eberechi Eze had a brilliantly executed near post free-kick harshly ruled out for a foul by Will Hughes when the score was still level at 0-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bright Palace start to the second half was rewarded when Ethan Pinnock turned Daniel Munoz's header into his own goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seconds later, Odsonne Edouard slotted home Eze's pass only to be denied by a marginal offside decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was Brentford who grabbed the vital third goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dean Henderson could only parry Nathan Collins' shot straight into the path of Wissa, who bundled home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eze was twice denied by Mark Flekken in the closing stages but Brentford held out for an impressive three points. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Liverpool manager Arne Slot and first team individual development coach Aaron Briggs watch the game. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766596_1_20240817223239.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arne Slot got off to a winning start as Liverpool manager with a 2-0 win at newly-promoted Ipswich on Saturday as Arsenal began their Premier League title challenge by beating Wolves by the same scoreline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newcastle defied an early red card for Fabian Schar to edge past Southampton 1-0, while Brighton ran riot under new manager Fabian Hurzeler in a 3-0 victory at Everton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot has huge shoes to fill at Anfield after the departure of Jurgen Klopp, who restored the Reds to the top of the English game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman was left less than impressed by his side's first 45 minutes at Portman Road as Ipswich flew out of the traps on their return to the Premier League for the first time in 22 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Liverpool were a different side after the break as goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah barely reflected their dominance to get Slot off to the perfect start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We as a team made a big change at half-time because we came out totally different to how we had come out in the first half," said the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second half, we won more duels, we won more second balls and we played more balls in behind because if the other team takes the risk of playing one-v-one and you have the likes of Luis Diaz, Mo Salah and Diogo Jota then use them, play the balls in behind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arsenal have finished second to Manchester City in each of the past two seasons and are highly-fancied to be the champions' closest challengers again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kai Havertz opened the scoring at the Emirates from Bukayo Saka's cross to reward the Gunners' early dominance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mikel Arteta's men needed a vital save from David Raya to deny Jorgen Strand Larsen and Matheus Cunha missed a huge chance to level before Arsenal made the points safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The roles from the first goal were reversed as this time Havertz teed up Saka to lash home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newcastle's hopes of a winning start to the season looked to have been undone when Schar was sent off after just 28 minutes for what the referee deemed a headbutt on Ben Brereton Diaz despite limited contact between the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southampton had dominated even the early exchanges against the Magpies' full compliment but failed to convert from 19 shots and nearly 80 percent possession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Newcastle were clinical as Alexander Isak teed up Joelinton for the only goal just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Everton's final season at Goodison Park got off to a nightmare start as 31-year-old Hurzeler enjoyed a dream start to life in the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaoru Mitoma fired Brighton in front on his return from injury that saw the Japanese international miss much of last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Welbeck added a second after the break before Everton were reduced to 10 men when Ashley Young saw red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Adingra made it 3-0 late on and only a VAR review denied Brighton a fourth through Yasin Ayari.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Semenyo stepped into the void left at Bournemouth by the departure of Dominic Solanke with a late equaliser to salvage a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City begin their defence of the title in the standout fixture of the weekend at Chelsea on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manchester United got their campaign off to a winning start on Friday when debutant Joshua Zirkzee came off the bench to grab a late winner in a 1-0 victory over Fulham. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand thumped Argentina 42-10 on Saturday as Will Jordan grabbed two of their six tries in The Rugby Championship to avenge last week's shock defeat by the Pumas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Damian McKenzie scored 17 points in Auckland as the All Blacks defied wet conditions in a skilled attacking display to maintain their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was vast improvement on the 38-30 loss in Wellington last week, with an explosive first-half performance pushing the hosts 35-3 ahead through five converted tries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was built on a dominant display from the forwards, who heeded the call for "redemption" issued to them by coach Scott Robertson after they were outplayed a week earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina's scrum was overpowered and they weren't the same force at the breakdown in a performance punctuated by mistakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their lone try came late in the match to fullback Juan Cruz Mallia, meaning the second half was drawn 7-7, helped by tighter defence from the visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was New Zealand's best performance under first-year coach Robertson in his fifth match in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory continued New Zealand's remarkable record in Auckland, where they've won 50 Tests since their last defeat, against France in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed all his six conversion attempts and his general play was superior to the first Test, mixing an astute long kicking game with some clever chips to counter the Pumas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The playmaker also opened the scoring with a try after pouncing on a chip from Jordie Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santiago Carreras responded with a Pumas penalty goal before New Zealand captain Ardie Savea powered over for his 27th Test try -- lifting him level with former skipper Richie McCaw for the most by an All Blacks forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Caleb Clarke and Jordan were both put into space for tries -- the latter capitalising on a blindside break from scrum-half TJ Perenara.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie's sweetly timed pass put Beauden Barrett across just before the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan continued the rout soon after the break, lifting him to 33 tries in as many Tests in his first starting appearance since last year's World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game entered a lull before Mallia's try and a late yellow card was shown to All Blacks hooker Asafo Aumua for a high tackle. (AFP)

    Manchester United see off Fulham after shaky start

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes celebrates after the match. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766529_1_20240817053109.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joshua Zirkzee made himself a Manchester United hero on his debut with a late winner to beat Fulham 1-0 in the opening match of the Premier League season on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zirkzee, lacking match fitness after his move from Bologna last month, came on only for the final half hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch international saved the Red Devils from a frustrating evening at Old Trafford when he poked in Alejandro Garnacho's cross on 87 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To win here in my first home game and to grab a goal, it couldn't be better," said Zirkzee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been told (scoring at the Stretford End) is one of the best feelings at Manchester United. I'm so thankful and blessed I could experience it in my first game. It's an amazing feeling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United boss Erik ten Hag survived at the end of last season, despite finishing eighth in the Premier League, thanks to winning the FA Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether that shock victory over rivals and English champions Manchester City in May could be a springboard remains to be seen after a performance that was eerily reminiscent of many last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag said on the eve of the game that his side were "not ready" for the new campaign with key players missing through injury or a lack of match fitness, and it showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bruno Fernandes started in a centre-forward role in the absence of Rasmus Hojlund, while Zirkzee was on the bench after returning to pre-season late following Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noussair Mazraoui was thrown straight into the starting line-up at left-back after joining from Bayern Munich this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was no place in the squad for Jadon Sancho even though the winger and Ten Hag appeared to have settled their differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fulham won at Old Trafford last season for the first time in 20 years in February during a torrid campaign for United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Little seemed to have changed in the opening 20 minutes as the visitors started confidently and Andre Onana did well to prevent Kenny Tete's dipping effort finding the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fulham were nearly masters of their own downfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro pounced on Bernd Leno's sloppy pass and teed up Fernandes, who could only fire straight at Fulham's German goalkeeper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Casemiro's struggles played a large part in United's problems last season, but the Brazilian started the new campaign more like his old self.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An incisive through ball from the former Real Madrid midfielder created another brilliant chance for Fernandes, who again could not beat Leno from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United's lack of a predatory striker continued to haunt them after the break as Leno spread himself brilliantly to this time deny Mason Mount a rare goal since his move from Chelsea just over a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten Hag turned to Garnacho and Zirkzee from the bench in the search of a winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In doing so United left themselves open and Fulham could have secured another famous three points at the Theatre of Dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andreas Pereira's poor pass cost Alex Iwobi the chance to run clean through on goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments later Lisandro Martinez produced a goal-saving clearance from Pereira's dangerous low cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead it was the home side that snatched all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garnacho's ball from the right was not the best, but Zirkzee managed to get a toe on it to divert it beyond Leno into the far corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United should have had a second in stoppage time when Garnacho somehow skewed wide with an open goal to aim at from Marcus Rashford's unselfish pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But United held on to give Ten Hag the winning start he badly needed. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

    'Raygun' hits back at critics of her Olympic routine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael Gunn said the backlash to her much-ridiculed Olympic performance has been “devastating,” adding she took the competition seriously and gave her best effort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 36-year-old b-girl, known as "Raygun", said in a video posted to social media that she wasn’t prepared for the level of negative attention she has received since judges awarded her zero points in her Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) criticised an anonymous online petition attacking the Paris Games competitor, saying it was “vexatious, misleading and bullying.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympic debut in Paris, and one of the lasting images was the performance of Gunn, a 36-year-old university professor from Sydney — who did a “kangaroo dance” among other questionable moves during her routine — and did not receive a single point from any of the nine judges in either round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn was subsequently mocked for her efforts, including a parody on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” in the United States. In the video, she said she was subjected to abuse that went beyond criticism of her dance moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’d really like to ask the press to please stop harassing my family, my friends, the Australian breaking community and the broader street dance community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunn, who has not yet returned to Australia, received strong support from Australian Olympic team leader Anna Meares while in Paris. On Thursday, the AOC went a step further, taking aim at what it called erroneous material published online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief executive officer Matt Carroll said the the AOC had written to Change.org, which had published a petition criticising Gunn and the AOC, demanding that it be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 people had signed the petition claiming Gunn had “manipulated” Olympic qualification processes. The petition appeared to have been removed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carroll said the petition “contained numerous falsehoods designed to engender hatred against an athlete who was selected in the Australian Olympic team through a transparent and independent qualification event and nomination process.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Breaking at the Olympics might have been one-and-done in Paris. The sport is not on the competition list for Los Angeles in 2028, and also is unlikely to appear in 2032 at Brisbane, Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online criticism of Gunn this past week has included suggestions the Oceania qualifying event held in Sydney last October was set up to favour her, and questioned the judging that allowed Gunn to qualify .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AOC said Thursday the Oceania qualifying event was conducted under the Olympic qualification system determined by the international governing body, the World DanceSport Federation, and approved by International Olympic Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unattributed social media comments also suggested Gunn and her husband, fellow breaker Samuel Free, had held positions within Australian breaking organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Rachael Gunn holds no position with AUSBreaking or DanceSport Australia in any capacity,” the AOC said Thursday. “She is simply an athlete who competed in the qualifying event which she won.” (AP)

 Hungary's Blanka Vas won the fifth stage of the Tour de France Femmes on Thursday with Dutch teammate Demi Vollering losing the race lead after being caught up in a big crash.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma finished second to take the leader's yellow jersey from defending champion Vollering who dropped to ninth overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A pile-up with six kilometres to go involving 10 riders including Vollering decimated the peloton in the run to Amneville in northeastern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Team SD Worx leader now trails 1min 19sec behind her main rival Niewiadoma, who had started the stage 34 seconds behind Vollering. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mauricio Pochettino has reportedly agreed terms to become the new coach of the United States national team, according to multiple reports on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Athletic and ESPN reported that unnamed sources confirmed Pochettino, who parted ways with English Premier League side Chelsea in May, would replace Gregg Berhalter as boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino, 52, would arrive as the United States prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino left Chelsea after finishing sixth in the Premier League in his only season in charge, after previous stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports said the deal was struck after multiple conversations with US Soccer Federation technical director Matt Crocker, and that no contract has been signed nor has the federation's board of directors agreed a deal with Pochettino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentinian cannot sign a contract with US Soccer until a pay situation with Chelsea is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pochettino would be expected to take over the US squad in time for a friendly against Canada on September 7 at Kansas City. (AFP)

 Second-ranked defending champion Coco Gauff crashed out in her opening match at the WTA and ATP Cincinnati Open, falling to Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The second-round shock to America's Paris Olympic flag-bearer stunned a partisan crowd in the US heartland in the final major tuneup for the US Open on August 26, where Gauff is defending champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva, ranked 34th, has made a recent habit of upsets, knocking off world number one Iga Swiatek in the Wimbledon third round barely a month ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really proud of myself," said Putintseva. "Even if the crowd was cheering for Coco, they were fair with me. "These courts are so fast, you have to just play on instinct. That's what I did."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gauff became the youngest winner at Cincinnati a year ago at age 19 and carried that success into her first Grand Slam triumph at the US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putintseva will next face Spain's Paula Badosa, who defeated Anna Kalinsyaka 6-3, 6-2. (AFP)

 Rookie road rider Puck Pieterse clung on to win stage four of the Tour de France Femmes in Liege on Wednesday, with compatriot Demi Vollering taking second in a photo finish to conserve the yellow jersey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the first-ever road race victory for the 22-year-old cross-discipline star Pieterse at her first Tour de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result lifted the Dutch rider to second overall, and gave her the best young rider's white jersey and the polka dot climb jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To take the win here, in a sprint ahead of Demi, it's really a dream coming true," said Pieterse. "They were riding for the general classification. I'm just here for the stage. I'm fresh. I just tried to keep a poker face and take it from the sprint."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering, meanwhile, held onto the leader's yellow jersey she pulled on after Tuesday's time-trial in Rotterdam. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé enjoyed a "great night" as he struck on his Real Madrid debut to help his new side claim a record sixth Uefa Super Cup with a 2-0 win over Atalanta on Wednesday in Warsaw.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The superstar French forward has waited years to play for his dream club and after finally signing for Los Blancos this summer at the end of his Paris Saint-Germain deal, celebrated his first appearance with a goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fede Valverde broke the deadlock from close range for the Champions League holders in the 59th minute after the Italian Europa League winners held their own in the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid began to rack up the chances and Mbappé rifled home in the 68th minute after Jude Bellingham spotted his dart into space in the box to seal the victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a great night, I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, to play with this shirt, with this badge, for these fans," Mbappé said, speaking in fluent Spanish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Madrid's triumph ensured coach Carlo Ancelotti equalled former Los Blancos coach Miguel Munoz on a joint-record 14 titles won at the helm of the club.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of the SAR's Olympians have mixed views over the remuneration local athletes receive, with some saying a better package would certainly help, while others said Hongkongers already receive good support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Entry level full-time athletes can get around HK$7,000 a month in sponsorship from the Sports Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing a recent call from badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu, fencer Cedric Ho said more support would certainly help, noting that plenty of athletes have to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As someone who had been there myself, back in the day I would need to save money sometimes," he said on Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I did was I was extremely thrifty, I don't go out for a meal and force myself to eat whatever at the institute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, sailor Nicholas Halliday said Hong Kong athletes already do quite well compared to some overseas counterparts, calling the pay packages "reasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the airport, after competing at the Paris Olympics, another sailor, Russell Aylsworth, agreed, saying they "owe it all" to the institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the Hong Kong Sports Institute has given Nic and I and my sailing partner Akira Sakai tremendous support, they've been very, very helpful. Without them, I wouldn't be able to call myself an Olympian for sure," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just want to thank everyone in Hong Kong for supporting and watching the both of us sail, I just want to inspire the youth, and for all the other sailors coming up, just to continue to train hard and push hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Halliday and Ho said they plan to qualify for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for now, Halliday said he's looking forward to having some down time and enjoying some Hong Kong food favourites like cheung fun.

 Defending champion Demi Vollering won Tuesday's 6.3km time trial through the streets of Rotterdam to take over the lead after three stages of the women's Tour de France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fellow Dutchwoman Charlotte Kool made it two wins from two stages on home soil in the morning, before Vollering clocked the fastest time in the second part of a Tuesday double-header to grab the yellow jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vollering powered around the course in 7min 25sec to finish ahead of Olympic time-trial bronze medallist Chloe Dygert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very surprised that I managed to win this time trial. Even with a difference of five seconds. I have no idea how that's possible," said Vollering.

 Kylian Mbappé appears ready to make his debut for Real Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup against Atalanta on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the France striker arrived in good shape following the European Championship and was adapting well to the team after a week of practice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mbappé “could play tomorrow,” Ancelotti said Tuesday at a news conference at the National Stadium in Warsaw where the match will be played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé is the biggest draw in the Polish capital after finally joining Madrid following a drawn-out saga with his former club, Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was introduced to the club’s fans at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium last month,  but wasn’t part of the squad on its U.S. tour while he rested after Euro 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He joins a slew of world-class forwards at Madrid, including Vinícius Júnior, another new signing in Brazil striker Endrick, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo and Arda Guler. (AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a torn hamstring and will miss the Test series against Sri Lanka, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Tuesday.

  <br/>
  "England Men's Test Captain Ben Stokes has been ruled out for the rest of the summer after tearing his left hamstring while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred on Sunday," said an ECB statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former England batsman Graham Thorpe died after being struck by a train at a railway station, an inquest into his death heard on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 55-year-old took his own life, his wife Amanda revealed on Monday in an interview with The Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe died on the morning of August 4 having suffered "traumatic injuries" during the incident at Esher railway station, southwest of London, Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area coroner for Surrey, Simon Wickens, recorded Thorpe's cause of death as one of multiple injuries during the short hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coroner offered his "sincere condolences" not just to Thorpe's family, but to "all those touched by his life and career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A date for the full inquest will be fixed at a later time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's death plunged the cricket world into mourning for the popular star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoyed an impressive England career as an elegant batsman from 1993 to 2005, before spending 12 years in various coaching roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Thorpe was hospitalised in May 2022 and declared "seriously ill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe told The Times that the former Surrey batsman attempted suicide two years ago before taking his own life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite having a wife and two daughters whom he loved and who loved him, he did not get better. He was so unwell in recent times and he really did believe that we would be better off without him and we are devastated that he acted on that and took his own life," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amanda Thorpe added: "Graham was renowned as someone who was very mentally strong on the field and he was in good physical health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But mental illness is a real disease and can affect anyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thorpe's daughter Kitty, 22, said the family "are not ashamed" of talking about his death, adding: "There is nothing to hide and it is not a stigma."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-hander featured in 100 Test matches and 82 one-day internationals for England, scoring over 9,000 runs for his country, including 16 Test hundreds. (AFP)

 Dutch rider Charlotte Kool kept her head amid a chaotic bunched sprint finish to win the first stage of the women's Tour de France on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It was really hectic but I like it. I kept on thinking 'I like hectic, I like chaos'," said the 25-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I went so early and I thought it's too long and it hurt so bad but it was enough in the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kool, born in North Holland, took the yellow jersey on home soil as the women's Tour got underway in the Netherlands with a 123-kilometre flat ride from Rotterdam to The Hague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Topping 60kmh as she crossed the line, the Team DSM-Firmenich PostNL rider claimed her maiden Tour win with an unstoppable surge in the last 100 metres to complete the stage in a time of two hours 47 minutes and 40 seconds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Atletico Madrid signed striker Julian Alvarez from Manchester City on Monday in a deal reported to be worth up to 85 million euros (US$93 million).
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The club has reached an agreement with Manchester City for the transfer of the Argentine forward, who has signed a contract for the next six seasons," said Atletico in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish reports say Atletico will pay 75 million euros for the forward, with potentially 10 million more in bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old arrived at City for just £14 million (16 million euros) in January 2022 from River Plate, winning two Premier League trophies and the Champions League among other silverware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez also helped Argentina lift the World Cup trophy in December 2022 and the Copa America in 2021 and 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I say goodbye to this amazing club, with a lot of emotion," Alvarez told City's club website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These have been two very special years. During this time, I have grown and learnt a lot – both as a player and as a person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez scored 36 goals for City in 103 appearances across all competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's incredibly loved by the team for his behaviour but like I said many times for many players, he wants to leave and have a new challenge," said Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diego Simeone's Atletico have also signed Robin Le Normand and Alexander Sorloth as they reinforce heavily to compete with Real Madrid and Barcelona, following a disappointing fourth-place La Liga finish last season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Atletico begin the new campaign with a visit to face Villarreal on August 19. (AFP)

    Ex-Olympic diving champion Tom Daley retires
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tom Daley, (right), who won silver in Paris with Noah Williams, says he now wants to spend time with his husband and two children. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765919_1_20240812232925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Olympic gold medallist Tom Daley said on Monday it was the "right time" to retire as Britain's most successful diver walked away from the sport following the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Daley, who won five Olympic medals during his decorated career, revealed the decision to call time on the sport during an interview with British Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old bowed out after winning silver in the Olympic men's synchronised 10m platform in France, having clinched the gold medal in the same event at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to make the decision at some point, and it feels like the right time. It's the right time to call it a day," Daley said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley emerged as the star of British diving after first competing at the Olympics in the 2008 Beijing Games aged just 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He won bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London in the 10m platform, as well as bronze in the men's synchronised 10m platform in Rio 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley had effectively retired after his gold medal success in Tokyo, before deciding to return for a fifth Olympics in Paris in order to compete in front of his two children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He decided ahead of the event that he would stop diving competitively once he stepped out of the pool in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels very, very surreal. I felt so incredibly nervous going into this, knowing it was my last Olympics," he told Vogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was a lot of pressure and expectations. I was eager for it to be done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But when I walked out, and saw my husband (Lance) and kids (Robbie and Phoenix) and my friends and family in the audience, I was like, you know what? This is exactly why I did this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was emotional at the end, up there on the platform, knowing it was going to be my last competitive dive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley's gold in Tokyo came alongside Matty Lee and he was back to defend his title in Paris after being convinced by his six-year-old son Robbie to return to the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daley and partner Noah Williams claimed silver in the competition, finishing behind China a fortnight ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking forward to spending more time with his family away from the Olympic spotlight, Daley has no fears he will regret retiring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to be with my family. I'm really excited to be able to spend some time with them and just be able to feel a bit normal for a couple of days," said Daley, who fulfilled a childhood dream by becoming the first diver to be a British flag bearer in the Olympic opening ceremony in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's always hard when you say goodbye to your sport. Lots of things to process, but I think it's the right time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year felt like such a bonus and I got to compete in front of my family, my kids. I got to be a flag bearer. So yeah, bucket list ticked off on every occasion." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Just opposite the fencing stadium, the Grand Palais on the Avenue des Champs Élysées, scores of tourists have been queuing up outside the largest Olympic merchandise store to take home a taste of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paris 2024 megastore offers a variety of souvenirs, from 5 euro pens and bracelets, to giant mascots costing 800 euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekday visitors have had to wait around 15 minutes to get inside the store, but most RTHK spoke to said it was worth queuing up for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adam, a UK tourist in Paris with his kids, bought a T-shirt, a hat, a poster and some badges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We spent about 110 euros, which I think, as it's only every four years, it's something to remember the Games by, so I think it's okay every once in a while,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic mascot “Phryge”, a little red hat symbolising French liberty, is one of the bestsellers at the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas from Hong Kong bought one because he wanted something special to take home with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s unique and it's like representing the culture and France and also it represents the spirit of the Olympics, so we're trying to look for something very unique for a gift,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to the French capital can also take home the smell of a fresh baguette, with the launch of scratch-and-sniff stamps by the French postal service La Poste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's to celebrate the baguette, which is one of the symbols of France for the tourists for them to enjoy and to share this with the people they live with abroad,” said Gaspard, a worker at the Olympic Village’s post office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French baguette was given Unesco heritage status in 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell on Sunday became the first LIV Golf player to be suspended under its anti-doping policy for using an over-the-counter decongestant that contained a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2010 US Open champion used a decongestant at LIV's June event in Nashville that contained the banned substance levo-methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDowell posted on social media that he was struggling with severe congestion that affected his sleep prior to the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saudi-funded league said McDowell would be suspended for one tournament and fined US$125,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will be replaced in the field at the LIV Golf Greenbrier next week by an alternate. (AFP/AP)

 England captain Ben Stokes was helped off the field after suffering an injury while playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred domestic cricket competition on Sunday, raising concerns he could miss the upcoming test series against Sri Lanka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 33-year-old Stokes pulled up while running between the wickets as the Superchargers chased a victory target of 153 against Manchester Originals at Old Trafford. Stokes appeared to clutch his left hamstring as he was completing a quick single from the non-striker’s end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes, who had bowled 15 overs in the match, retired hurt on two runs with England teammate Harry Brook coming out to replace him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stokes led England to a 3-0 series sweep against West Indies last month. England opens its test series against Sri Lanka next Wednesday at Old Trafford, with the third and final test at the Oval from September 6. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris said a triumphant "au revoir" to the Olympics on Sunday as the curtain came down on its widely praised staging of the global sporting spectacular.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A star-studded closing ceremony took place in front of around 71,500 spectators at the Stade de France to crown an event that has been broadly acclaimed as one of the greatest editions of the Olympics ever held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 270 artists performed in the packed arena for an estimated 9,000 athletes who marched into the venue as the festivities got into full swing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening segment of the ceremony festivities began with France's swimming hero Leon Marchand -- winner of four gold medals at these Games -- gathering the Olympic flame from the cauldron in the centre of Paris to begin its journey to the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rugby hero Antoine Dupont -- who led the host nation to a rugby sevens gold medal in one of the early highlights of the Games -- carried a tricolore flag into the Stade de France as partying athletes swarmed the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show included a theatrical sequence entitled "Records", which was a dream-like immersive journey through time, led by a "Golden Voyager".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musicians Phoenix then entertained the crowd with a series of hits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach hailed the Paris Games as "sensational".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish - or dare I say, Seine-sational Games," Bach said in a speech at the closing ceremony, in a reference to the river which staged the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the Los Angeles Olympics, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed to the Californian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then it was time for Hollywood's top gun Tom Cruise to jump from the roof of the Stade de France into the closing ceremony before speeding off with the Olympic flag in a dramatic handover that began the anticipation for the Games in 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A beaming Cruise high-fived athletes after making the roughly 160-foot descent before jumping on a motorcycle and exiting the stadium as the crowd at the 80,000-seat stadium roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Living up to the stunning success of the Paris Games may seem like mission impossible for LA and the celebrity-rich city will lean on its stars such as leading man Cruise as the Olympic spotlight turns to Southern California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise was among the many celebrities seen taking in the action at the Paris Games, showing up at gymnastics, swimming and soccer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, Yseult, a French R&B singer, performed "Comme d’habitude," the song famously adapted into "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lights dimmed as she serenaded the stadium before fireworks lit up the sky to conclude Paris 2024. (Agencies)

 A dazzling festival of sport in Paris officially ended on Day 16 as the 2024 Olympics concluded with a spectacular closing ceremony. The baton has been passed to Los Angeles, which hosts the Games in 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US edged out France in the last event of the day in women's basketball to claim their 40th gold medal in Paris. China also won a 40th gold in women's weightlifting, but the Americans end the Games ahead of the national team due to the fact they won 44 silvers compared with China's 27. Japan finished third while hosts France were fifth. Still, China's 40 golds is its second highest ever after the Beijing Olympics of 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong China's Ceci Lee was bidding for a medal in the women's omnium, but it wasn't to be. The SAR finished 37th in the table with two gold and two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here are some of the highlights on the last day of the Olympic Games in Paris.

       The United States held off France 67-66 to win an unprecedented eighth successive women's Olympic basketball gold on Sunday and extend their run of victories at the tournament to 61 games.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A'ja Wilson scored a game-high 21 points for the Americans who won the title for the 10th time overall, surviving a buzzer-beating shot from France's Gabby Williams.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The hosts needed a three to force overtime but Williams' foot was on three-point line as she let go off the ball, so her shot counted for just two points in a dramatic finale.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian gymnast Ana Barbosu will be awarded the Olympic floor exercise bronze medal, after it was taken away from her following an appeal from the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Olympic Committee made the announcement on Sunday, one day after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the request by the American team to re-evaluate Jordan Chiles' score was lodged four seconds after the one-minute deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review, which went ahead at the time, upgraded Chiles to bronze from fifth, behind Brazil's winner Rebeca Andrade and fellow US gymnast Simone Biles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was a devastating blow for Barbosu, who thought she had bagged bronze and was already celebrating with the Romanian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can barely express my emotions, I can't believe it," Barbosu said after learning she was awarded her country's only gymnastics medal in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I heard the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A devastated Chiles took to Instagram, posting four broken hearts, adding: "I am taking this time and removing myself from social media for my mental health thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who trains with Chiles, and won team gold with her in Paris, added: "Sending you so much love Jordan. Keep your chin up Olympic champ! We love you!" (Additional reporting by AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee says every athlete's efforts have made all Hongkongers proud. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765780_1_20240811233819.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday congratulated the SAR's athletes for their achievements at the Paris Olympics, noting it was the first time that Team Hong Kong, China had won more than one gold medal at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Golds from foil fencer Edgar Cheung and épée fencer Vivian Kong, as well as two swimming bronzes from Siobhan Haughey, put the SAR 37th in the medals table, which is the city's highest ever ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Hong Kong athlete has given their utmost and unleashed their full potential in the Olympic arena. In spite of the results, all athletes have fully exhibited their determination, perseverance and will, demonstrating their professional attitude and sportsmanship," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people of Hong Kong and I are deeply inspired and moved. The people of Hong Kong are proud of the high level of performance shown by Hong Kong athletes, and each and every one of them is a hero in our hearts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the government would provide more sporting facilities, such as converting an existing sports centre into a dedicated fencing venue, and speeding up a study on building a fencing arena and a swimming pool which can host international competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the current financial year, the administration had provided more than HK$940 million in funding to the Sports Institute through the Elite Athletes Development Fund, around a 40 percent increase from five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said with the Paris Paralympic Games later this month and Hong Kong co-hosting the National Games next year, he's confident that society would continue to support the SAR's athletes to shine and "demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Hong Kong".
