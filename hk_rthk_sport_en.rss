<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong on Sunday won gold in the men's table tennis singles at the Paris Olympics, beating his Swedish opponent 4-1 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who won silver at the Tokyo Games three years ago, fell behind early, with Sweden's Truls Moregard winning the opening game 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the second-seeded from China came roaring back, winning the next four games to clinch victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan took the second and third games 11-9 and the fourth game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fifth game, the 27-year-old Fan raced to a big 10-3 lead before Moregard saved five match points to make it 10-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan managed to secure the next point to win the game and his first Olympics singles title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to compatriot Ma Long in the final of the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is also China's 17th gold medal at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moregard, ranked 26th in the world, upset the Chinese top seed Wang Chuqin in the round of 32 en route to the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Lebrun from France, who was beaten by Fan in the semi-finals, claimed bronze after defeating his Brazilian opponent, Hugo Calderano.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italian rider Enea Bastianini completed the British MotoGP double for Ducati on Sunday by winning the grand prix, while Jorge Martin of Spain reclaimed the championship lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bastianini added to his sprint win on Saturday by racing past Martin inside the last two laps to claim victory, while the Spaniard finished second to move back above third-placed Francesco Bagnaia in the overall riders' championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ducati-Pramac's Martin arrived at Silverstone 10 points behind Bagnaia, who won the last four grand prix, but second-placed finishes in the sprint and grand prix meant he leapfrogged the Italian back into the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a weekend to forget for Bagnaia after he crashed out of the sprint and then ceded the early lead in the grand prix race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his compatriot Bastianini will have fond memories of Silverstone 2024 after producing a stunning late run to sprint to the double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bagnaia sprang into the lead from the start but was eventually reeled in on lap 14 by Martin, who had started on the second row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bastianini soon caught up with the two pacesetters and, after going past Bagnaia, he made his move on turn three of the 19th lap to fly ahead of Martin and sprint towards the chequered flag. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's He Bingjiao on Sunday booked a place in the women's badminton singles final at the Paris Olympics after her semi-final opponent withdrew because of injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Spain's Carolina Marin, who won gold in the 2016 Rio Games, started off strong against the Chinese shuttler, taking the first game 21-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marin was leading 10-6 in the second when she appeared to have injured her right knee and collapsed to the floor in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She put on a knee brace and played two more points before deciding to retire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard limped off the court to a standing ovation from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her Chinese opponent told reporters that she felt very sad about what had happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was playing perfectly well and I was very passive," said He. "I wasn't thinking about the final at all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He advanced to the final to play world number one, An Seyoung from South Korea, who beat Indonesia's Gregoria Mariska Tunjung in the other semis. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Vivian Kong bids farewell to fencing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vivian Kong says she’s going to start a charity to help kids pursue sports. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764658_1_20240804101145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong has announced her retirement from professional fencing, bidding farewell to her career as a full-time athlete.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made history at the Paris Olympics Games, clinching the first ever gold medal in the individual epee event for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old’s résumé includes three Olympic appearances, two world championship bronze medals, as well as six Asian Games medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m so grateful to have had the chance to dedicate almost 20 years of my life to fencing and thank you for being a part of this journey,” she wrote in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After competing in my third Olympics, I have decided to take a break from professional fencing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she’s going to start a new career and launch her own charity to help kids find joy and playfulness in sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I will miss my fencing family so so much, but once a fencer, always a fencer,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, said Kong had informed him of her decision earlier, saying he understood it but was sad to hear the news.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe the decision was made after long-time consideration and family discussions. I wasn't surprised when she told me about the decision,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “She is such a high performance athlete who has just won an Olympic gold medal and is at the peak of her athletic career. This is something many athletes can only dream of… I’m really sad to see her go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng said that Kong’s departure will definitely have an impact on the fencing team, but added that he remains optimistic about the team's future development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patrick Yung, a surgeon who performed two knee operations on Kong, said he is behind the Olympic gold medallist's decision to hang up her sword.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong suffered serious anterior cruciate ligament injuries in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think those injuries suffered by Vivian over the past years did affect her decision for retirement or not," Yung, who chairs the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology at Chinese University, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But over the past few years, it's not just physical demands, [there's] also very high mental stress for a lot of Olympians representing Hong Kong. That's why I am not surprised to see not just Vivian, but even others, would like to take a break, [go on] holiday, or do something else, so that they can recover physically and mentally."

   Chinese tennis star Zheng Qinwen has claimed the biggest victory of her budding career, clinching a gold medal on her Olympic debut by defeating Croatian veteran Donna Vekic in the women's final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sixth-seeded Zheng made a name for herself after upsetting world number one Iga Swiatek in the last four. The 21-year-old carried that momentum into the showdown at Roland Garros, leading Vekic from wire to wire for the 6-2, 6-3 victory.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Femke Bol ran a stunning last lap to lead the Netherlands to victory in the Olympic 4x400 metres mixed relay on Saturday, glorious redemption for the 24-year-old who fell just before the line in the same race at last year's world championships.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bol got the baton in fourth place, around 20 metres behind the leading Americans, but ate up the ground in a spectacular 47.93-second leg before passing American Kaylyn Brown just before the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch team of Eugene Omalla, Lieke Klaver, Isaya Klein Ikkink and Bol clocked three minutes 7.43 seconds, missing the world record time the Americans set in Friday's heats by just two-hundredths of a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Julien Alfred delivered a brilliant gun-to-tape performance to win the women’s 100 metres final and claim Saint Lucia’s first-ever Olympic medal, though the controversial absence of Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce left a cloud over the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alfred made her usual slick start and remained clear in heavy rain on a sodden track to come home in a national record 10.72 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion and race favourite Sha'Carri Richardson took silver in 10.87 but the American never really threatened and her compatriot Melissa Jefferson claimed bronze in 10.92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Double Olympic champion Fraser-Pryce, appearing in her fifth Olympics, was listed as 'Did Not Start' shortly before the semi-finals and her lane remained empty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social media footage later emerged of her and Jamaican team members arguing with officials who appeared to be refusing to let her in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fraser-Pryce was heard saying "they've changed the rules, we always come through this gate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World Athletics said it was still awaiting official confirmation of the reason for her absence from the Jamaican team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norway's Markus Rooth captured a shock gold medal in the men's decathlon after defending champion Damian Warner's title defence ended when he failed to clear a height in the pole vault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Thea LaFond made history for her Caribbean island nation of Dominica by winning gold in the triple jump to claim the country's first ever Olympic medal.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Katie Ledecky won a record-equalling career ninth gold medal at the Paris Olympics by claiming an unprecedented fourth women's 800 metres freestyle title on Saturday, while Team China added a relay silver to their collection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American great touched the wall in 8:11.04 at La Defense Arena, 1.25 seconds ahead of Australian silver medallist Ariarne Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paige Madden took bronze for the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ledecky's ninth gold from four Games gives her a share of the all-time record for female Olympians with former Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also joined fellow American great Michael Phelps as the only swimmer to win four Olympic golds in the same event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States won the mixed 4x100 metres medley relay gold with a world record time, as France's Leon Marchand suffered his first defeat in a final at the meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China took the silver and Australia the bronze. France, with four-gold hero Marchand swimming the second leg, finished fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winning time of three minutes 37.43 seconds smashed the record of 3:37.58 set by previous champions Britain at the 2021 Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Canada's Summer McIntosh won the women's 200 metres individual medley in an Olympic record time for her third swimming gold of the Games and fourth medal overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kate Douglass of the United States won the silver and Australian Kaylee McKeown the bronze after US swimmer Alex Walsh was disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gold completed a medley double for the 17-year-old McIntosh, who won the 400 IM last Monday. She also won the 200 butterfly on Thursday and took silver in the 400 freestyle on the opening Saturday. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tennis star Zheng Qinwen has claimed the biggest victory of her budding career, clinching a gold medal on her Olympic debut by defeating Croatian veteran Donna Vekic in the women's final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sixth-seeded Zheng made a name for herself after upsetting world number one Iga Swiatek in the last four on Thursday. The 21-year-old carried that momentum into the showdown at Roland Garros, leading Vekic from wire to wire for the 6-2, 6-3 victory in one hour and 45 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After converting on her first match point, China's top woman dropped to the ground and punched her fists in the air as a large Chinese contingent in the stands erupted in cheers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng is the first Chinese woman to win an Olympic singles gold, and to achieve the feat on her debut made it all the more special.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compatriots Li Ting and Sun Tiantian also struck gold in 2004 in the women's doubles, while Yan Zi and Zheng Jie took home bronze at the same event four years later in Beijing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgium's Remco Evenepoel made history on Saturday in the men's cycling road race, though Hong Kong's Vincent Lau dropped out almost three-quarters of the way through one of the most gruelling of all Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel, who won the time trial a week earlier, became the first man to claim gold in both road cycling disciplines, despite having to swap bikes four kilometres from the finish because of a mechanical failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He took control 15 kilometres from the end of the 273km race around Paris and surrounding areas to cross the finish line near the Eiffel Tower one minute and 11 seconds ahead of Valentin Madouas of France. Another home athlete, Christophe Laporte, completed the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau pushed hard and cycled beyond the 200-kilometre mark, but he unfortunately couldn’t keep up with the peloton, becoming one of 13 participants who failed to complete the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was disappointed he could not reach the finishing line, but he was excited to have raced alongside some all-time greats of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Performance-wise, I think I could do better. But the experience, I think, it's the best you can get. A cycling race in France, it doesn't get bigger than this," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seeing all the fans on every climb, shouting 'allez, allez, allez', it's every cyclist's dream to have that crowd on a climb cheering you on. I think the experience is very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 90 cyclists in the pack had to overcome 2,800 metres of climbing on 13 ascents throughout the course, which passed many Parisian landmarks before winding into the French countryside.

    Rangers held by Hearts on opening day of SPL season

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rangers were forced to settle for a disappointing 0-0 draw against Hearts in the opening game of the new Scottish Premiership season on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With Scottish champions Celtic starting their title defence at home to Kilmarnock on Sunday, Rangers had an opportunity to issue a statement of intent to their title rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Philippe Clement's side produced an erratic display at Tynecastle characterised by poor finishing and a lack of cohesion in midfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was exactly the kind of concerning display Rangers fans had feared after Clement sounded a warning on the eve of Rangers' latest bid to win their first title since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belgian took over from Michael Beale last October and sparked an upturn in form that included a League Cup triumph and briefly brought them back into title contention before Celtic pulled away in the closing stages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just 24 hours after agreeing to extend his contract until 2028, Clement hardly inspired confidence when he admitted before kick-off that his squad was "probably not stronger" than last season and might need several months to get up to speed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rangers endured a difficult close-season marred by unconvincing friendly performances, debatable transfer activity and construction delays that meant their renovated Ibrox stadium was not available for the start of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Clement's cautious tone appeared prophetic as Rangers struggled to keep Hearts at bay in a frantic start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland striker Lawrence Shankland, who scored 24 league goals last season, started for Hearts amid speculation over a potential move to Rangers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shankland took just 60 seconds to underline his quality with a stinging strike that forced a good stop from Jack Butland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Rangers goalkeeper was called into action again moments later to repel James Penrice's strike after a slick move carved open the visitors' defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rangers were on the ropes and Yan Dhanda's curler ricocheted off the crossbar as Hearts pressure mounted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor Barron made his Rangers debut after joining from Aberdeen, but Robin Propper, who signed from FC Twente on Thursday, was denied his Rangers debut due to paperwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barron was inches away from putting Rangers ahead against the run of play but the midfielder's low drive was clawed to safety by Zander Clark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyriel Dessers squandered an even better chance for Rangers when the striker scooped over from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hearts were just as profligate as Barrie McKay blazed over from Dhanda's defence-splitting pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dhanda appealed in vain for a penalty after his cross hit Barron on the hand, but Rangers finally had some momentum and Clark saved well from Dessers just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dessers missed another golden opportunity early in the second half, the striker's luck completely out as he hit the bar from close range and watched in disbelief as the rebound cannoned off the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vaclav Cerny came off the bench for his Rangers debut after signing on loan from Wolfsburg, before Clark's superb save stopped Tom Lawrence's half-volley dipping into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Held in check for long periods by the Rangers defence, Shankland managed to wriggle clear for a near-post effort that Butland parried away, but neither side could find a winner.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Simone Biles won the vault final on Saturday to clinch her third gold medal of the Paris Games, dominating the competition with her signature Biles II vault to beat Brazilian silver medallist Rebeca Andrade with American Jade Carey taking bronze.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biles soared high into the air as she performed her explosive Yurchenko double pike for a massive score of 15.700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American also impressed with her second effort. She powered down the runway and launched into the Cheng vault, which incorporates a round-off, half-on entry with a one-and-a-half twisting flip to finish. She earned 14.900.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old claimed a comfortable victory at the Bercy Arena with an average of 15.300 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles arrived in Paris as the world's most decorated gymnast and she has reached new heights by claiming gold medals in all three women's events contested so far in Paris. She now has 10 Olympic medals overall, with seven of them being gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She led the US team to the top of the podium in the team final before claiming a second all-around Olympic title two days ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles can add to her tally further when she competes in the balance beam and women's floor finals on Monday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's badminton pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan on Saturday won an Olympic gold in Paris, defeating compatriots Liu Shenshu and Tan Ning in straight games for the women's doubles title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu and Tan – the third seed at the Paris Games – took a 20-17 lead in the first game, but the top seeded Chen and Jia saved four game points to win 22-20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensing that their opponents' confidence was wavering, Chen and Jia rushed to a 9-2 edge to start the second game, before leading 11-7 at intermission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu and Tan then cut the deficit to bring the score to 11-13, but that was the closest they managed to get, as the top shuttlers won the second game 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was China's first gold in the women's doubles since 2012, and sixth since the event became a fixture at the Olympics in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia had previously come up short in Tokyo, finishing second on the podium after losing to Indonesians Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's table tennis player Chen Meng on Saturday put herself in the record books with an emphatic 4-2 victory against compatriot Sun Yingsha in Paris, becoming the third person to defend an Olympic women's singles crown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The all-China matchup was a repeat of the Tokyo Games, when Chen also defeated Sun by the same margin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's final was an intense affair, with top-seed Sun starting off well – winning the first game 11-4 – before second-seeded Chen won the next two, 11-7, 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determined not to go down 1-3, Sun scored five straight points in game four to break a 5-5 tie and eventually wrapped up the game 11-9 to tie the score at two games apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the pivotal game five, the score was tied multiple times, with Chen eventually breaking the deadlock at 9-9 to win 11-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She went on to take the final game 11-6 to seal the win, following in the footsteps of ping pong greats Deng Yaping and Zhang Yining, who had successfully defended their Olympic singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the sport was introduced to the Olympics in 1988, China has won all 10 gold medals in the women's singles.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR sailor Nicholas Halliday on Saturday improved his overall ranking in the men's dinghy, going up by three places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old completed two more races – coming in 6th place in the second one – on the third day of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday has four more races to go over the next two days in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is now ranked 25th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 89 net points, compared with 63 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China, women's swimmers on Saturday finished their 4x100 metres medley relay ranked 13th out of 14 teams, saying they all very much enjoyed their last race at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephanie Au, Siobhan Haughey, Natalie Kan and Karen Tam clocked a time of four minutes and 3.56 seconds, nearly two seconds short of the Hong Kong record the four hold, and more than a second slower than their Paris entry time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au, competing in her fifth Olympics, had a strong start, as she helped the team stay in the middle of the pack in the backstroke leg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when Haughey finished off her breaststroke leg, the SAR squad was among the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kan and Tam tried to catch up in butterfly and freestyle, but to no avail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They ended up being seventh in their heat, with Denmark being disqualified. Team Australia won the heat and were the fastest entering the finals, with Team China second in the heat and third overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au described their finishing time as less than ideal, but the swimmer said she was thankful for the experience because she had many family and friends in the stands cheering for her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said she was pleased with her overall performance in Paris, saying she very much enjoyed being with her fellow relay swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think when you evaluate a competition, you don't just look at the results because there are a lot of details behind it. You don't just determine [a competition] with the time and rank," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kan, making her Olympic debut, said while their time fell short of expectations, she had no regrets because she knew the whole team already did the best they could.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam said everyone enjoyed the experience and thanked the Hongkongers in the stands who travelled all the way to Paris to support them.

    HK sprinter Felix Diu unable to advance in 100m

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Felix Diu (C) was very close to advancing to the next round. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764597_2_20240803222636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu was on Saturday eliminated in the preliminary round of the men’s 100m race, finishing fourth in his heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He was unable to establish a new SAR record with a time of 10.62 seconds, just 0.02 seconds short of coming in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Noa Jerrel Bibi of Mauritius came first in the heat with a time of 10.27 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu's time was 0.34 seconds short of the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top two in each heat and the four fastest runners from the rest of the pack can advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100-metre specialist entered the Olympics through a wild card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic qualification for the 100m dash is 10 seconds and Diu’s personal best, which is also his best time this year, is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the race, Diu expressed disappointment with his performance, saying he had been dealing with a leg injury, and that has affected his training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, my condition wasn't as good as it was when I clocked a 10.33, so perhaps I will just work harder next time, and in competitions next year," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While being the third Hong Kong sprinter in history to make it to the 100m race at the Games, the sprinter, 24, said he learnt quite a lot from his "unforgettable" Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a rather shocking and exciting experience. There are so many spectators in the stadium cheering for athletes, it's really something different."

    France win over Argentina sparks ugly scenes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The trouble flared at full-time between the now arch-rivals. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764542_1_20240803061813.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's grudge match with Argentina ended in ugly scenes after Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal to put the hosts into the Olympic semi-finals on Friday with a 1-0 win, joining Spain, Morocco and Egypt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tensions spilled over at full-time in Bordeaux with rival players and staff clashing on the pitch and confrontations continuing down the tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Palace striker Mateta struck five minutes into the quarter-final, meeting Michael Olise's corner with a superb near-post header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That proved enough for the hosts, coached by Thierry Henry, to reach the last four, where they face Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's clash was the first meeting of the nations since Argentina players were recorded singing racist chants about their French counterparts as they celebrated winning the Copa America in mid-July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifa announced it would investigate the chants, which targeted France's star striker Kylian Mbappe among others and included racist and homophobic insults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentina team were met with a hostile welcome, where the crowd loudly jeered their national anthem as the sides met for the first time since the 2022 World Cup final, which the South Americans won on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry said midfielder Enzo Millot, who had been substituted late on, was shown a red card after the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He wasn't on the pitch. Maybe you get sent off because you get a second yellow card to stop someone running through on goal, not when you are on the bench. I am really not happy about that," Henry told broadcaster France 3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giuliano Simeone and Julian Alvarez missed chances for Javier Mascherano's Argentina, and the exit of the two-time gold medallists means the winner of men's football gold will not come from Latin America for the first time since Cameroon triumphed in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France could have won by a wider margin, but Olise had a late second goal disallowed for a foul in the build-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will now be heavy favourites to win a semi-final in Lyon on Monday against Egypt, who beat Paraguay 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ibrahim Adel was Egypt's hero, scoring a late equaliser in normal time and then converting the winning penalty in the shoot-out, in which Paraguay's Marcelo Perez was the only player to fail to score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier a brilliant brace by Barcelona's Fermin Lopez helped fire Spain to a 3-0 win over Japan in Lyon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lopez, a member of Spain's triumphant Euro 2024 squad, blasted in the opener from range in the 11th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Barcelona midfielder struck again on 73 minutes with another goal of the highest quality as he controlled a Sergio Gomez corner before volleying in from the edge of the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Abel Ruiz wrapped up the win for Spain, Olympic champions in 1992 and silver medallists three years ago in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain go through to a last-four clash in Marseille with Morocco, who outclassed the United States, winning 4-0 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soufiane Rahimi opened the scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled in the box just before the half-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was a fifth goal in four games for the tournament's top scorer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morocco doubled their lead on 63 minutes when Abde Ezzalzouli set up Ilias Akhomach to finish at the near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Achraf Hakimi, playing on his Paris Saint-Germain home ground, ran through to make it 3-0 and substitute Mehdi Maouhoub added another penalty in stoppage time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we keep playing like this we will deserve to be in the final," said Akhomach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other countries might be talked about more than us but we know what we want. We came here to win." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Despite being cheered on by a passionate crowd inside Court Philippe Chatrier, Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen were denied a first tennis gold for China in two decades.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of clinching a first Olympic tennis gold medal in two decades were dashed as the nation's mixed doubles pair came up short against the Czech Republic in a thrilling final which ended at nearly midnight, Paris time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen were broken twice in the opening set, which they conceded after just 23 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after settling in, the pair were neck and neck against Katerina Siniakova and Tomas Machac. Set two lasted nearly twice as long, with Wang and Zhang taking it 7-5 in 40 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the match at one set apiece, a 10-point tiebreak ensued to decide who would be gold medallists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raucous Chinese supporters inside Court Philippe Chatrier were in a frenzy after their side went up 3-0. But the Czechs levelled the score and bagged the last four points of the match, including a crucial double fault by their opponents at 8-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dramatic slip-up meant China had to make do with a silver. It was still the first tennis medal for the nation since Zheng Jie and Yan Zi struck bronze in the women's doubles in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed a gold by Li Ting and Sun Tiantian in the same discipline in Athens four years prior.

 Joris Daudet led a French clean sweep of the podium in men's Olympic BMX racing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His compatriots Sylvain Andre and Romain Mahieu took silver and bronze in front of an ecstatic home crowd in the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines stadium, finally winning the Olympic medals that had so long eluded them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French have dominated BMX racing in recent decades, amassing 50 gold medals at world championships since 1982, and Daudet and Mahieu are first and second in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Olympics, however, they had only bagged two medals - both by female riders - since the sport's debut in Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Dutchman Niek Kimmann unable to defend his Tokyo 2021 title due to illness and Tokyo silver medalist Kye Whyte of Britain hampered by a back injury, the French dominated their semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron, the three French riders shot out of the starting ramp and maintained their lead throughout the final, zooming over the bumpy, winding course in a 1-2-3 formation like one blue-and-white streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BMX race, Saya Sakakibara of Australia won gold, Manon Veenstra of the Netherlands took silver and Zoe Claessens of Switzerland claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sakakibara and Mahieu, who are dating each other, will go home with a medal each - one gold, one bronze - at the same Games and in the same discipline. (Reuters)

 Medals for Team China and a dash of romance characterised day seven of the Paris Olympics on Friday, with success in diving and on the badminton court.

  <br/>

  Overall, China sit top of the medal table with 13 golds, ahead of France and Australia with 11 apiece.

 Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei won the men's 10,000 metres gold medal at the Paris Olympics on Friday, the first track medal of the athletics programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time world champion in the 10,000 metres made his move on the final lap and surged in the last 100 metres to cross the finish line in an Olympic record time of 26 minutes, 43.14 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Berihu Aregawi took silver and American Grant Fisher claimed the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Barely 16 years ago when I was watching the great Kenenisa Bekele win in Beijing, it was something that grew in my heart," said Cheptegei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said, 'one day I want to be Olympic champion'. It is the most special day. I can’t describe the feeling. I’ve wanted this for a long time. When I took silver in Tokyo I was so disappointed. I just wanted to win the 10,000m."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, there was an explosive start to the Olympic track and field competition at the Stade de France when the United States mixed 4x400m relay broke the world record to qualify in first place for the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quartet of Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Bryce Deadmon and Kaylyn Brown timed 3 minutes, 7.41 seconds, smashing the previous best of 3:08.80 set when the US won world gold in Budapest last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We wanted to come out here and execute good hand-offs," said Norwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We set the tone for the rest of the United States with that world record."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's decathlon, Germany's Leo Neugebauer tops the standings with 4,650 points at the half-way mark, with the second part of the competition to be held the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Dutch long-distance star Sifan Hassan launched her audacious bid for an unprecedented Olympic treble with a confident performance in the opening round of the women's 5,000 metres on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old Olympic champion is aiming to become the first woman in history to win 5,000m, 10,000m and marathon gold at the same Olympics, emulating Czech great Emil Zatopek, who achieved the men's triple at the 1952 Helsinki Games.

 China added a silver and a bronze to their haul in the men's trampoline, while reigning champion Ivan Litvinovich successfully defended his Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both Yan Langyu and 18-year-old Wang Zisai were hoping to dethrone Litvinovich, the Belarusian who competed as an "individual neutral athlete" because of his nation's involvement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, who started third in the eight-man final, briefly led the pack with a score of 61.89 while Yan was close behind in second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were judged by their routine's difficulty, execution, horizontal displacement and time of flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Litvinovich was second last to go, and he withstood pressure to win in 63.09.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leon Marchand demonstrated again on Friday why many consider him the best swimmer of his generation as he stormed to his fourth individual gold medal in the pool at La Defense Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French star took command on the backstroke leg of the men's 200m individual medley and never looked back, winning in an Olympic record time of 1 minutes, 54.06 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Duncan Scott won his second straight silver in the event while defending champion Wang Shun of China settled for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marchand is the first French athlete to take four individual golds, as opposed to team ones, at a single Summer Games and only the third male swimmer to do so after Americans Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's incredible, it was really magical," the 22-year-old told French TV. "The whole stadium was fully behind me and I took advantage of it. It enabled me to win four medals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a good night for Australia as the Dolphins came away with two more gold medals from the meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaylee McKeown cemented her place among the greats of Olympic swimming on Friday as she became the first woman to retain both of the backstroke titles with gold in the 200m event in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old world record holder once again overhauled American challenger Regan Smith in a battle royale to claim the win in an Olympic record of 2 minutes, 3.73 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith took silver, 0.53 seconds behind her Australian nemesis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kylie Masse took bronze for Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Australia's Cameron McEvoy took his first Olympic gold medal when he won the men's 50 metres freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Ben Proud took the silver medal, and France's Florent Manaudou the bronze - 12 years after he won gold at London 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Olympic champion Caeleb Dressel of the United States finished sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McEvoy is the first Australian man to win the shortest distance on the programme. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong smashed their way to a gold medal in the mixed doubles badminton event on Friday at the Paris Olympics, beating Kim Won-ho and Jeong Na-eun of South Korea in straight sets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Japanese pair of Yuta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino won the bronze medal match to complete the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After receiving her medal on the podium, Huang's boyfriend and fellow Chinese shuttler Liu Yuchen proposed to her in front of an ecstatic crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang made a commanding start with a strong attack to put them far ahead. Kim and Jeong tried their best to defend, but could not overcome the world number one duo in the first game 21-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans stepped up their efforts with more attacks in the beginning of the second game, knowing this would determine their position on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese side’s tactic to target one specific player at a time immediately put them back in the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair's powerful smash shots further widened the gap to end the game 21-11 and earn a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang lost to their Chinese counterparts at the Tokyo Olympics in the gold medal match, but this time around they were able to reach the top of the podium in just under an hour of game play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cap off her already special day, Huang's boyfriend Liu made a surprise appearance at the arena. He came prepared with an engagement ring, and presented it to Huang while on one knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will love you for my whole life. Will you marry me?" Liu asked in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overcome with joy, Huang said 'yes'.

    Row over Olympic boxing gender scandal deepens

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei in action with Sitora Turdibekova of Uzbekistan. She is one of two athletes at the centre of a brewing controversy at the Olympics over gender. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764500_1_20240802224116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The double world champion from Chinese Taipei, Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the heart of a gender row, won her featherweight round of 16 bout against Uzbekistan's Sidora Turdibekova on points by unanimous decision at the Paris Olympics on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old Lin, along with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won her round of 16 welterweight fight on Thursday against Italy's Angela Carini in 46 seconds, have been in the spotlight of the gender row after being cleared to compete in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules that prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women's events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing tournament in Paris, has cleared the boxers to compete in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IBA said in a statement the athletes "did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the "specifics" of this test "remain confidential", the IBA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the Olympic body's eligibility criteria was based on the gender indicated on the boxers' passports, but acknowledged that it's "not a black and white issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither Lin nor Khelif is known to identify as transgender and both competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 in the women's competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The row has expanded outside the ring, with politicians and celebrities weighing in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the Khelif-Carini fight was "not on an equal footing", after the Italian fighter was left with a badly hurt nose and in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US presidential candidate Donald Trump declared on his Truth Social network that he would keep "men out of women's sports".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate JD Vance described Thursday's one-sided bout between Khelif-Carini as a "grown man pummelling a woman in a boxing match", adding: "This is disgusting, and all of our leaders should condemn it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Potter author JK Rowling said on X, formerly Twitter, that the Paris Games would be "forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday maintained a steady position in the pack after two more races in the men's dinghy event, with six still to come over the next three days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ranked 28th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 65 net points, compared with 32 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz became the youngest man to reach the Olympic Games men's tennis final on Friday when he thrashed Felix Auger-Aliassime.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, 21, swept to a 6-1, 6-1 victory over the Canadian in just 75 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an objective since the start of the year to try and win the gold medal and now we have one match left to try and get it done," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to have fun in the final and do the business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish star, playing on the same Roland Garros court where he won the French Open in June, broke the 19th-ranked Auger-Aliassime three times in the first set, racing away with six consecutive games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz broke again in the fourth and sixth games of the second set on his way to claiming a fourth successive win over the Canadian having lost the first three of the pair's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very complete performance and I played at a very high level from start to finish," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had very good feelings and sensations, I'm so happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The final is very important for me and the Spanish people but I try not to think about how important it is and will focus on the match," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wimbledon champion Alcaraz is the third Spanish man to reach the Olympic men's final after Jordi Arrese at Barcelona in 1992, Sergi Bruguera in Atlanta four years later and Rafael Nadal who won gold at Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now has the chance to become the youngest men's champion since tennis returned to the Olympics at Seoul in 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz will face Novak Djokovic who reached his first Olympic final in what should be a dream showdown for gold in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top seed Djokovic, still seeking an elusive Olympic title to sit along his 24 Grand Slams, defeated Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-2 in a nail-biting semi-final during which he was handed a code violation for swearing at the chair umpire. (AFP)

 Wang Zongyuan and Long Daoyi won the men's synchronised 3-metre springboard event at the Paris Olympics on Friday to claim the nation's fourth gold in diving.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both second-time Olympians, the pair finished on 446.10 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, previously won gold in the same event in Tokyo three years ago with Xie Siyi, who is only competing in the individual event as defending champion in this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo trailed after the fourth of six dives, but they rallied on the final two dives to take China's fourth straight gold medal and stay on track for an unprecedented sweep of all eight diving events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long and Wang held off the Mexican team of Juan Celaya and Osmar Olvera with 444.03.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding of Britain took bronze with a score of 438.15. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Friday fought hard for the best rank he could get in the men’s single sculls at the Paris Olympic Games, despite dropping out of contention for a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu began in the second lane of the final group D race, where he was competing for the 19th to 24th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started off second in the first 500 metres, before pulling himself to the front of the pack in the next 1,000 metres. But Quentin Antognelli of Monaco came from behind to overtake Chiu in the end with a time of 6 minutes and 54.93 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we were unable to get a medal, I hope this serves as motivation and inspiration for younger rowers," Chiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want them to fight hard for their dreams and dream big, and we can have higher and faster results in future international events,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who finished second out of six in his race with a time of 6 minutes and 56.65 seconds, ranked 20th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He previously competed in the Rio Olympic Games, where he finished 19th in the lightweight double sculls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Table tennis powerhouse China on Friday secured places in both singles finals at the Paris Olympics, after Fan Zhendong made it through on the men's side while Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha set up an all-China final in the women's competition.

  Fan, the second seed on the men's side, crushed local favourite Felix Lebrun 4-0 in a little more than half an hour in the final four.

  Fan won 11-8, 11-6, 11-7 and 11-5 to silence the home crowd.

  <br/>
  He became China's only medal hopeful in the men's singles after top-seeded Wang Chuqin was stunned by Sweden's Truls Moregard in an earlier round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-seeded Lebrun, who's only 17, did manage a three-point lead in the third game, but was otherwise outclassed by Fan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will face Moregard in the final, after the Swede defeated Brazil's Hugo Calderano 4-2 in a gruelling semi-final matchup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chen has a chance to retain her Olympic singles title, after an emphatic 4-0 trouncing of South Korea's Shin Yubin in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Sun Yingsha, also from China, secured an all-China final after brushing aside Japan's Hina Hayata 4-0 in the other semi-final tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun won 11-6, 11-8, 11-8, 11-2, while not allowing the Japanese to take a lead in the last two games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 It will be a guaranteed gold and silver for the national team as two Chinese pairs advanced to the final in the women’s doubles badminton event on Friday at La Chapelle Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first semi-final match, the pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan beat their Malaysian counterparts 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number one duo easily took the first game, 21-12, against Pearly Tan and Muralitharan Thinaah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Malaysians fought back 21-18 in the second, the first game the Chinese duo dropped in five matches throughout the tournament in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia then repeatedly targeted Tan, winning one point by directing multiple smashes at the Malaysian who managed a couple of acrobatic saves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese eventually prevailed and took the final game, 21-15, to book their place in the final. The two had won silver medals at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other match, Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning won in straight sets, after defeating Nami Matsuyama and Chiharu Shida of Japan 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides fought aggressively in game one. The points were fairly equal until the national team pulled ahead to take it 21-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though the Japanese team managed to win a few points in the first half of the second game, the Chinese pair were able to widen the gap, ultimately winning 21-19.

<div class="itemFullText">
 For any Olympian, there's no shame in losing to the world's best player. There's even less shame when that player wasn't even born when you first competed at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But that's exactly the situation that 61-year-old table tennis player Ni Xialian found herself in in the women's singles in Paris. The Shanghai native, who represents her adopted country of Luxembourg, has been winning hearts as she proves that age is but a number... even when it comes to playing a sport at the very highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni wrote herself into Olympic history as the oldest competitor to win a table tennis match when she beat Sibel Altinkaya of Turkey 4-2 in the round of 64 in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni, who won a mixed doubles world championship for China in her youth before moving to Europe, said she has already reached her goal of being able to compete at the Olympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Olympics has its own difficulties, but every time is exciting and a wonderful experience. For the technique part of the game, it depends on the draw," she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important. If you have some difficult draw, it's difficult. But of course, my age, you cannot against the nature. Every year getting more difficult, that's a fact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni's Olympic journey ended on Wednesday after she was beaten by world number one Sun Yingsha of China, who is 38 years younger than her. Sun was born just a couple of months after Ni's first Olympic campaign, in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy to have this opportunity and not every day have such a chance, she's number one and people say I'm the only one, so I think it's a very happy, interesting game and we are showing Chinese table tennis [to] the world," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's such a strong, different generation and different area, and I hope I can offer a wonderful game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though Ni has completed her Olympic journey - at least until 2028 - she has won the hearts of many fans for her youthful spirit, becoming a social media hit after her inspiring performance at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people expressed their respect for her performance, while many others commented on the athlete's cuteness when she deployed spin to return her opponent’s shots.

 No medals for Hong Kong, China on Day 6 of the Olympic Games in Paris, although the SAR's athletes saw action in the pool and on the waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were more golds to celebrate for China in men's shooting and women's athletics, plus an historic result for Zheng Qinwen who beat the world number one to reach the women's Olympic tennis final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of the day, China top the medals table with 11 golds, with the US in second place. Hong Kong are now ranked 14th with two gold and two bronze medals.
  <br/>

   Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheng dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the women's event, Ma fell two places to finish 14th overall and was also out of the competition.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kate Douglass underlined her remarkable versatility with gold in the women's 200 metres breaststroke at the Paris Olympics on Thursday, beating Tokyo champion Tatjana Smith who bows out of a stellar swimming career with a silver medal in her final race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking full advantage of her turning prowess, American Douglass nudged ahead of Smith after every length and held off the South African to touch the wall in 2:19.24 at La Defense Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really excited. I feel like for a while I wasn't sure if Olympic champion was going to be possible for me to say, and now it's just really exciting to see it happen," Douglas told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion Tes Schouten won bronze for the Netherlands, her first Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's finals, Hubert Kos took Hungary's first swimming gold of the Paris Olympics when he won the men's 200 metres backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Apostolos Christou took the silver and Switzerland's Roman Mityukov the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia rounded out the evening with victory in the women's 4x200 metres relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world record holders didn't have it all their own way though, as they were pushed hard in the first three legs by the US and defending champions China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, world record holder Ariarne Titmus anchored the Aussies to an Olympic-record winning gold while the US took silver and China the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US silver meant also that Katie Ledecky became the most decorated female swimmer of all time with 13 Olympic medals. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zhang Yufei came up short in her title defence of the 200m butterfly, coming back third while relinquishing her Olympic record to eventual champion Summer McIntosh of Canada.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zhang, who earlier took bronze in the 100m butterfly, was in the chase at the halfway mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But McIntosh powered into a decisive lead by the final turn of the pool, while American Regan Smith also caught up with Zhang down the stretch to clinch silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIntosh touched the wall after two minutes and 3.03 seconds, smashing the previous record set in Tokyo by more than eight-tenths of a second. Zhang came back over two seconds later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Jiangsu native has one more shot at gold in the 50m freestyle, which starts on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday evening, China added a bronze in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Junxuan and Li Bingjie, who were part of the quartet who struck gold in Tokyo, were joined by Ge Chutong and Liu Yaxin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finished at just over seven minutes and 42 seconds, around four seconds behind winners Australia, while the United States took silver.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong scraped through to the men's singles semi-final after a pulsating contest against Japan's Tomokazu Harimoto.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who bagged silver in Tokyo, erased a two-game deficit before outlasting his opponent 4-3 in 68 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was a major relief for Chinese fans, after top seed Wang Chuqin suffered a shock exit in the round of 32 yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan's defeat would be a huge disappointment for China, as they have finished on the podium of the men's singles in every Games since 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I felt I didn't perform particularly well today, and allowed my opponent to dictate the rhythm," Fan told RTHK after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to break through, and kept my confidence. Eventually I found a way while keeping the score close, and waited for the momentum to shift."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will next take on 17-year-old French prodigy Felix Lebrun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Sun Yingsha reached the last four in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top seed has not dropped a single game so far in Paris, going 16-0 following her latest victory over Chinese Taipei's Cheng I-ching in the last eight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, who already bagged a gold in the mixed doubles, will next face Hina Hayata of Japan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Simone Biles clinched her sixth Olympic gold medal in front of an ecstatic crowd at the Paris Games on Thursday, reasserting her status as the number one all-around gymnast three years after she withdrew from the same final at the Tokyo Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight race between Biles and Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, the American was surprisingly left trailing in third place after a flawed performance on the uneven bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she was back on top after a solid performance on her next apparatus - the balance beam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she waited to perform last on the floor, she knew the gold would be hers if she avoided any unexpected slip ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She executed an electrifying routine to secure the gold with a total of 59.131 points, just 1.199 points ahead of her Brazilian rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andrade earned a second successive silver in the competition where each gymnasts needs to show off their skills on all four women's apparatus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles' teammate Sunisa Lee, the Tokyo all-around champion, fought back from a disappointing start on the vault to claim thee bronze with 56.465 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles captured her second gold medal of the Paris Games, and her second all-around Olympic title after also winning the individual event in Rio in 2016. She also claimed the team gold earlier this week. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma have both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheng entered the day ranked ninth overall out of 24 men's entrants, having won a race yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two remaining races were scrapped, meaning the 24-year-old had no chance to make up lost ground. Only the top 10 surfers would reach the knockout stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma, on the other hand, fell two places to finish 14th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was disqualified on the first race on Thursday, and placed 15th and 10th in the ensuing two. Like the men's competition, the two final women's races were cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday has a lot of catching up to do after the opening day of dinghy competition in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Olympic debutante is placed 28th out of 43 after two races, with eight still to come over the coming four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner for each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday is now on 49 points, compared with 27 for Jean-Baptiste Bernaz of France in 10th place.

 Italy's Lorenzo Musetti knocked defending champion Alexander Zverev out of the Olympic Games tennis tournament on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Musetti triumphed 7-5, 7-5 over the German world number four in the quarter-finals and will face either top seed Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas for a place in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz of Spain stormed into the semi-finals with an imperious display of tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, playing on the same Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros where he captured the French Open in June, saw off 13th-ranked Tommy Paul of the United States 6-3, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Alcaraz recovered from a break down in the second set to defeat Paul, having also beaten the American in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon on his way to the title at the All England Club last month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen of China stunned women's world number one Iga Swiatek on Thursday to become the first player from the nation to reach an Olympic Games tennis singles final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventh-ranked Zheng triumphed 6-2, 7-5 and will face either Croatia's Donna Vekic or Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel more than just happy – happy isn't enough to describe how I feel," said Zheng, who had played back-to-back three-hour matches to make the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you ask me to play another three hours for my country, I would. It was an amazing match. To beat Iga is not easy, as it's an important event for her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek, a four-time French Open champion at Roland Garros, went into Thursday's match at a sweltering Court Philippe Chatrier on a 25-match win streak in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old had defeated Zheng in all of their six previous meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the mixed doubles, the Chinese pair of Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen reached the final after defeating their opponents from the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Zhang were slow off the block in the semi-final, conceding the opening set 2-6 to Demi Schuurs and Wesley Koolhof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese pair levelled the match at one set apiece by winning set two 6-4, before clinching the tie-break 10-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will face the winner of the other semi-final between the pairs from Canada and the Czech Republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final is scheduled on Saturday morning, Hong Kong time at Roland Garros. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Hong Kong swimmers on Thursday failed to make it out of the heats at Paris La Defense Arena, bringing their Olympic journeys to an end.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cindy Cheung, the youngest member to represent the SAR in swimming, competed in the women’s 200m backstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old maintained a steady pace in her heat against two others, finishing in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She clocked 2 minutes 17.32 seconds, more than 4 seconds behind the winner Tatiana Salcutan of Moldova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who came 26th overall among 27 swimmers, said she was not happy with her performance but that her experience in Paris had been invaluable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the end, this was a very good learning experience. I got to see how the Olympic Village was like, and experienced what it was like to compete at such a high level – the feeling is very different," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though my finishing time was not up to my expectations, this was an experience that's hard to come by."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men’s side, Ian Ho also concluded his second Olympics in the pool after he failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the men’s 50m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old came last in his heat with a time of 22.12 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finished in joint 24th place out of 73 swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really can’t complain. It’s been a good Olympics for me, and to have such a different experience from last time...Really, I’m grateful for what I’ve been able to do," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and Ho were eliminated from the women’s 100m backstroke and the men’s 100m freestyle earlier.

  Chan bowed out of the women’s foil individual event after she was beaten by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16. Still, it's the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old recalled enjoying every moment on the stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I was just focusing on the skills or tactics, what I want to do and just try my very best to score. And even though I know at the very end the gap was quite big, I didn't give up. Actually in my mind, I just want to try all my stuff and I just want to do my best," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said fellow fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung’s triumphs motivated her and other young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was amazing because my competition day was in the middle. So like before my competition day I saw Vivian got the gold medal… They brought home two gold medals which is never easy, and I think a lot of citizens will know fencing this sport and I think more and more kids will be joining this sport as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a part-time fencer who’s studying in the United States, Chan said it was difficult to juggle between fencing and her studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she made it clear she didn’t want to give up the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho, meanwhile, recalled being at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The idea of giving up came up most when I was at my lowest point, which was about two or three years after the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers. I was a bit down and confused and kind of wanted to give up, but luckily I got through in the end,” the 28-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho is the first male épéeist from the SAR to qualify for the Olympics in 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to Japan's Masaru Yamada in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This proves that we have worked very hard in the men's épée category for the past 12 years. The success of our men's épée is due to the whole team and the coaches working together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said he's proud of Ho’s performance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel that he has a lot of takeaways. He's seen his potential, his strengths, and he also has seen his room for improvement. And I hope that we can keep on growing together,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu added he's confident that fencing will continue to develop in Hong Kong because of government support and infrastructure being put in place.

          Fan simply proved too strong for his Hong Kong, China opponent. He completed a 4-1 win in 36 minutes. Wong said after the match that this could well be his last Olympics.

 Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet were the last shuttlers from Hong Kong to bow out of the Paris Olympics, as they shared an emotional moment following defeat in the mixed doubles quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The long-time partners on the court were brushed aside in straight games by the third-seeded pair of Chae Yu-jung and Seo Seung-jae.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans needed just 39 minutes to finish off the SAR duo, winning 21-15, 21-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang and Tse went down by as much as 9-16 in the opening game, before taking five of the next seven points to go within 14-18. They never got closer than that, however, and the Koreans hung on to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chae and Seo then asserted control of game two with an 8-1 run, and never relinquished the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Tang and Tse had trouble holding back tears while meeting the press afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse, who said she's grateful just to compete in Paris, revealed for the first time that she was in a hospital emergency ward two or three weeks ago but did not specify the reason.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Perhaps in the past month, I've cried every single day while on the court. Jordan withstood a lot from me," Tse said as she briefly lost her composure in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I couldn't even squeeze a toothpaste... or comb my hair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also heaped praise on Tang, saying without him she might have retired a long time ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, for his part, thanked Tse for not giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also picked up bumps and bruises here and there so I understand how difficult it is... Returning to a high level after injury is never easy, yet she's done it many times."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added they've been under immense pressure in the past year or so punching their Paris tickets, as they had trailed so much in the rankings.

 China's new swimming prodigy Pan Zhanle smashed his own world record as he destroyed the field to clinch a gold medal in men's 100m freestyle at the Olympics early on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pan, four days from his 20th birthday, finished the course in 46.40 seconds, 0.4 seconds faster than the mark he set in February in Doha at the World Aquatics Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Kyle Chalmers, more than a full second behind Pan, took silver, while Romanian David Popovici got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan's superb performance won Team China their 9th gold medal at the Paris Games and their first in the pool. It was also the first swimming world record of this year's Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey snagged another bronze medal on Thursday in the women’s 100 metres freestyle event in Paris, making her the first Hongkonger to clinch four Olympic medals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey stayed around the front of the pack throughout the first 50 metres, and was able to pull herself into second place behind the fast-starting American Torri Huske at the turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pushed through the last 50 metres and was in contention thoughout to grab a spot on the podium with a time of 52.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s world record holder Sarah Sjoestroem surged through to claim the gold with a time of 52.16 seconds, while Huske was 0.13 seconds back to pip Haughey for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters that she knew it would be a highly competitive race, so she just wanted to focus on enjoying the whole process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that my training for this race in the past few years was more intense compared to the Tokyo Olympics. I practised a lot more in terms of training time, number of minutes, and distance. Especially as you get older, your body recovery is getting worse," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Children watching TV, everyone needs to add oil (keep going). The whole journey may not be easy, but if you have a dream, just keep chasing it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey earlier won the bronze in the 200 metres freestyle event, as well as two silver medals at the Tokyo Olympics in the same respective events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sjoestroem, who set the world record back in 2017, had only committed to join the 100 metres at the last minute having previously indicated she'd focus on her favoured 50m free.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese gymnasts suffered another blow at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Thursday, after Japan's Oka Shinnosuke secured gold following a neck-and-neck battle in the men's individual all-round discipline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka and the Chinese pair of Xiao Ruoteng and Zhang Boheng were leading the pack after completing five of the six routines, with less than 0.37 points separating the trio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang went last on the last routine - the horizontal bar - and needed 14.9 points to seal victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But minor flaws in his performance meant he ended up 0.2 points short, handing victory to Oka who reigned supreme with a final score of 86.832. Xiao rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan have now won the event four consecutive times, but their defence did not come easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang stumbled out of the gate in the floor exercise, with his score of 13.233 points being one of the worst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he recovered since, even rising to medal contention with a strong 15.3 points on the parallel bars in the fifth round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang and Xiao were part of the Chinese group who coughed up the gold medal in the team event on Monday. Their teammate Su Weide fell twice from the bar in the final routine, enabling a dramatic comeback by Japan to snatch gold from China's hands.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen on Wednesday became only the second Chinese tennis player to reach the singles semi-finals at an Olympics, beating German veteran Angelique Kerber 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(6) in the quarter-finals in a three-set thriller.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two tough sets, Kerber, who won a silver medal at Rio 2016, took the lead in the third to 4-1 and received a standing ovation from an enthusiastic French crowd after saving a huge break point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having run out of steam on a hot and humid Philippe Chatrier court and lost 10 points in a row, she bounced back to 4-4. But Zheng's powerful shots allowed her to win the tiebreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the quarter-finals, at a tournament the 36-year-old had said would be her last, was the former world number one's best performance this year after returning from maternity leave in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German had lost in the first round of this year's three Grand Slams so far, the Australian and French Open followed by Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng reached a career-high ranking of No. 7 after her runner-up finish at the Australian Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the men's side, Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz shrugged off crushing humidityto stay on course for an Olympic gold medal showdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, seeking a first Olympic title at Roland Garros to add to his record-breaking collection, defeated German left-hander Dominik Koepfer 7-5, 6-3, becoming the first man to reach four singles quarter-finals at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu concluded his maiden Olympic campaign on Wednesday after losing to old rival Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei in their group stage finale.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was sent packing after 12th-seeded Chou wrapped up a 21-18, 21-13 victory in 44 minutes to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 17 Lee, who was beaten by Chou in eight of their 12 previous matchups, mostly played catch-up in their latest encounter. The SAR shuttler came back from six points down in the opening game to make it 18-19, before his opponent delivered perfect smashes to take the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chou once again moved in front in the ensuing game with a 12-6 lead, and Lee failed to erase the deficit the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the press after the match, Lee said he felt he could have done better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather up and down emotionally... I give myself too much pressure, I wanted to prove myself to others," he conceded, holding back tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before arriving [in Paris], I told my coaches, this is my only chance to prove to the world who Lee Cheuk-yiu is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to address his weaknesses and consistency issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the La Chapelle Arena in Paris, Chinese Taipei veteran Tai Tzu-ying suffered a shock group stage exit in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three, who bagged silver in Tokyo, was stunned by Ratchanok Intanon from Thailand in straight games, 19-21, 15-21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai, who was battling multiple injuries, burst into tears after the match and shared a warm embrace with her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did my best, based on my condition at this year's Games," a tearful Tai told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I can say that I have tried my best. But of course, speed-wise I was unable to catch up to my opponent."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Alex Cheng has notched his maiden race victory in the men's windsurfing competition off Marseille.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The win on his seventh attempt propelled Cheng to 11th overall among 24 entrants. He climbed another two places to ninth after coming back seventh, 10th and fifth respectively in the next three races on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five remaining races are scheduled for Thursday afternoon, local time. Only the top 10 boats in the 15-race opening series will advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng's SAR teammate, Mui Ma, dropped one place to 12th overall after another four races on Wednesday in the women's iQFOiL event. The 26-year-old started strong, finishing seventh on race eight, but her performance tapered off as the day progressed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In sailing, Hong Kong's Akira Sakai and Russell Alysworth remain last out of 20 teams following the penultimate race in the men's skiff category. Only the top 10 boats will enter the medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Nautical Stadium in Vaires-sur-Marne, east of Paris, SAR rower Chiu Hin-chun finished fifth in the six-strong semi-final of the singles skulls with a time of seven minutes, 3.68 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will wrap up his Olympic campaign on Thursday with a ranking race determining the 19th to 24th places.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Jason Ng did not finish the triathlon race which took place under the blazing Paris heat, ending his maiden Olympic journey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng completed the 1,500-metre swim in 24 minutes and 6 seconds, with a transition time of 51 seconds before starting the 40-kilometre bike ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not finish the course and was eliminated before putting on his running shoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Ng said his performance suit's zipper was pulled off during the triathlon competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the midst of the competition, my trisuit was grabbed by someone and the zipper in the back was pulled off," Ng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water kept going into my suit, and it became like a parachute. The entire suit kept pulling me backwards, and it didn't help with the water resistance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Alex Yee pipped New Zealand's Hayden Wilde for an amazing victory in the event. The Tokyo silver medallist showed his pacing mastery of the 10-km run, passing a flagging Wilde with less than 400 metres to go in blazing sunshine and 30 degree Celsius heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been postponed for a day due to the poor water quality of the Seine River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel, a Mexican living in Paris who watched the race along Avenue des Champs-Élysées, said it was worth the wait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m assuming that the people were testing the levels of bacteria. I had heard all of the things they needed to do properly so I’m glad that they did wait and it was well worth the wait. Honestly it was a great race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kristen, a spectator from New Jersey, said she enjoyed watching the race but not the idea of swimming in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I'm glad that the sun was better for them today. I still think it's gross that they had to swim in that [river],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, France's Cassandre Beaugrand won a historic gold in a thrilling women's individual triathlon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland's Julie Derron dug deep to win silver, while Great Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wong Chun-ting of Hong Kong put up a good fight in his round-of-32 men's table tennis singles match at the Paris Olympics, but he was no match for second-seeded Fan Zhendong of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan was off to a fast start, racing to a 2-0 lead by taking the first two games 11-5, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong came to life in the third game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He jumped out to leads of 4-0 and 5-1 before holding on for an 11-9 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fan simply proved too strong for his SAR opponent. He went on to capture the next two games 11-6, 11-3 to complete a 4-1 win in 36 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said after the match that this could well be his last Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Olympics this year is special. For one, I am already 33 years old, so I am considering this Olympics to be my last. Because for the next one, four years later, whether or not I can get the chance to compete is unknown, too much uncertainty," he said.

 Hong Kong table tennis player Zhu Chengzhu on Wednesday bowed out of the women's singles event at the Paris Olympics, losing 0-4 in her round of 32 match against Japan's Miu Hirano.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old kept it close in the first game, losing 13-11, but then lost the next three games, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9, in the match that lasted 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhu is choosing to look ahead, instead focusing on the positives despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy this time, and I enjoyed every game," she said after the match. "I think it’s normal whether I win or lose – there will be a women’s team battle next, so I will prepare well for every game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anything is possible because of this venue. Although I was not feeling as confident today, if I am confident, anything is possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Zhu is next set to compete in the women's team round of 16 next Tuesday, when the Hong Kong, China team take on Sweden at South Paris Arena 4.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great joy that we received this news," Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, said. "Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five women representing 34 countries and regions will kick off the contest at 2pm Hong Kong time, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Jason Ng will participate in the men's event, which begins at 4.45pm, immediately after the women's race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The results of the latest water analyses...have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place," Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris has spent US$1.52 billion of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill. (Reuters)

    Wong Ka-lee tells judokas Olympics not a pipe dream

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wong Ka-lee says she wants to show young judokas that it's possible to reach the Olympics. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763678_1_20240731090156.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Olympian Wong Ka-lee said she hopes her journey to Paris will inspire other young judokas to pursue their dreams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was the third judoka ever from Hong Kong to qualify for the Olympics, marking the return of a local judoka to the Games after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was eliminated in the women’s under 48kg competition by Austrian Katharina Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Wong believes her presence in the Olympics would show others that they too can make it to the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Younger [athletes] may think the Olympics are out of reach. But going to the Olympics this time can show them that it’s not. They can all do it,” she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete said her judo journey is far from over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics are a good experience. I see that I have obviously improved this year in terms of throwing techniques. I hope I can perform better in the next competition,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-time Olympian said she will stay in Paris to watch the matches of top judokas and visit wineries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said she will continue to sharpen her skills, and her next goal is the Asian Judo Open Hong Kong which starts in November.
