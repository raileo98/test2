 Another world record was broken at the Stade de France as Olympians battled it out on the track and field at the Olympics in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There was also more gold for China in men's shooting and gymnastics while American superstar Simone Biles saw her bid for more Olympic glory stumble on the balance beam and floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China leads the medals table with 21 golds with the United States close behind in second place with 20. Australia rise to third in the table with 13 golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's what happened on Day 10:

   <br/>
   Two rare errors proved costly for Simone Biles, as the US gymnastics superstar failed to add to her golden haul at the Paris Olympics on Day 10.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Widely considered one of the greatest gymnasts in history, Biles was bidding to add to her Paris collection of three golds in the balance beam and floor finals at the Bercy Arena.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But she slipped off the beam while walking backwards in her routine, the unusual error gifting gold to Italy's Alice D'Amato.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the floor exercise final, two landing hiccups sent her into silver behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, she leaves Paris with three golds and one silver, with a career total of 11 Olympic medals.

    China's Zou Jingyuan produced a commanding performance on the parallel bars to successfully defend his Olympic title at the Paris Games.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Zou, only the second ever back-to-back Olympic champion on the apparatus, was joined on the podium by Ukraine's Illia Kovtun in silver, with Japan's Shinnosuke Oka claiming bronze.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oka would later go on to add the horizontal bar gold to his team and all-around titles he won earlier in Paris.

     Veteran sharpshooter Li Yuehong claimed his maiden gold medal in his third Olympic appearance with victory in the men's 25m rapid fire pistol.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The 34-year-old world-record holder made 32 hits in the final to secure China's fifth shooting gold in Paris.

      South Korea's An Se-young consolidated her status as the top player in women's badminton by winning the Olympic title, beating China's He Bingjiao in the final.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Reigning world champion An, who has held the number one ranking for the past year, beat her sixth-seeded opponent 21-13, 21-16 at a lively La Chapelle Arena.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the men's singles final, Denmark's Viktor Axelsen retained his Olympic badminton title, demolishing Thailand's world champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn to claim gold.
      <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's table tennis team of Doo Hoi-kem, Lee Ho-ching and Zhu Chengzhu was unable to advance to the next stage of the women's team competition, losing 3-2 to Sweden in the round of 16.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first three matches between the teams went the distance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s Filippa Bergand and Christina Kallberg won the first two games in the first match 11-9, 11-5. The SAR pair of Doo and Lee made a strong comeback and won the next three games 11-9, 11-4 and 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhu Chengzhu took on Sweden’s Linda Bergstrom in the second match. After a tight back and forth, Bergstrom ultimately came out victorious to bring an overall tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo played against Kallberg in the third match and won the first two games 11-5, before losing the next three to the Sweden player 8-11 and 3-11 and 10-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fourth match, Zhu dominated the three games 11-8, 11-4 and 11-6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee lost 5-11, 6-11, and 10-12 in the final and decisive match against Bergstrom, bringing their Olympic journey to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo took responsibility for the loss, saying she let Kallberg back in the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel I share a bigger responsibility for the defeat because I dropped the third match, it's what led to a loss for the team," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, said she felt the team had no regrets because they had done their best.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added she had played Bergstrom before and had a tough time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the first two games against her [this time], it seems I couldn't really find good ways to make a breakthrough," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, when I found a way in the third game, it was too late. My in-game adjustments weren't bold enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR women’s table tennis team took home bronze in the Tokyo Games.

  In the women's 800 metres final, Britain's Keely Hodgkinson delivered a command performance to win the gold medal and claim her first global title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's something that I've dreamed of so much it hasn't actually sunk in yet," Hodgkinson told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The crowd was just absolutely incredible, it felt like a home Olympics for me. It just made the moment super special and I'm super happy," she added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham signed Germany striker Niclas Fuellkrug from Borussia Dortmund on Monday for a reported fee of £27.5 million (US$35 million).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fuellkrug scored 16 goals in his sole season at Dortmund to help the German giants reach last season's Champions League final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old also netted twice despite starting all five matches on the bench as Germany reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A battering ram of a centre-forward, Fuellkrug is a huge fan favourite in his homeland, with many calling for him to start ahead of Arsenal's Kai Havertz at the Euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the Premier League is the best league in the world, and for me it is the right time to move over to England and play for a big club like West Ham," said Fuellkrug in a club statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Ham have been one of the busier Premier League sides during a quiet transfer window so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wingers Crysencio Summerville and Luis Guilherme and defender Max Kilman have also joined the 2023 Europa Conference League winners for Julen Lopetegui's first season in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are delighted to have signed Niclas," said West Ham technical director Tim Steidten, who previously worked with Fuellkrug at Werder Bremen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have worked with him previously and I know what he will bring to us in terms of his physical and finishing qualities, as well as his character and mentality." (AFP)

  The last races were scrapped due to a lack of wind in Marseille, meaning Halliday had no chance to make the top 10 to enter the medal race on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR sailor ranked 24th out of 43 participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday was on 136 net points, compared with 99 for Ireland’s Finn Lynch in 10th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday said it was a shame the races got cancelled because he was feeling good to go, but overall he was satisfied with his Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be, but it was really exciting," he told RTHK in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I'm satisfied. I mean I gave it my all, I left no stones unturned, so I'm happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday added he's already setting his sights on qualifying for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Denmark's Viktor Axelsen successfully defended his Olympic badminton title on Monday, demolishing Thailand's world champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn in the men's singles final in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Backed by a vocal crowd of Danish fans at La Chapelle Arena, the second-seeded Axelsen battled past his eighth-seeded opponent 21-11, 21-11 in 52 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vitidsarn's silver was Thailand's first-ever Olympic medal in badminton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia took bronze after beating India's Lakshya Sen 13-21, 21-16, 21-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lanky Dane became the first man to retain his Olympic men's singles title since Chinese legend Lin Dan, who won in 2008 and 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Axelsen brushed aside suggestions that he had reached the same level as the Chinese player, calling him the greatest of all time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me he (Lin) is the GOAT and I'm just very happy and proud to be, in Olympic terms, on the same level," Axlesen said of Lin, who was also present in the arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in my eyes, he stands as the best ever." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rebeca Andrade of Brazil got the better of American Simone Biles in the women’s floor exercise final on Monday, bringing the artistic gymnastics competition to an end at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Andrade brought flair to her routine at the Bercy Arena, as she executed every move with precision to earn a difficulty score of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.266, to bring the total to 14.166.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the Brazilian's first gold medal in Paris after she won two silvers in the all-around and vault and a bronze in the team event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who was the floor champion in Rio in 2016, brought the highest difficulty of 6.900 to the competition with skills named after her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She completed her routine with incredible height and technique, but she stepped out of bounds which led to a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles ended up with a final score of 14.133 to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old finished the Paris Games with three golds and one silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles’ teammate Jordan Chiles was the final performer of the competition, and was fifth after her routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her score was bumped to a 13.766 after an inquiry, beating out Ana Barbosu of Romania for the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Ou Yushan finished eighth of the nine competitors with a score of 13.000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shinnosuke Oka of Japan has captured his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics, winning the horizontal bar final on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka executed a clean routine to come away with a score of 14.533.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a difficulty of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.633.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia’s Angel Barajas also had a score of 14.533 but had to settle for silver because Oka had a higher execution mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both were competing in their first Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the fourth medal in Paris for Oka, who has already won gold in the team event and the all-around as well as a bronze in the parallel bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Zhang Boheng and Tang Chia-hung of Chinese Taipei shared the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang, also a first-time Olympian, completed his routine with clean technique and execution, but the 24-year-old wasn’t able to stick his dismount, falling forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a 13.966 with a difficulty of 6.500 and execution of 7.466.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had a small fall in the middle of his routine, but the rest of his technique was able to pull him to a 13.966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The horizontal bar final saw its share of errors and falls, including China’s Su Weide who was unable to land on his feet, leaning forward to catch himself with his hands. He finished in fifth place.

 American Simone Biles fell out of medal contention in the women’s artistic gymnastics balance beam final on Monday at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Italy’s Alice D’Amato finished a solid routine to earn a score 14.366, with a difficulty score of 5.800 and an execution score of 8.566, for her first Olympic gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Zhou Yaqin earned silver thanks to a strong finish. She started off the competition with a clean routine, adding many connecting elements to boost her difficulty score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 18-year-old gymnast lost her balance at one point, but she was able to stay on the beam to earn her a 14.100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhou finished a close second behind Biles at the World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Italian gymnast, Manila Esposito, completed the podium in Paris with a score of 14.000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles slipped and fell off the apparatus at the end of her acrobatic series, unable to complete the last flip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to finish her routine and stick the landing, and the 27-year-old was tied for fourth.

 China’s Zou Jingyuan retained his title in the men’s artistic gymnastics parallel bars on Monday at the Paris Olympics, while compatriot Zhang Boheng missed out of the podium after being edged out by Japan’s Shinnosuke Oka.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's An Se-young consolidated her status as the top player in women's badminton by winning the Olympic title on Monday, beating China's He Bingjiao in the final in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Reigning world champion An, who has held the number one ranking for the past year, beat her sixth-seeded opponent 21-13, 21-16 at a lively La Chapelle Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old An is the dominant force in women's badminton and won eight titles on the world tour last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She became South Korea's first Olympic women's singles champion since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He, who lost the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, progressed to the final when her opponent Carolina Marin retired from their semi-final after collapsing with a knee injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was looking to win China's third badminton gold of the Paris Games, following successes in mixed and women's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made An work for every point in a fast and furious first game, until the South Korean began to ease ahead towards the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She closed the first game out when He smashed a return into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An quickly gained the upper hand in the second game and her march towards the title began to look inevitable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He slowed her progress with an incredible smash return midway through the game but An would not be stopped and she sealed the win on her third match point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My golden age isn't here yet because I'm still young," the South Korean gold medallist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will still have more experiences and I will be able to play even better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said she was happy to take home the silver medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think from the moment I qualified for the Olympics it’s been a hard journey, since at the time I was only able to come here because I won by a slight margin by the end. So I treasure this opportunity a lot, and I am very happy that I can come all the way from preliminaries to the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia's Gregoria Mariska Tunjung won the bronze by default after Marin's semi-final retirement. (AFP)

 Veteran sharpshooter Li Yuehong claimed his maiden gold medal in his third Olympic appearance with victory in the men's 25m rapid fire pistol on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old world-record holder made 32 hits in the final to secure China's fifth shooting gold in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's Cho Yeong-jae won silver, scoring 25, while Li's compatriot Wang Xinjie took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been an incredible experience for me – all of my personal hard work and the effort my team put into this game have finally paid off," Li said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a victory not only for myself, but rather for the whole team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li won bronze at both the Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo Olympics.

    Sprinter Felix Diu eyes new HK 100m record after Paris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Felix Diu says he wants to set a new Hong Kong record in the men’s 100m sprint. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764679_2_20240804164357.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu, fresh from his Olympic debut in Paris, said he now wants to set a new SAR record in the men’s 100m.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Diu finished fourth in his heat at the Paris Games in 10.62 seconds, and said he was thrilled to have competed with the world's top runners at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s quite awesome, because we've seen a lot of world-class athletes here and it's a great experience to see such a huge venue here and a lot of people watching me compete in the competition,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old Olympic debutant was taking part despite a leg injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu entered the Paris Games through a wild card. Olympic qualification for the 100m sprint was 10 seconds, and his personal best is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sprinter said his next goal is to break the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100m specialist noted that for the first time, the Olympic track is in purple, instead of red or blue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's made with recycled shells produced by the fishing industry, as part of efforts to promote sustainability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the track at the Stade de France is not completely rubber on the bottom but is filled with air cells of a geometric shape, to boost athletes’ performances and prevent injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think the purple track is really making the athletes really comfortable to combat in and also the material they use is very bouncing, so it's really helpful for our performance,” Diu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu started training in secondary school because he enjoyed the excitement of sprinting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I just quite enjoy the process of training and competition. It brings me satisfaction and excitement,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And with the Los Angeles Games four years away, he said he will continue to improve his game and work hard as a full-time athlete.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild in Paris, a pavilion has been set up on the sidelines of the Olympic Games to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties between China and France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China House – featuring Chinese-style galleries, exhibits and ancient Olympic sports – was launched by the Chinese Olympic Committee two days before the opening of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's deputy secretary general Yu Jianyong said the China House "is a bridge to promote friendly exchanges between China and foreign countries and promote the mutual construction of civilisations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A team of volunteers maintains its operation, some of whom are from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said it was a dream come true to be part of the Games and experience the Olympic hype in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raheema, a Chinese-Pakistani studying in the SAR, said the experience allowed her to step out of her comfort zone and meet people from all over the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As someone that is really introverted, it's really hard for me to be able to communicate with others,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics is about bringing different people with different backgrounds and different stories all together, being able to communicate with everyone I can broaden my horizons and also understand more about different people.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another volunteer, Annie, said she was inspired after seeing the earliest forms of Olympic sports at the China House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We feel like we can learn a lot more about the whole historical part and at the same time to really experience the whole Olympic atmosphere in person right in France this year.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Annie added that she also found it inspirational to speak with athletes from the national team there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the visitors at the China House was a diving gold medallist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, He Chong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he thinks people should just enjoy the Games and not put too much pressure on athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we should look at these [athletes] with a more rational perspective. They are here to join the world's top sports event and chase their dreams. We should not focus on how many gold medals they can win for China."

<div class="itemFullText">
 World records broken, defending champions prevailing, and one of the closest finishes to the men's 100 metre dash in Olympic history, were among the highlights of Day 9 in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the Games now in their second week, the US heads the medals table with 19 golds while China are second with the same amount of golds but fewer medals overall than the Americans. Hosts France are third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's a look at what happened:

   China de-throned the United States in the men's 4x100m medley relay, winning gold in a time of 3 minutes, 27.46 seconds, edging the US into silver by 0.55 seconds while France claimed the bronze.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Still, the Americans closed out the meet at the top of the swimming medals table thanks to world record efforts from Bobby Finke in the men's 1,500m freestyle and the US women in the 4x100m medley relay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom won the other gold of the night in the women's 50m freestyle.

    Team China dominated the podium with a gold and silver in the men’s rings final at Bercy Arena in Paris.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Liu Yang, who is the reigning Olympic champion in this event, earned a score of 15.300 with a difficulty of 6.400 and an executive score of 8.900 to land him the gold.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    His Chinese counterpart Zou Jingyuan, who is dubbed the king of parallel bars, came behind with a score of 15.23.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also in gymnastics, Algeria's Kaylia Nemour became the first African to win an Olympic medal in the sport when she secured the gold on the uneven bars while the Philippines celebrated their second gold of the competition when Carlos Edriel Yulo won the men's vault, a day after winning the individual floor title.

     China's dominance of the Olympic table tennis tournament continued as Fan Zhendong won gold in the men's singles, beating his Swedish opponent Truls Moregard 4-1 in the final. The result made up for his losing the final in Tokyo three years ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Noah Lyles of the United States won an enthralling and dramatic men's Olympic men's 100 metres final by fractions of a second in a time of 9.79 on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kishane Thompson of Jamaica took the silver in the same time and Fred Kerley of the US claimed bronze in 9.81.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time an American had won the title since Justin Gatlin in 2004 and Lyles raised his arms in triumph to wild cheers from the packed crowd at the Stade de France as his name appeared at the top of the standings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made a slower start out of the blocks than his rivals but accelerated through the finish to clinch victory by five thousandths of a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Yaroslava Mahuchikh completed her trophy cabinet with the women's Olympic high jump gold medal, clearing 2.00 metres in front of an adoring crowd at the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Nicola Olyslagers took silver and Ukraine's Iryna Gerashchenko and Australian Eleanor Patterson shared the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahuchikh fled her home in Dnipro after Russia's attack on Ukraine in 2022 but has kept her competitive career going and claimed Olympic gold weeks after breaking a world record that had stood since 1987 with a leap of 2.10m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world champion cleared the winning height on her first attempt and took the gold over the Australian by virtue of having fewer failures, bowing to the crowd as she took one shot at clearing 2.04m but knocked the bar down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Canada's Ethan Katzberg won gold in the men's hammer throw, cementing his dominance of the discipline after becoming the youngest ever world champion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katzberg, 22, who cuts a distinctive figure with his moustache and long curly hair, asserted himself with a first throw of 84.12 metres, and none of his rivals could respond.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary's Bence Halasz won silver with 79.97 and Ukraine's Mykhaylo Kokhan won bronze with 79.39. (Reuters)

 China dethroned the United States in the men's 4x100m medley relay, winning gold in a time of three minutes, 27.46 seconds, edging the US into silver by 0.55 seconds at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France won the bronze, handing swimming star Leon Marchand his fifth medal of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu Jiayu and Qin Haiyang kept the Chinese in contention in the back and breast strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's Maxime Grousset and the US's Caleb Dressel pulled ahead of Sun Jiajun in the fly portion of the race, but an incredible 45.92 anchor leg from Pan Zhanle, the world record holder in the 100 metres free, ensured the win for China who ended America's 64-year unbeaten run in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in the women's medley relay, the Americans dominated, smashing their own world record in the event to close the swimming meet at the Olympics with the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia took the silver and China grabbed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US quartet of Regan Smith, Lilly King, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske touched out with a final time of 3 minutes 49.63 seconds at the La Defense Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Bobby Finke smashed the men's 1,500 metres freestyle world record as he retained the Olympic gold medal in a thrilling swim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After 30 lung-busting laps, Finke touched the wall in 14 minutes, 30.67 seconds, eclipsing Chinese star Sun Yang's 12-year-old mark of 14:31.02 set at the London Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri took silver, 3.88 seconds behind Finke, with Daniel Wiffen, the 800m gold medallist, taking the bronze for Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Swedish sprint star Sarah Sjostrom completed a freestyle sprint double by adding the women's 50 metres gold to her 100 title.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Celtic made a flying start to their bid for a fourth successive Scottish Premiership title as the champions routed Kilmarnock 4-0 on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Brendan Rodgers' side finished eight points clear of second placed Rangers last term and they are already in pole position in the 2024/25 title race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Celtic have reigned supreme in Scotland in 12 of the last 13 seasons and the opening weekend of the new campaign underlined why the Hoops are firm favourites to extend their dominant era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chasing a 55th Scottish title, Celtic could not have made a better start as Kilmarnock were brushed aside at Parkhead, just 24 hours after Rangers were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw at Hearts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jim Craig, a European Cup winner with Celtic in 1967, unfurled the Premiership champions' flag before kick-off and Rodgers' men ensured the party atmosphere would last right up until the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark keeper Kasper Schmeichel made his Celtic debut in an otherwise familiar line-up which was only missing the injured Daizen Maeda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's Reo Hatate opened the scoring in the 17th minute with a powerful drive from the edge of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liam Scales headed home from Matt O'Riley's corner five minutes before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kilmarnock boss Derek McInnes rested key players ahead of his side's Uefa Conference League qualifier against Tromso on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Celtic took full advantage as Nicolas Kuhn's deflected effort flashed into the net after 59 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Substitute Anthony Ralston lashed home from a tight angle in stoppage-time as Celtic moved ahead of St Mirren on goal difference at the top of the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Sunday, Dundee fought back twice to deny arch rivals Dundee United a winning return to the top tier in a dramatic 2-2 draw at Tannadice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United were given a guard of honour on to the pitch by Dundee's players in recognition of their Championship title triumph last term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hosts made a strong start to the derby as goals from Kristijan Trapanovski and Miller Thomson, either side of Seb Palmer-Houlden's equaliser, put them in control at the interval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a late penalty from Dundee captain Luke McCowan earned them a share of the spoils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  St Mirren followed their midweek European success by opening their domestic schedule with a 3-0 win over Hibernian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stephen Robinson's side advanced to the next qualifying round of the Uefa Conference League with a 4-1 home win over Icelandic side Valur on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  St Mirren maintained their momentum as Roland Idowu fired them ahead three minutes into the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oisin Smyth headed the second in the 77th minute and bagged the third two minutes later, sending into Thursday's European tie against SK Brann in fine form. (AFP)

 US World No.1 Scottie Scheffler won gold at the men's Olympic golf competition on Sunday after matching the course record in the final round to pip crowd favourite Tommy Fleetwood of Britain.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kristen Faulkner of the United States rode her way to a shock gold medal in the women’s cycling road race on Sunday at the Paris Olympics, while Hong Kong, China's Ceci Lee completed the challenging 158-kilometre course just a few minutes behind the leaders.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American surprised crowds as she finished in a little under four hours, beating some of the world’s best for the Olympic victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marianne Vos of the Netherlands, who won this event in the London Olympics, took home silver, while Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky secured the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo of Vos and Blanka Vas of Hungary were leading the pack with just a little under four kilometres left of the gruelling race, before Faulkner and Kopoecky began to accelerate towards the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American ended up moving ahead of the leading group, finishing with a time of 3 hours, 59 minutes and 23 seconds near the beautiful Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vos, Kopecky and Vas completed in a photo finish, 58 seconds behind the champion, but Vas unfortunately was a smidge behind and missed the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee completed the course in a remarkable 4 hours, 10 minutes and 47 seconds, just around eleven minutes behind the gold medalist. The SAR athlete ranked 64th overall out of 92 cyclists, with 14 unable to complete the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said after the race she felt she was in good condition, and the course was more difficult than she expected with many steep climbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said while racing, she felt she had to toughen up so as not to waste the hard work the team and herself had put in in training. And she's glad she accomplished her goal of finishing the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather satisfied – because I just checked all the data, they were basically my best times," she told reporters. "So I would say it was a new level [of achievement]. So I hope I can build on this and perform even better in the upcoming race."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, 23, will be back in action on the track in the omnium on Sunday – the closing day of the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cyclists had to overcome 1,700 metres of climbing in nine ascents, passing by various landmarks in and around the host city.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese Taipei badminton stars Lee Yang and Wang Chi-lin successfully defended their men's doubles title on Sunday, defeating China's Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang 2-1 in a thrilling final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Taipei pair, unseeded at the tournament, jumped out to a 5-2 lead and maintained a three-point edge until midway through the first game against Liang and Wang, ranked number one in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides then traded 4-0 runs, before Chinese Taipei closed on a high to take the first game 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee and Wang kept it going to start the second game, taking an early 4-1 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Team China refused to give in, tying the score on several occasions before winning the game 21-18 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first part of the final game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than two and Chinese Taipei taking a 11-10 lead into the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a 12-11 edge, Chinese Taipei's Wang managed to save a couple of smashes from the floor before eventually conceding the point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the younger Liang and Wang shared a few smiles during breaks in the tight moments, they made several key mistakes, with Wang being called for a service violation that gave the Chinese Taipei pair a 16-13 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China managed to close the gap to 18-19, before the defending champions took control late to win the third game, 21-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who announced before the tournament his plans to retire next month after the Taipei Open, slumped to the floor alongside Wang in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two are the only badminton players from Chinese Taipei to ever win Olympic gold medals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic completed his career Golden Slam as the 37-year-old Serb fought off Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in a magnificent Olympic men's singles final battle at Roland Garros on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After heartbreak in Beijing, London, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo, Djokovic simply would not be denied the one title that had eluded him for so long, winning 7-6(3) 7-6(2) in front of a enthralled crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top seed Djokovic delivered one of the finest performances of his career to deny Alcaraz and become only the fifth player to win all four singles Grand Slams and the Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither player took a backward step in a ferocious contest in which the first set alone lasted one hour 33 minutes as they wrestled for control in a series of spellbinding games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz cracked first in the tiebreak and when another tiebreak was required to decide the second set, again Djokovic again found another gear, sealing victory with a stunning forehand winner down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic roared to the sky and after shaking hands with Alcaraz he fell to his knees on the centre of the court before climbing into the crowd to be swamped by his family and team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 21-year-old Alcaraz, who was denied the Olympic title to go with this year's French Open and Wimbledon crowns, was in tears at the end. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Algeria's Kaylia Nemour became the first African gymnast to win an Olympic medal when she secured the gold with a breathtaking routine on the uneven bars at the Paris Games on Sunday that wowed the crowd in Bercy Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 17-year-old's fast-paced routine featuring a number of complex release-and-catch manoeuvres delighted the crowd who came to support a gymnast who had previously represented France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fans roared and jumped to their feet as soon as Nemour completed her dismount. She immediately broke down in tears as she handed Algeria their first medal of the Paris Olympics, with her performance scoring a staggering 15.700 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Qiu Qiyuan, the 2023 world champion, took silver after trailing Nemour by only 0.2 of a point. US gymnast Sunisa Lee claimed a second successive Olympic bronze on the apparatus with 14.800 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nina Derwael of Belgium, the champion at the Tokyo Games, finished 0.034 of a point off the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the other Chinese competitor Zhang Yihan started the event on the high bar, but during a release, she was not able to grip back the bar leading to a deduction. She immediately got back on the apparatus to finish the rest of her routine, but Zhang did take a few steps back during the dismount to earn her a score of 12.800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And there was a second gold medal for the Philippines on Sunday. Fresh from winning the men's individual floor event, Carlos Edriel Yulo won the gold medal in the men's vault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenian Artur Davtyan won the silver medal and Britain's Harry Hepworth took the bronze. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team China dominated the podium with a gold and silver in the men’s artistic gymnastics rings final on Sunday at the Bercy Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu Yang, who is the reigning Olympic champion in this event, earned a score of 15.300 with a difficulty of 6.400 and an executive score of 8.900 to land him the gold. The 29-year-old executed his movements with precision and stability, with just a small step and lean forward during the landing.

  His Chinese counterpart Zou Jingyuan, who is dubbed the king of parallel bars, came behind with a score of 15.233, while Eleftherios Petrounias of Greece, who also won the bronze in this event at the Tokyo Games, completed the podium with an overall score of 15.100.

  Liu said afterwards he was glad he was able to defend his Olympic crown, but he felt his performance "wasn't perfect enough".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Compared to Tokyo, psychologically and experience wise, I'm now more mature. But physically, I have had a lot more injuries and issues, and so this time, it's mainly about overcoming physical problems," he told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu added that he wanted to thank his family and the motherland for their support, while saying the gymnastics team had been united despite some regrets at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's gymnasts won the silver in the team event, after a slip up in the last round saw Japan leapfrog them for gold.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong on Sunday won gold in the men's singles at the Paris Olympics, beating his Swedish opponent 4-1 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who won silver at the Tokyo Games three years ago, fell behind early, with Sweden's Truls Moregard winning the opening game 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the second seed from China came roaring back, winning the next four games to clinch victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan took the second and third games 11-9 and the fourth game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fifth game, the 27-year-old Fan raced to a big 10-3 lead before Moregard saved five match points to make it 10-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan secured the next point to win the game and his first Olympics singles title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to compatriot Ma Long in the final in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is also China's 17th gold medal at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I have to believe in my ability and my strengths, to keep myself calm and be able to bring the match to my own pace," Fan said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did not do too well in the first game, as well as the opening of the second game. But I adjusted my mentality and played better later on."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the end of a dream run for Moregard, ranked 26th in the world, who upset the Chinese top seed Wang Chuqin in the round of 32 en route to the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Lebrun from France, who was beaten by Fan in the semi-finals, claimed bronze after defeating his Brazilian opponent, Hugo Calderano.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italian rider Enea Bastianini completed the British MotoGP double for Ducati on Sunday by winning the grand prix, while Jorge Martin of Spain reclaimed the championship lead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bastianini added to his sprint win on Saturday by racing past Martin inside the last two laps to claim victory, while the Spaniard finished second to move back above third-placed Francesco Bagnaia in the overall riders' championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ducati-Pramac's Martin arrived at Silverstone 10 points behind Bagnaia, who won the last four grand prix, but second-placed finishes in the sprint and grand prix meant he leapfrogged the Italian back into the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a weekend to forget for Bagnaia after he crashed out of the sprint and then ceded the early lead in the grand prix race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his compatriot Bastianini will have fond memories of Silverstone 2024 after producing a stunning late run to sprint to the double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bagnaia sprang into the lead from the start but was eventually reeled in on lap 14 by Martin, who had started on the second row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bastianini soon caught up with the two pacesetters and, after going past Bagnaia, he made his move on turn three of the 19th lap to fly ahead of Martin and sprint towards the chequered flag. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's He Bingjiao on Sunday booked a place in the women's badminton singles final at the Paris Olympics after her semi-final opponent withdrew because of injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Spain's Carolina Marin, who won gold in the 2016 Rio Games, started off strong against the Chinese shuttler, taking the first game 21-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marin was leading 10-6 in the second when she appeared to have injured her right knee and collapsed to the floor in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She put on a knee brace and played two more points before deciding to retire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard limped off the court to a standing ovation from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her Chinese opponent told reporters that she felt very sad about what had happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was playing perfectly well and I was very passive," said He. "I wasn't thinking about the final at all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He advanced to the final to play world number one, An Seyoung from South Korea, who beat Indonesia's Gregoria Mariska Tunjung in the other semis. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Vivian Kong bids farewell to fencing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vivian Kong says she’s going to start a charity to help kids pursue sports. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764658_1_20240804101145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong has announced her retirement from professional fencing, bidding farewell to her career as a full-time athlete.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She made history at the Paris Olympics Games, clinching the first ever gold medal in the individual epee event for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old’s résumé includes three Olympic appearances, two world championship bronze medals, as well as six Asian Games medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m so grateful to have had the chance to dedicate almost 20 years of my life to fencing and thank you for being a part of this journey,” she wrote in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After competing in my third Olympics, I have decided to take a break from professional fencing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong said she’s going to start a new career and launch her own charity to help kids find joy and playfulness in sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I will miss my fencing family so so much, but once a fencer, always a fencer,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, said Kong had informed him of her decision earlier, saying he understood it but was sad to hear the news.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe the decision was made after long-time consideration and family discussions. I wasn't surprised when she told me about the decision,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “She is such a high performance athlete who has just won an Olympic gold medal and is at the peak of her athletic career. This is something many athletes can only dream of… I’m really sad to see her go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng said that Kong’s departure will definitely have an impact on the fencing team, but added that he remains optimistic about the team's future development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patrick Yung, a surgeon who performed two knee operations on Kong, said he is behind the Olympic gold medallist's decision to hang up her sword.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong suffered serious anterior cruciate ligament injuries in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think those injuries suffered by Vivian over the past years did affect her decision for retirement or not," Yung, who chairs the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology at Chinese University, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But over the past few years, it's not just physical demands, [there's] also very high mental stress for a lot of Olympians representing Hong Kong. That's why I am not surprised to see not just Vivian, but even others, would like to take a break, [go on] holiday, or do something else, so that they can recover physically and mentally."

   Chinese tennis star Zheng Qinwen has claimed the biggest victory of her budding career, clinching a gold medal on her Olympic debut by defeating Croatian veteran Donna Vekic in the women's final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sixth-seeded Zheng made a name for herself after upsetting world number one Iga Swiatek in the last four. The 21-year-old carried that momentum into the showdown at Roland Garros, leading Vekic from wire to wire for the 6-2, 6-3 victory.

 Femke Bol ran a stunning last lap to lead the Netherlands to victory in the Olympic 4x400 metres mixed relay on Saturday, glorious redemption for the 24-year-old who fell just before the line in the same race at last year's world championships.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bol got the baton in fourth place, around 20 metres behind the leading Americans, but ate up the ground in a spectacular 47.93-second leg before passing American Kaylyn Brown just before the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dutch team of Eugene Omalla, Lieke Klaver, Isaya Klein Ikkink and Bol clocked three minutes 7.43 seconds, missing the world record time the Americans set in Friday's heats by just two-hundredths of a second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, Julien Alfred delivered a brilliant gun-to-tape performance to win the women’s 100 metres final and claim Saint Lucia’s first-ever Olympic medal, though the controversial absence of Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce left a cloud over the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alfred made her usual slick start and remained clear in heavy rain on a sodden track to come home in a national record 10.72 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World champion and race favourite Sha'Carri Richardson took silver in 10.87 but the American never really threatened and her compatriot Melissa Jefferson claimed bronze in 10.92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Double Olympic champion Fraser-Pryce, appearing in her fifth Olympics, was listed as 'Did Not Start' shortly before the semi-finals and her lane remained empty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social media footage later emerged of her and Jamaican team members arguing with officials who appeared to be refusing to let her in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fraser-Pryce was heard saying "they've changed the rules, we always come through this gate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World Athletics said it was still awaiting official confirmation of the reason for her absence from the Jamaican team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norway's Markus Rooth captured a shock gold medal in the men's decathlon after defending champion Damian Warner's title defence ended when he failed to clear a height in the pole vault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Thea LaFond made history for her Caribbean island nation of Dominica by winning gold in the triple jump to claim the country's first ever Olympic medal.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Katie Ledecky won a record-equalling career ninth gold medal at the Paris Olympics by claiming an unprecedented fourth women's 800 metres freestyle title on Saturday, while Team China added a relay silver to their collection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American great touched the wall in 8:11.04 at La Defense Arena, 1.25 seconds ahead of Australian silver medallist Ariarne Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paige Madden took bronze for the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ledecky's ninth gold from four Games gives her a share of the all-time record for female Olympians with former Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also joined fellow American great Michael Phelps as the only swimmer to win four Olympic golds in the same event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States won the mixed 4x100 metres medley relay gold with a world record time, as France's Leon Marchand suffered his first defeat in a final at the meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China took the silver and Australia the bronze. France, with four-gold hero Marchand swimming the second leg, finished fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winning time of three minutes 37.43 seconds smashed the record of 3:37.58 set by previous champions Britain at the 2021 Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Canada's Summer McIntosh won the women's 200 metres individual medley in an Olympic record time for her third swimming gold of the Games and fourth medal overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kate Douglass of the United States won the silver and Australian Kaylee McKeown the bronze after US swimmer Alex Walsh was disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gold completed a medley double for the 17-year-old McIntosh, who won the 400 IM last Monday. She also won the 200 butterfly on Thursday and took silver in the 400 freestyle on the opening Saturday. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tennis star Zheng Qinwen has claimed the biggest victory of her budding career, clinching a gold medal on her Olympic debut by defeating Croatian veteran Donna Vekic in the women's final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sixth-seeded Zheng made a name for herself after upsetting world number one Iga Swiatek in the last four on Thursday. The 21-year-old carried that momentum into the showdown at Roland Garros, leading Vekic from wire to wire for the 6-2, 6-3 victory in one hour and 45 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After converting on her first match point, China's top woman dropped to the ground and punched her fists in the air as a large Chinese contingent in the stands erupted in cheers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng is the first Chinese woman to win an Olympic singles gold, and to achieve the feat on her debut made it all the more special.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compatriots Li Ting and Sun Tiantian also struck gold in 2004 in the women's doubles, while Yan Zi and Zheng Jie took home bronze at the same event four years later in Beijing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgium's Remco Evenepoel made history on Saturday in the men's cycling road race, though Hong Kong's Vincent Lau dropped out almost three-quarters of the way through one of the most gruelling of all Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel, who won the time trial a week earlier, became the first man to claim gold in both road cycling disciplines, despite having to swap bikes four kilometres from the finish because of a mechanical failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He took control 15 kilometres from the end of the 273km race around Paris and surrounding areas to cross the finish line near the Eiffel Tower one minute and 11 seconds ahead of Valentin Madouas of France. Another home athlete, Christophe Laporte, completed the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau pushed hard and cycled beyond the 200-kilometre mark, but he unfortunately couldn’t keep up with the peloton, becoming one of 13 participants who failed to complete the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was disappointed he could not reach the finishing line, but he was excited to have raced alongside some all-time greats of the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Performance-wise, I think I could do better. But the experience, I think, it's the best you can get. A cycling race in France, it doesn't get bigger than this," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seeing all the fans on every climb, shouting 'allez, allez, allez', it's every cyclist's dream to have that crowd on a climb cheering you on. I think the experience is very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 90 cyclists in the pack had to overcome 2,800 metres of climbing on 13 ascents throughout the course, which passed many Parisian landmarks before winding into the French countryside.

    Rangers held by Hearts on opening day of SPL season

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rangers were forced to settle for a disappointing 0-0 draw against Hearts in the opening game of the new Scottish Premiership season on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With Scottish champions Celtic starting their title defence at home to Kilmarnock on Sunday, Rangers had an opportunity to issue a statement of intent to their title rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Philippe Clement's side produced an erratic display at Tynecastle characterised by poor finishing and a lack of cohesion in midfield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was exactly the kind of concerning display Rangers fans had feared after Clement sounded a warning on the eve of Rangers' latest bid to win their first title since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belgian took over from Michael Beale last October and sparked an upturn in form that included a League Cup triumph and briefly brought them back into title contention before Celtic pulled away in the closing stages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But just 24 hours after agreeing to extend his contract until 2028, Clement hardly inspired confidence when he admitted before kick-off that his squad was "probably not stronger" than last season and might need several months to get up to speed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rangers endured a difficult close-season marred by unconvincing friendly performances, debatable transfer activity and construction delays that meant their renovated Ibrox stadium was not available for the start of the season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Clement's cautious tone appeared prophetic as Rangers struggled to keep Hearts at bay in a frantic start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland striker Lawrence Shankland, who scored 24 league goals last season, started for Hearts amid speculation over a potential move to Rangers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shankland took just 60 seconds to underline his quality with a stinging strike that forced a good stop from Jack Butland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Rangers goalkeeper was called into action again moments later to repel James Penrice's strike after a slick move carved open the visitors' defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rangers were on the ropes and Yan Dhanda's curler ricocheted off the crossbar as Hearts pressure mounted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Connor Barron made his Rangers debut after joining from Aberdeen, but Robin Propper, who signed from FC Twente on Thursday, was denied his Rangers debut due to paperwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barron was inches away from putting Rangers ahead against the run of play but the midfielder's low drive was clawed to safety by Zander Clark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyriel Dessers squandered an even better chance for Rangers when the striker scooped over from close range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hearts were just as profligate as Barrie McKay blazed over from Dhanda's defence-splitting pass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dhanda appealed in vain for a penalty after his cross hit Barron on the hand, but Rangers finally had some momentum and Clark saved well from Dessers just before half-time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dessers missed another golden opportunity early in the second half, the striker's luck completely out as he hit the bar from close range and watched in disbelief as the rebound cannoned off the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vaclav Cerny came off the bench for his Rangers debut after signing on loan from Wolfsburg, before Clark's superb save stopped Tom Lawrence's half-volley dipping into the top corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Held in check for long periods by the Rangers defence, Shankland managed to wriggle clear for a near-post effort that Butland parried away, but neither side could find a winner.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Simone Biles won the vault final on Saturday to clinch her third gold medal of the Paris Games, dominating the competition with her signature Biles II vault to beat Brazilian silver medallist Rebeca Andrade with American Jade Carey taking bronze.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biles soared high into the air as she performed her explosive Yurchenko double pike for a massive score of 15.700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American also impressed with her second effort. She powered down the runway and launched into the Cheng vault, which incorporates a round-off, half-on entry with a one-and-a-half twisting flip to finish. She earned 14.900.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old claimed a comfortable victory at the Bercy Arena with an average of 15.300 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles arrived in Paris as the world's most decorated gymnast and she has reached new heights by claiming gold medals in all three women's events contested so far in Paris. She now has 10 Olympic medals overall, with seven of them being gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She led the US team to the top of the podium in the team final before claiming a second all-around Olympic title two days ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles can add to her tally further when she competes in the balance beam and women's floor finals on Monday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's badminton pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan on Saturday won an Olympic gold in Paris, defeating compatriots Liu Shenshu and Tan Ning in straight games for the women's doubles title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu and Tan – the third seed at the Paris Games – took a 20-17 lead in the first game, but the top seeded Chen and Jia saved four game points to win 22-20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensing that their opponents' confidence was wavering, Chen and Jia rushed to a 9-2 edge to start the second game, before leading 11-7 at intermission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu and Tan then cut the deficit to bring the score to 11-13, but that was the closest they managed to get, as the top shuttlers won the second game 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was China's first gold in the women's doubles since 2012, and sixth since the event became a fixture at the Olympics in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia had previously come up short in Tokyo, finishing second on the podium after losing to Indonesians Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's table tennis player Chen Meng on Saturday put herself in the record books with an emphatic 4-2 victory against compatriot Sun Yingsha in Paris, becoming the third person to defend an Olympic women's singles crown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The all-China matchup was a repeat of the Tokyo Games, when Chen also defeated Sun by the same margin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's final was an intense affair, with top-seed Sun starting off well – winning the first game 11-4 – before second-seeded Chen won the next two, 11-7, 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determined not to go down 1-3, Sun scored five straight points in game four to break a 5-5 tie and eventually wrapped up the game 11-9 to tie the score at two games apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the pivotal game five, the score was tied multiple times, with Chen eventually breaking the deadlock at 9-9 to win 11-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She went on to take the final game 11-6 to seal the win, following in the footsteps of ping pong greats Deng Yaping and Zhang Yining, who had successfully defended their Olympic singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the sport was introduced to the Olympics in 1988, China has won all 10 gold medals in the women's singles.

<div class="itemFullText">
 SAR sailor Nicholas Halliday on Saturday improved his overall ranking in the men's dinghy, going up by three places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old completed two more races – coming in 6th place in the second one – on the third day of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Halliday has four more races to go over the next two days in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is now ranked 25th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 89 net points, compared with 63 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

    HK relay swimmers happy despite dropping out

<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China, women's swimmers on Saturday finished their 4x100 metres medley relay ranked 13th out of 14 teams, saying they all very much enjoyed their last race at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephanie Au, Siobhan Haughey, Natalie Kan and Karen Tam clocked a time of four minutes and 3.56 seconds, nearly two seconds short of the Hong Kong record the four hold, and more than a second slower than their Paris entry time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au, competing in her fifth Olympics, had a strong start, as she helped the team stay in the middle of the pack in the backstroke leg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when Haughey finished off her breaststroke leg, the SAR squad was among the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kan and Tam tried to catch up in butterfly and freestyle, but to no avail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They ended up being seventh in their heat, with Denmark being disqualified. Team Australia won the heat and were the fastest entering the finals, with Team China second in the heat and third overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au described their finishing time as less than ideal, but the swimmer said she was thankful for the experience because she had many family and friends in the stands cheering for her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said she was pleased with her overall performance in Paris, saying she very much enjoyed being with her fellow relay swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think when you evaluate a competition, you don't just look at the results because there are a lot of details behind it. You don't just determine [a competition] with the time and rank," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kan, making her Olympic debut, said while their time fell short of expectations, she had no regrets because she knew the whole team already did the best they could.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam said everyone enjoyed the experience and thanked the Hongkongers in the stands who travelled all the way to Paris to support them.

    HK sprinter Felix Diu unable to advance in 100m

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Felix Diu (C) was very close to advancing to the next round. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764597_2_20240803222636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sprinter Felix Diu was on Saturday eliminated in the preliminary round of the men’s 100m race, finishing fourth in his heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He was unable to establish a new SAR record with a time of 10.62 seconds, just 0.02 seconds short of coming in second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Noa Jerrel Bibi of Mauritius came first in the heat with a time of 10.27 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diu's time was 0.34 seconds short of the Hong Kong record of 10.28 seconds, jointly held by Tsui Chi-ho and Ng Ka-fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top two in each heat and the four fastest runners from the rest of the pack can advance to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 100-metre specialist entered the Olympics through a wild card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic qualification for the 100m dash is 10 seconds and Diu’s personal best, which is also his best time this year, is 10.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the race, Diu expressed disappointment with his performance, saying he had been dealing with a leg injury, and that has affected his training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, my condition wasn't as good as it was when I clocked a 10.33, so perhaps I will just work harder next time, and in competitions next year," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While being the third Hong Kong sprinter in history to make it to the 100m race at the Games, the sprinter, 24, said he learnt quite a lot from his "unforgettable" Olympic debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a rather shocking and exciting experience. There are so many spectators in the stadium cheering for athletes, it's really something different."

    France win over Argentina sparks ugly scenes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The trouble flared at full-time between the now arch-rivals. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764542_1_20240803061813.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's grudge match with Argentina ended in ugly scenes after Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal to put the hosts into the Olympic semi-finals on Friday with a 1-0 win, joining Spain, Morocco and Egypt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tensions spilled over at full-time in Bordeaux with rival players and staff clashing on the pitch and confrontations continuing down the tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crystal Palace striker Mateta struck five minutes into the quarter-final, meeting Michael Olise's corner with a superb near-post header.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That proved enough for the hosts, coached by Thierry Henry, to reach the last four, where they face Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's clash was the first meeting of the nations since Argentina players were recorded singing racist chants about their French counterparts as they celebrated winning the Copa America in mid-July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifa announced it would investigate the chants, which targeted France's star striker Kylian Mbappe among others and included racist and homophobic insults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Argentina team were met with a hostile welcome, where the crowd loudly jeered their national anthem as the sides met for the first time since the 2022 World Cup final, which the South Americans won on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry said midfielder Enzo Millot, who had been substituted late on, was shown a red card after the final whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He wasn't on the pitch. Maybe you get sent off because you get a second yellow card to stop someone running through on goal, not when you are on the bench. I am really not happy about that," Henry told broadcaster France 3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giuliano Simeone and Julian Alvarez missed chances for Javier Mascherano's Argentina, and the exit of the two-time gold medallists means the winner of men's football gold will not come from Latin America for the first time since Cameroon triumphed in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France could have won by a wider margin, but Olise had a late second goal disallowed for a foul in the build-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will now be heavy favourites to win a semi-final in Lyon on Monday against Egypt, who beat Paraguay 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ibrahim Adel was Egypt's hero, scoring a late equaliser in normal time and then converting the winning penalty in the shoot-out, in which Paraguay's Marcelo Perez was the only player to fail to score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier a brilliant brace by Barcelona's Fermin Lopez helped fire Spain to a 3-0 win over Japan in Lyon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lopez, a member of Spain's triumphant Euro 2024 squad, blasted in the opener from range in the 11th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Barcelona midfielder struck again on 73 minutes with another goal of the highest quality as he controlled a Sergio Gomez corner before volleying in from the edge of the box.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Abel Ruiz wrapped up the win for Spain, Olympic champions in 1992 and silver medallists three years ago in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain go through to a last-four clash in Marseille with Morocco, who outclassed the United States, winning 4-0 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soufiane Rahimi opened the scoring from the penalty spot after he was fouled in the box just before the half-hour mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was a fifth goal in four games for the tournament's top scorer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morocco doubled their lead on 63 minutes when Abde Ezzalzouli set up Ilias Akhomach to finish at the near post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Captain Achraf Hakimi, playing on his Paris Saint-Germain home ground, ran through to make it 3-0 and substitute Mehdi Maouhoub added another penalty in stoppage time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we keep playing like this we will deserve to be in the final," said Akhomach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other countries might be talked about more than us but we know what we want. We came here to win." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Despite being cheered on by a passionate crowd inside Court Philippe Chatrier, Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen were denied a first tennis gold for China in two decades.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of clinching a first Olympic tennis gold medal in two decades were dashed as the nation's mixed doubles pair came up short against the Czech Republic in a thrilling final which ended at nearly midnight, Paris time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen were broken twice in the opening set, which they conceded after just 23 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after settling in, the pair were neck and neck against Katerina Siniakova and Tomas Machac. Set two lasted nearly twice as long, with Wang and Zhang taking it 7-5 in 40 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the match at one set apiece, a 10-point tiebreak ensued to decide who would be gold medallists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raucous Chinese supporters inside Court Philippe Chatrier were in a frenzy after their side went up 3-0. But the Czechs levelled the score and bagged the last four points of the match, including a crucial double fault by their opponents at 8-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dramatic slip-up meant China had to make do with a silver. It was still the first tennis medal for the nation since Zheng Jie and Yan Zi struck bronze in the women's doubles in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed a gold by Li Ting and Sun Tiantian in the same discipline in Athens four years prior.

 Joris Daudet led a French clean sweep of the podium in men's Olympic BMX racing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His compatriots Sylvain Andre and Romain Mahieu took silver and bronze in front of an ecstatic home crowd in the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines stadium, finally winning the Olympic medals that had so long eluded them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French have dominated BMX racing in recent decades, amassing 50 gold medals at world championships since 1982, and Daudet and Mahieu are first and second in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Olympics, however, they had only bagged two medals - both by female riders - since the sport's debut in Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Dutchman Niek Kimmann unable to defend his Tokyo 2021 title due to illness and Tokyo silver medalist Kye Whyte of Britain hampered by a back injury, the French dominated their semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron, the three French riders shot out of the starting ramp and maintained their lead throughout the final, zooming over the bumpy, winding course in a 1-2-3 formation like one blue-and-white streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BMX race, Saya Sakakibara of Australia won gold, Manon Veenstra of the Netherlands took silver and Zoe Claessens of Switzerland claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sakakibara and Mahieu, who are dating each other, will go home with a medal each - one gold, one bronze - at the same Games and in the same discipline. (Reuters)

 Medals for Team China and a dash of romance characterised day seven of the Paris Olympics on Friday, with success in diving and on the badminton court.

  <br/>

  Overall, China sit top of the medal table with 13 golds, ahead of France and Australia with 11 apiece.

 Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei won the men's 10,000 metres gold medal at the Paris Olympics on Friday, the first track medal of the athletics programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time world champion in the 10,000 metres made his move on the final lap and surged in the last 100 metres to cross the finish line in an Olympic record time of 26 minutes, 43.14 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ethiopia's Berihu Aregawi took silver and American Grant Fisher claimed the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Barely 16 years ago when I was watching the great Kenenisa Bekele win in Beijing, it was something that grew in my heart," said Cheptegei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said, 'one day I want to be Olympic champion'. It is the most special day. I can’t describe the feeling. I’ve wanted this for a long time. When I took silver in Tokyo I was so disappointed. I just wanted to win the 10,000m."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, there was an explosive start to the Olympic track and field competition at the Stade de France when the United States mixed 4x400m relay broke the world record to qualify in first place for the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quartet of Vernon Norwood, Shamier Little, Bryce Deadmon and Kaylyn Brown timed 3 minutes, 7.41 seconds, smashing the previous best of 3:08.80 set when the US won world gold in Budapest last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We wanted to come out here and execute good hand-offs," said Norwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We set the tone for the rest of the United States with that world record."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the men's decathlon, Germany's Leo Neugebauer tops the standings with 4,650 points at the half-way mark, with the second part of the competition to be held the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Dutch long-distance star Sifan Hassan launched her audacious bid for an unprecedented Olympic treble with a confident performance in the opening round of the women's 5,000 metres on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old Olympic champion is aiming to become the first woman in history to win 5,000m, 10,000m and marathon gold at the same Olympics, emulating Czech great Emil Zatopek, who achieved the men's triple at the 1952 Helsinki Games.

 China added a silver and a bronze to their haul in the men's trampoline, while reigning champion Ivan Litvinovich successfully defended his Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both Yan Langyu and 18-year-old Wang Zisai were hoping to dethrone Litvinovich, the Belarusian who competed as an "individual neutral athlete" because of his nation's involvement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, who started third in the eight-man final, briefly led the pack with a score of 61.89 while Yan was close behind in second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were judged by their routine's difficulty, execution, horizontal displacement and time of flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Litvinovich was second last to go, and he withstood pressure to win in 63.09.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leon Marchand demonstrated again on Friday why many consider him the best swimmer of his generation as he stormed to his fourth individual gold medal in the pool at La Defense Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The French star took command on the backstroke leg of the men's 200m individual medley and never looked back, winning in an Olympic record time of 1 minutes, 54.06 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Duncan Scott won his second straight silver in the event while defending champion Wang Shun of China settled for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marchand is the first French athlete to take four individual golds, as opposed to team ones, at a single Summer Games and only the third male swimmer to do so after Americans Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's incredible, it was really magical," the 22-year-old told French TV. "The whole stadium was fully behind me and I took advantage of it. It enabled me to win four medals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a good night for Australia as the Dolphins came away with two more gold medals from the meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaylee McKeown cemented her place among the greats of Olympic swimming on Friday as she became the first woman to retain both of the backstroke titles with gold in the 200m event in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old world record holder once again overhauled American challenger Regan Smith in a battle royale to claim the win in an Olympic record of 2 minutes, 3.73 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith took silver, 0.53 seconds behind her Australian nemesis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kylie Masse took bronze for Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Australia's Cameron McEvoy took his first Olympic gold medal when he won the men's 50 metres freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Ben Proud took the silver medal, and France's Florent Manaudou the bronze - 12 years after he won gold at London 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defending Olympic champion Caeleb Dressel of the United States finished sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McEvoy is the first Australian man to win the shortest distance on the programme. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong smashed their way to a gold medal in the mixed doubles badminton event on Friday at the Paris Olympics, beating Kim Won-ho and Jeong Na-eun of South Korea in straight sets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Japanese pair of Yuta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino won the bronze medal match to complete the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After receiving her medal on the podium, Huang's boyfriend and fellow Chinese shuttler Liu Yuchen proposed to her in front of an ecstatic crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang made a commanding start with a strong attack to put them far ahead. Kim and Jeong tried their best to defend, but could not overcome the world number one duo in the first game 21-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans stepped up their efforts with more attacks in the beginning of the second game, knowing this would determine their position on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese side’s tactic to target one specific player at a time immediately put them back in the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair's powerful smash shots further widened the gap to end the game 21-11 and earn a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang lost to their Chinese counterparts at the Tokyo Olympics in the gold medal match, but this time around they were able to reach the top of the podium in just under an hour of game play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cap off her already special day, Huang's boyfriend Liu made a surprise appearance at the arena. He came prepared with an engagement ring, and presented it to Huang while on one knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will love you for my whole life. Will you marry me?" Liu asked in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overcome with joy, Huang said 'yes'.

    Row over Olympic boxing gender scandal deepens

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei in action with Sitora Turdibekova of Uzbekistan. She is one of two athletes at the centre of a brewing controversy at the Olympics over gender. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764500_1_20240802224116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The double world champion from Chinese Taipei, Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the heart of a gender row, won her featherweight round of 16 bout against Uzbekistan's Sidora Turdibekova on points by unanimous decision at the Paris Olympics on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old Lin, along with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won her round of 16 welterweight fight on Thursday against Italy's Angela Carini in 46 seconds, have been in the spotlight of the gender row after being cleared to compete in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules that prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women's events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing tournament in Paris, has cleared the boxers to compete in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IBA said in a statement the athletes "did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the "specifics" of this test "remain confidential", the IBA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the Olympic body's eligibility criteria was based on the gender indicated on the boxers' passports, but acknowledged that it's "not a black and white issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither Lin nor Khelif is known to identify as transgender and both competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 in the women's competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The row has expanded outside the ring, with politicians and celebrities weighing in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the Khelif-Carini fight was "not on an equal footing", after the Italian fighter was left with a badly hurt nose and in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US presidential candidate Donald Trump declared on his Truth Social network that he would keep "men out of women's sports".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate JD Vance described Thursday's one-sided bout between Khelif-Carini as a "grown man pummelling a woman in a boxing match", adding: "This is disgusting, and all of our leaders should condemn it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Potter author JK Rowling said on X, formerly Twitter, that the Paris Games would be "forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday maintained a steady position in the pack after two more races in the men's dinghy event, with six still to come over the next three days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old is the first SAR Olympian to qualify for the ILCA 7 single-handed event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ranked 28th out of 43 sailors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10 participants with the fewest points advance to the medal race. The winner of each race is awarded one point, and the runner-up two, and so on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After excluding his worst race, Halliday is now on 65 net points, compared with 32 for Juan Ignacio Maegli of Guatemala in 10th place.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz became the youngest man to reach the Olympic Games men's tennis final on Friday when he thrashed Felix Auger-Aliassime.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz, 21, swept to a 6-1, 6-1 victory over the Canadian in just 75 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an objective since the start of the year to try and win the gold medal and now we have one match left to try and get it done," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to have fun in the final and do the business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish star, playing on the same Roland Garros court where he won the French Open in June, broke the 19th-ranked Auger-Aliassime three times in the first set, racing away with six consecutive games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz broke again in the fourth and sixth games of the second set on his way to claiming a fourth successive win over the Canadian having lost the first three of the pair's series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very complete performance and I played at a very high level from start to finish," said Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had very good feelings and sensations, I'm so happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The final is very important for me and the Spanish people but I try not to think about how important it is and will focus on the match," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wimbledon champion Alcaraz is the third Spanish man to reach the Olympic men's final after Jordi Arrese at Barcelona in 1992, Sergi Bruguera in Atlanta four years later and Rafael Nadal who won gold at Beijing in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now has the chance to become the youngest men's champion since tennis returned to the Olympics at Seoul in 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz will face Novak Djokovic who reached his first Olympic final in what should be a dream showdown for gold in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top seed Djokovic, still seeking an elusive Olympic title to sit along his 24 Grand Slams, defeated Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-2 in a nail-biting semi-final during which he was handed a code violation for swearing at the chair umpire. (AFP)

 Wang Zongyuan and Long Daoyi won the men's synchronised 3-metre springboard event at the Paris Olympics on Friday to claim the nation's fourth gold in diving.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both second-time Olympians, the pair finished on 446.10 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, 22, previously won gold in the same event in Tokyo three years ago with Xie Siyi, who is only competing in the individual event as defending champion in this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo trailed after the fourth of six dives, but they rallied on the final two dives to take China's fourth straight gold medal and stay on track for an unprecedented sweep of all eight diving events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long and Wang held off the Mexican team of Juan Celaya and Osmar Olvera with 444.03.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Laugher and Anthony Harding of Britain took bronze with a score of 438.15. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Friday fought hard for the best rank he could get in the men’s single sculls at the Paris Olympic Games, despite dropping out of contention for a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu began in the second lane of the final group D race, where he was competing for the 19th to 24th place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started off second in the first 500 metres, before pulling himself to the front of the pack in the next 1,000 metres. But Quentin Antognelli of Monaco came from behind to overtake Chiu in the end with a time of 6 minutes and 54.93 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we were unable to get a medal, I hope this serves as motivation and inspiration for younger rowers," Chiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want them to fight hard for their dreams and dream big, and we can have higher and faster results in future international events,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who finished second out of six in his race with a time of 6 minutes and 56.65 seconds, ranked 20th overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He previously competed in the Rio Olympic Games, where he finished 19th in the lightweight double sculls.

 Table tennis powerhouse China on Friday secured places in both singles finals at the Paris Olympics, after Fan Zhendong made it through on the men's side while Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha set up an all-China final in the women's competition.

  Fan won 11-8, 11-6, 11-7 and 11-5 to silence the home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became China's only medal hopeful in the men's singles after top-seeded Wang Chuqin was stunned by Sweden's Truls Moregard in an earlier round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-seeded Lebrun, who's only 17, did manage a three-point lead in the third game, but was otherwise outclassed by Fan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will face Moregard in the final, after the Swede defeated Brazil's Hugo Calderano 4-2 in a gruelling semi-final matchup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chen has a chance to retain her Olympic singles title, after an emphatic 4-0 trouncing of South Korea's Shin Yubin in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Sun Yingsha, also from China, secured an all-China final after brushing aside Japan's Hina Hayata 4-0 in the other semi-final tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun won 11-6, 11-8, 11-8, 11-2, while not allowing the Japanese to take a lead in the last two games.

 It will be a guaranteed gold and silver for the national team as two Chinese pairs advanced to the final in the women’s doubles badminton event on Friday at La Chapelle Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first semi-final match, the pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan beat their Malaysian counterparts 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number one duo easily took the first game, 21-12, against Pearly Tan and Muralitharan Thinaah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Malaysians fought back 21-18 in the second, the first game the Chinese duo dropped in five matches throughout the tournament in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia then repeatedly targeted Tan, winning one point by directing multiple smashes at the Malaysian who managed a couple of acrobatic saves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese eventually prevailed and took the final game, 21-15, to book their place in the final. The two had won silver medals at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other match, Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning won in straight sets, after defeating Nami Matsuyama and Chiharu Shida of Japan 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides fought aggressively in game one. The points were fairly equal until the national team pulled ahead to take it 21-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though the Japanese team managed to win a few points in the first half of the second game, the Chinese pair were able to widen the gap, ultimately winning 21-19.

<div class="itemFullText">
 For any Olympian, there's no shame in losing to the world's best player. There's even less shame when that player wasn't even born when you first competed at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But that's exactly the situation that 61-year-old table tennis player Ni Xialian found herself in in the women's singles in Paris. The Shanghai native, who represents her adopted country of Luxembourg, has been winning hearts as she proves that age is but a number... even when it comes to playing a sport at the very highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni wrote herself into Olympic history as the oldest competitor to win a table tennis match when she beat Sibel Altinkaya of Turkey 4-2 in the round of 64 in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni, who won a mixed doubles world championship for China in her youth before moving to Europe, said she has already reached her goal of being able to compete at the Olympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Olympics has its own difficulties, but every time is exciting and a wonderful experience. For the technique part of the game, it depends on the draw," she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important. If you have some difficult draw, it's difficult. But of course, my age, you cannot against the nature. Every year getting more difficult, that's a fact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ni's Olympic journey ended on Wednesday after she was beaten by world number one Sun Yingsha of China, who is 38 years younger than her. Sun was born just a couple of months after Ni's first Olympic campaign, in Sydney in 2000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy to have this opportunity and not every day have such a chance, she's number one and people say I'm the only one, so I think it's a very happy, interesting game and we are showing Chinese table tennis [to] the world," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's such a strong, different generation and different area, and I hope I can offer a wonderful game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though Ni has completed her Olympic journey - at least until 2028 - she has won the hearts of many fans for her youthful spirit, becoming a social media hit after her inspiring performance at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people expressed their respect for her performance, while many others commented on the athlete's cuteness when she deployed spin to return her opponent’s shots.

 No medals for Hong Kong, China on Day 6 of the Olympic Games in Paris, although the SAR's athletes saw action in the pool and on the waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were more golds to celebrate for China in men's shooting and women's athletics, plus an historic result for Zheng Qinwen who beat the world number one to reach the women's Olympic tennis final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of the day, China top the medals table with 11 golds, with the US in second place. Hong Kong are now ranked 14th with two gold and two bronze medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here's what happened.

   Hong Kong windsurfers Alex Cheng and Mui Ma both crashed out of the iQFOiL competition on the final day of preliminary action in Marseille, which was cut short by a lack of winds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheng dropped to 13th overall after coming back fifth, 19th and 15th in the three races of the day which went underway following lengthy delays.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the women's event, Ma fell two places to finish 14th overall and was also out of the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Hong Kong sailor Nicholas Halliday was placed 28th out of 43 after two races, with eight still to come over the coming four days.

    Ian Ho also failed to progress in his event. The 27-year-old came last in his 50m freestyle heat with a time of 22.12 seconds.
    <br/>

    He finished in joint 24th place out of 73 swimmers.

     Later, China's Yang Jiayu blazed to gold in the women's 20km race walk.
     <br/>
