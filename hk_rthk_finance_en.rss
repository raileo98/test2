  <br/>
  The sell-off came after the S&P 500 on Wednesday registered its biggest fall since April, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq saw its biggest fall since December 2022, losing 1.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.

    Tech shares tumble as Dow ends at 3rd straight record

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished decisively lower on Wednesday after talk that tech equities are overbought, while the Dow pushed to a third straight record high.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts described the development as an inevitable cooling in large tech names including Facebook parent Meta and artificial intelligence player Nvidia, after outsized gains in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow, however, continued to benefit from an inflow of funds to underperforming names from other sectors. The blue-chip index finished up 0.6 percent at 41,198.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent to 5,588, while the Nasdaq slumped 2.8 percent to 17,996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen a relentless rally and a pause might be healthy at this point," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, we had some concerns around semiconductors and chip makers which have been under pressure. And that's been kind of adding to the rotation narrative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Data showed that US industrial production cooled in June but still exceeded analyst expectations, with manufacturing and utilities output both rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Federal Reserve report said there has been "slight to modest" growth in economic activity in most parts of the country over recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A growing number of districts have, however, reported "flat or declining activity," said the Fed's "beige book" survey of economic conditions, which pointed to November's US presidential election and inflation as contributing to uncertainty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Johnson & Johnson rose 3.7 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits on a 4.3 percent increase in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drug and medical device company expressed confidence as it pursues regulatory approval of new products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JB Hunt Transport Services fell 6.9 percent after reporting lower profits on a seven-percent slide in revenues as the trucking and logistics company contends with tepid demand. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lands Department on Wednesday announced the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Hung Kai Properties beat 10 other bidders and won the tender for a site in Siu Lek Yuen, Sha Tin, for HK$619 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site is expected to generate around 280 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the only residential plot on offer in the April-June quarter under the government land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Victor Lui, said the company will build small and medium-sized units there, with a total investment of around HK$2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kathy Lee, head of research at Colliers, said the government's first successful sale of residential land after scrapping property-cooling measures in February sent a positive message to the market, amid concerns that developers were reluctant to bid for land.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC announced that Georges Elhedery will become the new group CEO. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761942_1_20240717132925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC on Wednesday named chief financial officer Georges Elhedery as the bank's next chief executive to drive "the next phase of development and growth".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to confirm Georges as the next HSBC Group Chief Executive," group chairman Mark Tucker said in a filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board concluded that Georges was the outstanding candidate and we look forward to working together as he leads HSBC through the next phase of development and growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery will take over on September 2 from current CEO Noel Quinn, who announced his retirement in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery joined HSBC in 2005 and previously held the role of Co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets before being appointed chief financial officer in January 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanon-born, French-educated banker also led the bank's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkey region from July 2016 to February 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before assuming the role of CFO in 2023, Elhedery had a six-month sabbatical that included spending time learning Mandarin, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery has a "track record of leading through change, driving growth, delivering simplification, containing costs and brings a strong focus on execution," Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery said he was "deeply honoured" by HSBC's trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory," he said in the filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC said it would announce the next chief financial officer in due course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn would work with Elhedery to ensure a "smooth and orderly" handover before stepping down, the bank added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn, 62, oversaw a transformation of the London-headquartered lender and saw record profits during almost five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under him, the bank accelerated a years-long pivot to Asia -- where it generates most of its revenue -- vowing to develop its wealth business and target fast-growing markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank concluded the sales of its Canadian operations and its retail bank operations in France. It will also sell its Argentina division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn last year led the effort to repel a bid by major shareholder Ping An to spin off its Asia assets, with the proposal eventually voted down by shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The break-up bid highlighted HSBC's precarious position amid US-China tensions, with some observers questioning whether Europe's largest lender can continue to straddle East and West. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to another record on Tuesday on bullish reaction to positive earnings reports amid optimism over the rising likelihood of US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The blue-chip index piled on 1.9 percent or more than 740 points to finish at 40,954.48, posting a second straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,667.20, also a record, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent to 18,509.34.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The records were driven partly by outsized gains for Bank of America and Dow member UnitedHealth Group following earnings reports, as well as an ongoing rotation of funds towards smaller companies that have underperformed in 2024 but are expected to be boosted by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides UnitedHealth, the Dow's biggest gainers included industrial giants Boeing and Caterpillar. (AFP)

    US retail sales flat in June as consumption cools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the US Department of Commerce. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761856_1_20240716215636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States slipped less than analysts anticipated in June on a weaker performance in the auto and gas segments, government data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The slower consumption growth adds to recent data showing that the world's biggest economy is cooling gradually – a trend likely to raise the central bank's confidence that it can soon begin cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To ease demand and bring inflation back down sustainably, the Federal Reserve has rapidly lifted the benchmark lending rate and in recent months, held it at a decades-high level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the Department of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, May's increase was revised slightly higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, the rise in June was 2.3 percent, a cooldown from the prior month as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have long been expecting consumers to pull back as higher interest rates bite, lifting borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that consumption growth will, if anything, slow further in [the second half this year], as high interest rates continue to weigh on demand and the labour market takes a further turn for the worse," said Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among sectors, sales at auto dealers dropped 2.3 percent from May, while those at gas stations dropped three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But excluding auto and gas, total retail sales was up 0.8 percent in June – indicating that there may still be some way to go yet in easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales at restaurants and bars was up 0.3 percent from a month prior, the Commerce Department report showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is set to make its next rate decision at the end of July, and analysts widely expect the central bank to begin lowering rates in September. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The IMF held its global growth expectations for 2024 steady in a report on Tuesday even as it cut forecasts for the United States and Japan, while warning of inflation risks and trade tensions ahead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to grow 3.2 percent this year, unchanged from its April forecast, according to its World Economic Outlook update.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports from Asia, particularly in the technology sector," said the fund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For 2025, it expects global growth of 3.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even as many countries saw better growth than anticipated in the first three months this year, the IMF flagged what it called notable surprises in Japan and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington-based lender also cautioned that upside risks to inflation have increased, with services prices holding up disinflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated for longer, "in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An area of concern is trade and industrial policy, with countries potentially adopting measures that impact the global economy's integration, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if risk assessments have shifted after the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump, the Republican Party's nominee in November's election, Gourinchas noted the fund will consider its implications. (AFP)

    China's economy slows in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's economy grew 4.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, less than analysts had expected. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761623_1_20240715111349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy expanded at a slower-than-forecast 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, the government reported on Monday, while emphasising signs of improvement in factory output, income and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter growth was below the 5.3 percent seen in the first quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists said weak consumer demand and reduced government spending were dragging on growth in the world's No. 2 economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first six months of 2024, the economy expanded by five percent, in line with the country's growth forecast for the entire year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail sales slowed to two percent growth in June, official data showed, suggesting continued struggles to boost consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In June, the total retail sales of consumer goods went up by 2.0 percent year on year," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. May's figure was 3.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were up 3.7 percent year on year in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial output, meanwhile, climbed 5.3 percent year on year last month, and rose 6 percent for the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS attributed the weaker second-quarter GDP growth to short-term factors such as extreme weather and floods, but said it also reflected rising challenges, especially from insufficient effective demand and unsmooth economic flow at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, the national economy has continued to improve in the first half in a stable manner," the NBS said in a statement, citing support from policy incentives, rebound in external demand and development of new quality productive forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Yeung, a chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that weak retail sales dragged down GDP growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's also very consistent with our on-the-ground observations in different cities in China. Of course you don't notice that when Hong Kong people go to Shenzhen. But in other cities, which is clearly more domestic, the consumption level is clearly weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release of the latest economic figures came as leaders of the Communist Party gathered for a once-a-decade conclave to set economic policy that was expected to focus on self-sufficient strategies for growth in an era of tensions over trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-day meeting of the Communist Party’s 205-member Central Committee is the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, President and party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a work report on behalf of the Politburo at the start of the third plenum and expounded on a draft decision on further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such meetings typically focus on long-term issues, but business owners and investors are watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged downturn in the property market and boost the country's post-pandemic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the third plenary session has to focus on stabilising employment, noting reports of layoffs and salary cuts in the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately, what we need is to have a stable labour market and stable employment so that households will be more confident in spending. And that wage dynamic is the most important area the policymakers really need to focus on in the future," he said. (RTHK/Agencies)

    Pakistan pledges US$7 billion IMF aid deal is last

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761475_1_20240713213426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund has agreed to loan Pakistan US$7 billion to bolster its faltering economy, with Islamabad pledging on Saturday it would be the last time it relied on relief from the Washington-based lender.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South Asian nation agreed to the deal – its 24th IMF payout since 1958 – in exchange for unpopular reforms, including widening its chronically low tax base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan last year came to the brink of default as the economy shrivelled amid political chaos following catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement, as well as a global economic downturn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries, as well as an IMF rescue package, but its finances remain in dire straits, with high inflation and staggering public debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This programme should be considered the last programme," Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told ministers and revenue officials in Islamabad. "We should tax those who are not being taxed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan announced on Friday, which will be paid out over three years subject to approval by the organisation's Executive Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came on condition of far-reaching reforms including hiking household bills to remedy a permanently crisis-stricken energy sector and uplifting pitiful tax takings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a nation of over 240 million people and where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the 2024-25 fiscal year that started at the beginning of July, the government aims to raise nearly US$46 billion in taxes, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More unusual methods have seen the tax authority block 210,000 SIM cards of mobile users who have not filed tax returns in a bid to widen the revenue bracket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the deal "revenue collections will be supported by simpler and fairer direct and indirect taxation including by bringing net income from the retail, export, and agriculture sectors properly into the tax system", IMF Pakistan Mission Chief Nathan Porter said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islamabad also aims to reduce its fiscal deficit by 1.5 percent to 5.9 percent in the coming year, heeding another key IMF demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF said the loan and its conditions should allow Pakistan to "cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Pakistan's public debt remains huge at US$242 billion, and servicing it will still swallow up half of the government's income in 2024, according to the IMF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have criticised Islamabad's measures as surface-level reforms aimed at courting the IMF without addressing underlying problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to not see old patterns in this new IMF deal," said Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The IMF has issued a loan similar in size and conditions as the one agreed to five years ago, and five years before that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will authorities seize the opportunity thus created to embark on fundamental reforms to how the country is run?" he asked. "You would be well-advised not to hold your breath."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Sharif came to power in February elections marred by allegations of rigging, with ex-PM Imran Khan jailed and barred from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The diet of strict economic measures introduced by his shaky coalition government is likely to undermine their popularity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have already been scattered protests over tax and bill hikes introduced in last month's budget – prepared with IMF oversight – and more demonstrations are scheduled for the coming weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While around 40 percent of the population already lives below the poverty line, the World Bank said in April it feared that 10 million additional Pakistanis would fall below this threshold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's last US$3 billion loan from the IMF in 2023 proved a lifeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also came on the condition of unpopular austerity measures, including an end to subsidies cushioning consumer costs. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their upward climb on Friday, shrugging off disappointing inflation data and a poor response to bank earnings amid expectations of easing US monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US wholesale inflation rose 0.2 percent in June, more than expected, according to Labour Department data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Friday's data was not bad enough to overshadow Thursday's benign consumer price index report that boosted expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, analysts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.6 percent at 40,000, just shy of a closing record set in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 also gained 0.6 percent to 5,615, along with the Nasdaq, which closed at 18,398. Both indices had dropped on Thursday, ending a multi-day stretch of records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yesterday's decline appears to be a one-off and it's not leading to more selling," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments, who considers the current dynamics a bull market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit large bank after earnings was Wells Fargo, which sank 6.0 percent as it reported lower profits due in part to a decline in net interest income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase also fell more than one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The air taxi startup Archer Aviation soared 10.4 percent after announcing a partnership with Southwest Airlines to provide aircraft in California. Southwest rose 2.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AT&T shed 0.2 percent after disclosing a massive data breach in which hackers stole call and message data from virtually all of its customers for six months in 2022 – around 90 million people. (AFP)

    US producer inflation higher than anticipated in June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some analysts expect US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to announce an interest rate cut in September.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US wholesale prices picked up more than expected in June due to service costs, the government reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.2 percent last month, while an initially-reported decline in May was revised upwards, said the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures come after a cooler than expected consumer inflation reading, which fanned hopes of the US central bank cutting interest rates as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve has been battling to bring stubborn inflation back to its longer-term two percent target by keeping rates high, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has noted "modest" progress on prices recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, government data showed the consumer price index – a key gauge of inflation – rose 3.0 percent from a year ago, a slowdown from 3.3 percent in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said the latest PPI data is unlikely to worry the Fed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the PPI report, a 0.6 percent increase in services costs bumped the overall index higher, the Labour Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, PPI rose 2.6 percent in June, the largest gain since increasing 2.7 percent in March 2023, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an underlying measure stripping out food, energy and trade services was unchanged in June after a 0.2 percent rise in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some analysts expect the Fed could signal in its July meeting that it intends to lower rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although slightly hotter than expected, a modest rise in the producer price index for June still keeps input prices on a supportive path for cooler inflation prints ahead," said Ben Ayers, senior economist for Nationwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a media interview on Thursday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said: "I do think with the incoming information on inflation, growth and the labour market, some policy adjustments are likely to be warranted." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s exports rose at their fastest in 15 months in June, customs data showed Friday, while imports declined.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy grew 8.6 percent year-on-year in value last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That marked a third consecutive rise after a year-on-year decline in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports rose 6.9 percent in the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, however, hit a four-month low in June, shrinking 2.3 percent compared with a 1.8 percent rise the month before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports," Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s trade surplus last month reached US$99 billion, up from US$82.6 billion in May. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Nasdaq fell 2.0 percent as investors moved away from artificial intelligence stocks. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761248_1_20240712043453.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both fell on Thursday, snapping a multiday run of records as investors shifted towards underbought equities and away from artificial intelligence names.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pivot came as the yield on US Treasury bonds fell further amid rising expectations of interest rate cuts after better US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.1 percent at 39,753.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.9 percent to 5,584, while the Nasdaq fell 2.0 percent to 18,283, snapping a run of seven straight records on the tech-focused index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While two of the three indices finished in negative territory due to weakness in Nvidia, Apple and other tech equities that have led the market in 2024, analysts noted that the majority of equities moved higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What's being bought is the laggards," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's the start of a healthy rotation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, overall consumer prices declined 0.1 percent on-month for the first time since 2020, US data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The better-than-expected reading comes as markets increasingly wager that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets now see around an 85 percent chance of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Delta fell 3.9 percent after reporting a 29 percent drop in quarterly profits to US$1.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier scored record revenues for the June quarter but said it would temper plans to add capacity in the second half of 2024 due to moderating demand. American Airlines and United Airlines also fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla plunged 7.9 percent following a report that Elon Musk's electric auto giant will delay a much anticipated "robotaxi" event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unveiling was originally planned for August 8, but Tesla has pushed the event back until October to give teams more time, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the decision. (AFP)

    EU accepts Apple plan to let rivals access tap-to-pay

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Competitors will now be able to compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops in the EU. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761239_1_20240712004748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU on Thursday approved Apple's offer to allow rivals access to the iPhone's ability to tap-to-pay within the bloc, ending a lengthy probe and sparing it a heavy fine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The case dates back to 2022 when Brussels first accused Apple of blocking rivals from its popular iPhone tap payment system in a breach of EU competition law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones. Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding," EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to "tap-as-you-go" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes must remain in force for 10 years and a "monitoring trustee" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple had risked a fine of up to 10 percent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet," the company said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro (US$1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe. (AFP)

    US consumer inflation eases more than expected

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden issued a statement saying the report shows the US is making significant progress in fighting inflation. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761230_1_20240711215505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US inflation cooled more than expected in June, government data showed on Thursday, a positive development for President Joe Biden as he fights to win confidence on his economic record in his reelection bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.0 percent last month from a year ago, said the Labour Department, as a drop in petrol prices more than offset housing costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A measure stripping out volatile food and energy prices also saw the smallest annual rise since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's report shows that we are making significant progress fighting inflation," Biden said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While costs of cars and appliances are falling, he conceded that prices remain too high and pledged to "do everything I can for the working people that built our economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A consensus forecast of analysts initially expected consumer inflation at 3.1 percent, down from 3.3 percent in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy has been on a bumpy path to reining in inflation, which soared to a blistering 9.1 percent in mid-2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This prompted the central bank to rapidly hike interest rates in hopes of easing demand and bringing down price increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that there has since been "modest" progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, overall CPI declined 0.1 percent on-month for the first time since 2020, Labour Department data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "core" CPI index excluding the volatile food and energy was up 3.3 percent on-year, the smallest jump since April 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The improvement on the inflation front recently is good news for growth in real disposable income, which matters for consumer spending," said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that spending "hit a lull" in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest report adds to a series of encouraging data that could give officials confidence that inflation is coming down to their two-percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This, in turn, would allow them to start cutting decades-high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jobs market, another segment that Fed policymakers are monitoring, has also returned to a "strong, but not overheated" state, Powell said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A further deceleration in prices and labour market cooldown would "support a change in message from the Fed" at its July policy meeting, said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This could open the door to rate cuts as soon as the September meeting, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, said: "We still have a ways to go yet."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While shelter inflation has noticeably eased, he maintained that housing has been a major factor behind the stickiness of figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't see relief in the housing market for some period of time after the Fed starts to cut rates," he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if the Fed starts cutting in September, it's going to be months and months before we see enough significant movement in the 30-year mortgage to make a difference," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered higher on Wednesday with major indices finishing up more than one percent, hitting fresh records amid rising expectations for upcoming interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at all-time highs following comments from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank would not wait until inflation hit two percent before considering a rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Treasury bond yields retreated, with analysts citing strong demand at a 10-year Treasury note auction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones gained 1.1 percent to 38,921.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.0 percent to 5,633 for its sixth straight record, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.2 percent to 18,647 to end at its seventh straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell's remarks came in congressional testimony before a House panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum," Powell said. "If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spartan Capital's Peter Cardillo said the rally was notable one day before the market sees key new US consumer price data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Powell is basically telegraphing to the market that we are having a rate cut in September," Cardillo said. "That's what's behind the move here."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank will not want to wait for inflation to cool to its two percent target before considering a rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum," Powell said in testimony to the US House Financial Services Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long," he added. In such a scenario, inflation would go well below the target level – which is also an undesirable outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell was responding to a question on whether the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, would need to dip below two percent at least once in the coming months before officials contemplate rate reductions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank leader's comments come a day after he noted recent inflation readings have shown "modest" progress, adding that "more good data" would boost confidence that price increases are cooling sustainably.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To combat surging inflation, the Fed in recent years hiked the benchmark lending rate to a decades-high level in hopes of easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, policymakers have held rates at a 23-year high. While inflation has peaked, its downward progress has stalled somewhat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Powell told lawmakers that he is not yet prepared to express confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the Fed's political independence, Powell added that this is critical to the central bank's ability to do its job and sustain the faith of people across the political spectrum. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it would launch a formal probe looking into EU practices during an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce will conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the relevant practices adopted by the EU in its investigation of Chinese enterprises," the ministry said in a note on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministry officials said they had decided to launch the probe following a complaint made by the national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint mainly dealt with "products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment", according to the ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation will last from July 10 to January 10, 2025, and could be extended to April 10, 2025 under special conditions, the ministry said. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index rose just over 90 points, or about 0.5 percent, at the opening on Wednesday to trade at around 17,613.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the US is "no longer an overheated economy," remarks that suggested the case for rate cuts is strengthening. Some investors had anticipated the Fed chair, in his testimony to a Senate banking panel, might do more than he did to telegraph that a cut was on track for the central bank's September meeting.

  On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index opened down 0.35 percent at 2,949. The Component Index in Shenzhen also opened lower, falling 0.39 percent to 8,672 points in early trading. (with additional reporting from Reuters and Xinhua)

 Consumer price inflation on the mainland slowed in June, while producer price deflation persisted, as Beijing's support measures set a bumpy economic recovery in motion for the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) in June rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, against a 0.3 percent rise in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CPI edged down 0.2 percent month-on-month, versus a 0.1 percent drop in May and worsening from an expected 0.1 percent fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) fell 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, narrowing from a 1.4 percent decline the previous month, and matching a forecast 0.8 percent fall. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq edged to fresh records on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell reported "modest" progress in countering inflation ahead of the publication of influential US pricing data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," Powell told a Senate panel in remarks that kept alive hopes for potential interest rate cuts later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,291.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent to 5,576, while the Nasdaq also advanced 0.1 percent to 18,429, ending at a record for the sixth straight day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have seen the spate of recent records as reflecting a combination of still solid labour market data with improving inflation trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some market watchers think equities could be poised for a pullback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So much good news is already discounted in the market that it would be easy for it to get a bit of news that's negative and then correct," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. "It's gone so far so fast."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides key inflation data, this week's calendar includes a spate of earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other large banks, kicking off the second-quarter reporting season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Boeing fell 1.4 percent after reporting it delivered 44 planes in June, its best month so far in 2024. However, overall commercial plane deliveries for the second quarter still dropped by nearly one-third to 92.
  <br/>

  Tesla jumped 3.7 percent, rising for the 10th straight session amid anticipation of the company's presentation on "Robotaxis" next month. (AFP)

    Fed's Powell sees 'modest' progress on inflation

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve is making "modest" progress in its inflation fight, the head of the US central bank told lawmakers on Tuesday, on the first of two days of testimony in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  When prices surged in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Fed responded by hiking interest rates to a two-decade high as it attempts to cool down the US economy and return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation has eased significantly since it peaked in 2022, but progress stalled in the first quarter of this year, effectively putting the Fed's fight on pause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data in the second quarter has been more encouraging, prompting some cautious optimism from some policymakers in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to lawmakers in Washington, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said most recent readings "have shown some modest further progress" since the first quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," he added during his appearance in front of the Senate Banking Committee to discuss the Fed's semi-annual monetary policy report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell is likely to face tough questions from lawmakers on Tuesday – and again the following day in the House of Representatives – about the impact of the Fed's high interest rates on everyday Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is widely expected to remain on pause when it meets to set interest rates later this month, but could begin cutting rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures traders have assigned a probability of more than 75 percent that the Fed will make its first rate cut by mid-September, according to CME Group data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also see it as more likely than not that the Fed will make another quarter percentage-point cut by the end of the year. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The mainland's central bank on Tuesday announced that global investors will be given more choice of collateral for trading government bonds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will allow offshore investors to use onshore bonds under Northbound Bond Connect as margin collateral for Northbound Swap Connect transactions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bonds are limited to those issued by the Ministry of Finance and mainland policy banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the seventh anniversary of the launch of Bond Connect, Jiang Huifen from the PBOC said the new move will reduce the cost for overseas investors to trade mainland bonds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is going to help further expand the application of renminbi bonds as eligible offshore collateral. It will facilitate overseas institutions to hold renminbi bonds, reducing the costs of overseas institutional investors to join Swap Connect. This initiative will be jointly prepared with Hong Kong and will be launched as soon as possible," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's market regulators and the stock exchange operator welcomed the PBOC's new initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said it plans to implement the new measure by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission said they will guide financial infrastructure institutions to take forward the preparatory work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This measure will provide Northbound Swap Connect investors with the additional choice of non-cash collateral, reducing their liquidity cost and improving capital efficiency. It will also help vitalise offshore investors' onshore bond holdings and further enhance the attractiveness of onshore bonds," an HKMA spokesperson said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street ended mixed, with traders focused on inflation data out later in the week and testimony from Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended mixed on Monday as investors awaited fresh inflation data, commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the start of quarterly earnings season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 5.66 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,572.85, the Nasdaq Composite gained 50.98 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,403.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.08 points, or 0.1 percent, to 39,344.79.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and other chipmakers rose, lifting the Philadelphia semiconductor index about 2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders will scrutinize consumer price data due on Thursday and producer price data expected on Friday to gauge the Fed's progress in fighting inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors worry that waiting too long to cut interest rates could damage the labor market and push the economy into a recession. They will closely monitor Powell's semiannual testimony before US Senate and House committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What investors want to hear is a dovish tone and an acknowledgement that the two-sided risks are more evenly balanced today, in particular, with respect to the labour market," said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations for interest rate cuts as early as September grew after Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed US job growth slowed in June - the latest data to point to weakness in labour market conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a greater than 75 percent chance of a rate cut of at least 25 basis points by September, up from last week's 60 percent, according to CME's FedWatch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are slated to kick off Wall Street's second-quarter earnings season on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paramount Global fell after it agreed on Sunday to merge with Skydance Media, scripting a new chapter for one of Hollywood's oldest studios.

    New BYD plant in Turkey eyes EU market

    <![CDATA[<img alt="BYD plans to open a production facility and a research and development centre in Turkey. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760778_1_20240709005335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland electric vehicle giant BYD on Monday signed a US$1 billion agreement with Turkey to open a plant in the country in a move that would help it dodge new EU tariffs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The signing ceremony in Istanbul between BYD's CEO Wang Chuanfu and Turkey's industry and technology minister Fatih Kacir was overseen by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Turkish industry and technology ministry, BYD will open a production facility with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles as well as a research and development centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant will provide direct employment for 5,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news comes days after the European Union slapped additional provisional tariffs of up to 38 percent on Chinese EVs following an investigation that concluded state subsidies meant they were unfairly undermining European rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish-made cars enjoy beneficial access to the EU under a customs union that dates to 1995 and the Marmara region around Istanbul has become one of the leading centres of the world's automobile industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major carmakers including Fiat and Renault opened plants there at the beginning of the 1970s, with others like Ford, Toyota and Hyundai following, taking advantage of Turkey's position at the crossroads between Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The land that was previously allocated for Volkswagen in Manisa in the north of the Western porty city of Izmir would be given to the Chinese company, the daily newspaper Yeni Safak reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BYD is the world's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles and one of the most advanced in terms of technology and manufacturing quality," independent consultant Levent Taylan told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, this will be an investment for the Turkish market but especially European market, by circumventing the customs tariffs imposed on vehicles of Chinese origin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said BYD has a potential to sell around 20,000-25,000 vehicles per year on the Turkish market and export 75,000 to the EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under new Turkish regulations on investment incentives BYD will be able to circumvent a new 40 percent tariff that Turkey imposed on electric vehicle imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has led the global shift to electric vehicles, with almost one in three cars on its roads set to be electric by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency's annual Global EV Outlook. (AFP)

    Boeing reaches settlement with regulators over crashes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing's compliance measures and safety have been in the spotlight after a series of incidents, including two 737 MAX crashes. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760776_1_20240709002048.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing said on Monday it had reached a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, which court papers show would see the aviation giant plead guilty to fraud.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department," Boeing told AFP in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of crash victims immediately filed an objection to the deal, arguing that it "unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine Berthet, who lost her daughter Camille in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in 2019 -- involving a 737 MAX 8 -- said the deal reflects "weakness and manifest contempt for the victims' families and public interest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Court papers filed in Texas on Sunday said the company had agreed to plead guilty to "conspiracy to defraud the United States" during the certification of MAX airplanes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plea deal sees Boeing avoid a criminal trial, instead agreeing to a series of terms including a US$243.6 million fine on top of the same sum already paid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company will also be required to make a minimum investment of US$455 million in "compliance and safety programs".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such changes at the firm will be overseen by an independent monitor appointed by the government for a three-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's board of directors will also be required to meet the families of crash victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-profile agreement follows the DOJ finding in May that Boeing failed to improve its compliance and ethics program, in breach of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in the wake of the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The families of victims will ask the court to reject the plea deal at an upcoming hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises," said the objection filed by their legal team Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement shared by her lawyers, Berthet added that the agreement shows the DOJ's "deafness" despite an alarming rise in incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing flouted its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conclusion opened up the company to possible prosecution, with Boeing initially arguing it did not violate the 2021 accord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DOJ representatives briefed families in late June on the proposed plea deal and the company was given until July 5 to accept the offer, or face trial. (AFP)

    Japanese pay rises at its fastest pace in 31 years

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Base pay, or regular pay, rose an average 2.5 percent in May from a year earlier. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760662_1_20240708105146.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Average base pay for Japanese workers rose in May at its fastest pace in 31 years, data showed on Monday, a sign that bumper pay hikes offered by companies in annual wage negotiations are gradually being passed onto households.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But inflation-adjusted real wages fell for a record 26th straight month as a weakening yen and higher commodity prices pushed up the cost of imports, complicating the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) efforts to normalise monetary policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Base pay, or regular pay, rose an average 2.5 percent in May from a year earlier, the fastest pace since January 1993, around the time when Japan's asset bubble burst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rise, which was bigger than a revised 1.6 percent gain in April, reflected hefty rises in monthly pay agreed by labour and management at annual labour negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The data highlights Japan's increasing wage momentum. While real wages continue to fall, they will likely start rising in July," said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nominal wages, or the average total cash earnings per worker, grew 1.9 percent to 297,151 yen (US$1,850), accelerating from the previous month's 1.6 percent gain to mark the highest year-on-year increase in 11 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when adjusted for inflation, wages fell 1.4 percent in May after a revised 1.2 percent decline in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were signs that Japan's intensifying labour shortage is leading to broader-based wage rises. Wage hikes at firms with 30 or more employees outpaced inflation for the first time in 26 months, though when very small firms with five or more workers were included, pay hikes still lagged inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hourly pay for part-time workers rose 4.0 percent in May from a year earlier, outpacing a 2.7 percent gain for full-time staff. (Reuters)

    Workers at Samsung 'begin three-day strike'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Workers at South Korean tech giant Samsung began a three-day general strike Monday, the head of a union representing tens of thousands of employees told AFP, after talks with management broke down.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The strike has started from today," Son Woo-mok, head of the National Samsung Electronics Union, told AFP, adding that a major rally was scheduled later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union, which has around 28,000 members, or more than a fifth of the company's total workforce, announced the three-day general strike last week, saying it was a last resort after talks broke down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows a one-day walkout in June, the first such collective action at the company, which went decades without unionisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Management at the firm, the world's biggest producer of memory chips, has been locked in negotiations with the union over wages and benefits since January but the two sides have failed to narrow their differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now at critical crossroads," the union said in an appeal sent out to members last week, urging them to support the "critical" strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This strike is the last card we can use," the union said, saying that workers at the company needed to "act as one".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This strike is not just about improving working conditions, it is about taking back our rights that have been ignored so far," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers have rejected the offer of a 5.1 percent pay hike, with the union having previously outlined demands including improvements to annual leave and transparent performance-based bonuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung declined a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung Electronics avoided its employees unionising for almost 50 years -- sometimes adopting ferocious tactics, according to critics -- while rising to become the world's largest smartphone and semiconductor manufacturer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Company founder Lee Byung-chul, who died in 1987, was adamantly opposed to unions, saying he would never allow them "until I have dirt over my eyes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first labour union at Samsung Electronics was formed in the late 2010s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm is the flagship subsidiary of South Korean giant Samsung Group, by far the largest of the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate business in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is world's largest memory chip maker, and accounts for a significant chunk of global output of the high-end chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samsung recently predicted a 15-fold increase in its on-year second quarter operating profits, thanks to growing demand for generative AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductors are the lifeblood of the global economy, used in everything from kitchen appliances and mobile phones to cars and weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And demand for the advanced chips that power AI systems has skyrocketed thanks to the success of ChatGPT and other generative AI products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductors are South Korea's leading export and hit US$11.7 billion in March, their highest level in almost two years, accounting for a fifth of South Korea's total exports, according to figures released by the trade ministry. (AFP)

    Hong Kong to surpass Switzerland by 2027: Hui

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, said Hong Kong will surpass Switzerland to become the world's largest wealth management hub by 2027.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui said Hong Kong’s appeal in attracting foreign investments has been growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR will continue to improve service quality, noting that the government’s proposals to simplify the process of changing the place of incorporation to Hong Kong will attract overseas companies to establish or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On July 3, the government published new legislative proposals for a regulatory framework that makes it easier for overseas companies to re-domicile in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These proposals include relaxing the requirement for financial statement submission and extending the de-registration period from 60 to 120 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current government term, Hui said Hong Kong's attractiveness to foreign businesses would persist with its low tax rates and relaxed compliance requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In overseas jurisdictions, there have been more requirements for companies to register a place of incorporation. These requirements primarily focus on compliance, such as the need for local economic activities and specific operations. Some companies might enjoy lower compliance requirements or even lower tax rates in these places in the past,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the introduction of a global minimum tax rate and the rising compliance requirements, these incentives are dwindling. So, this has become a driving factor that encourages them to return to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stopped short on predicting the number of companies that would re-domicile to Hong Kong, but stressed a need to establish a suitable platform and framework in advance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business remained resilient despite geopolitical headwinds last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said assets under management stood at more than HK$31 trillion in 2023, up about 2.1 per cent year-on-year, with two-thirds of the assets coming from outside the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that the SAR remained the second largest private equity management centre after the mainland, with private equity fund assets exceeding HK$1.7 trillion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The above figures show that despite the changing international geopolitical situation, investors still have confidence in the prospects of the mainland and Hong Kong markets," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is important for us to do our job well and continue to explain how the country is steadily improving, the central government's strong support for Hong Kong and the unique benefits under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the city's flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, had announced that it would buy back the remaining preference shares from the government this month, showing that the aviation industry was moving towards full normalcy.

    Deadline looms for beleaguered Boeing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are assembled at the company’s plant in Renton, Washington. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760474_1_20240706084446.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than five years after two fatal 737 MAX crashes, Boeing faces a fresh legal reckoning now that prosecutors have concluded the company flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The aviation giant had been on a Friday night deadline to accept or reject a Department of Justice proposal that would require it to plead guilty to fraud during the certification of MAX airplanes, sources told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been no public comment either way by the evening, and a lawyer for the families of the 737 crash victims, Robert Clifford, told AFP that he believed the deadline would be extended over the weekend if Boeing asked for more time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest legal predicament was triggered by a DOJ determination in mid-May that the company ignored a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) by not meeting requirements to improve its compliance and ethics program after the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under a proposal presented by the DOJ to families of MAX crash victims, Boeing would pay an additional US$243 million penalty and agree to have an external monitor, said Tracy Brammeier, an attorney at Clifford Law who represents families of MAX victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The guilty plea is significant. No one wants to be a convicted or admitted felon," said Brammeier, who nonetheless described family members as dissatisfied with the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a US court on how it will proceed no later than July 7, with the agency expected to announce steps to prosecute Boeing should the company reject the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing, which has previously said it honoured the terms of the DPA, declined comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021 near the end of the Trump administration over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification of the MAX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year. But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing breached its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of victims, who have pressed for a criminal trial of Boeing and its top executives, remain unhappy that the new plea agreement does not explicitly link Boeing's fraud to the 346 fatalities from crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, according to Brammeier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The families want accountability and still are not getting it," Brammeier said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash, said the DOJ should also impose much stiffer fines on Boeing -- from US$10 billion to US$20 billion -- with the caveat that they could be suspended if the company invests in safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's too good a deal for Boeing," said Stumo, who added that Boeing should not have a say in who is appointed its independent monitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, said the DOJ's decision to stick with the original charge -- rather than supplement it -- reflects a desire to "bring the claims that could be most easily proven if it goes to trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said DPAs like Boeing's often "poorly serve" the public interest because "prosecutors probably care much more about achieving a conviction than ensuring the defendant is adequately deterred and restrained," he wrote in a blog post this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coffee suggested the DOJ should consider measures such as barring CEO compensation models that encourage risk-taking, or ensuring that funds clawed back from executives who plead guilty of wrongdoing go to whistleblowers as a way "to shift some of the cost of deterrence from shareholders to senior management." (AFP)

    Canada's jobless rate hits 29-month high

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rising unemployment has fuelled concerns about the Canadian economy. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760452_1_20240705232143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada's unemployment rate rose to a 29-month high of 6.4 percent, data showed on Friday, highlighting that people might be losing jobs as the labour market struggles to absorb a rapidly swelling population.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jobs report, which also showed that youth unemployment reached almost a decade high barring the pandemic years, prompted money markets to increase bets of a rate cut by the Bank of Canada (BoC) this month to around 56 percent from 40 percent a day earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists pointed out that the rising unemployment rate could be indicating that Canada is flirting with recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A sustained deterioration is typically only seen during recessions," Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note, pointing to the 1.4-percentage-point rise in the jobless rate since January last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that if the jobless figure was considered independently, it was likely that the central bank would cut rates in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada lost a net 1,400 jobs in June, Statistics Canada said, against analysts' predictions of 22,500 job gains, in further indications of weakness in economic conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group, said the sharp rise in the unemployment rate will have many questioning whether Canada has entered a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Lowering interest rates is the only way to soften the blow from upcoming mortgage renewals and keep any hope of a soft landing alive," he said, adding that the BoC would cut rates by 25 basis points this month and another two rate cuts in the three meetings thereafter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said last month that the labour market had cooled reasonably in recent months, and that achieving the central bank's goal of cooling inflation did not need to involve a sharp rise in unemployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was even room for economic growth and jobs creation without imperiling the bank's target of 2 percent inflation, the governor said. (Reuters)

    US job gains ease as unemployment edges higher

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Weak jobs data suggests the US economy is cooling steadily. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760448_1_20240705224017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US job gains eased slightly in June while unemployment edged up, government data showed on Friday, in a sign that the world's biggest economy is cooling steadily.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wage growth decelerated, although it still outpaced consumer inflation. But this has not translated into rosy sentiment over the broader economy, adding to President Joe Biden's challenges as he seeks re-election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country added 206,000 jobs last month, the US Labour Department said, marking a slower pace of hiring than May's revised 218,000 figure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gains still beat a Briefing.com consensus estimate of 185,000, signalling that the labour market remains relatively resilient despite high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jobless rate ticked up from 4.0 percent to 4.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, the figures point to a "very gradual, orderly cooling" in the market, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she pointed to signs of weakness, including downward revisions to April and May hiring numbers by a cumulative 111,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The uptick in unemployment, though narrow, also marks the highest level since November 2021 – ending a 30-month stretch where the rate stood at or below 4.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than one-third of overall gains came from government employment, noted Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. This means that headline gains do not paint a full picture of the labor market's health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other aspects of the data indicate a slowing job market," he said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temporary hires dropped by 49,000, indicating that business demand for labour is falling, Fratantoni said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wage growth slowed from 0.4 percent in May to 0.3 percent last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compared with a year ago, the increase was 3.9 percent – also easing from before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Weakening demand for labour will lead to further moderation in wage growth," said economist Nancy Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this is likely to bolster the US Federal Reserve's confidence that inflation is on a downward path to policymakers' 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest report comes on the back of a slump in activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, alongside easing inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While there is some way to go, these indicators will likely give the US central bank more confidence to begin cutting interest rates after holding them at a high level in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This move could, in turn, give the economy a boost. (AFP)

    Govt to tender one residential site this quarter

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday announced that it will put only one residential site up for tender this quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A plot at Shiu Lek Yuen in Sha Tin is expected to generate 570 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the authorities will not be selling any commercial sites this quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is also a hard fact that the vacancy rate for the commercial floor area in the economy is now on the high side. According to some recent statistics, it is around 13 percent. So, taking into account the market condition, we think we have a reason not to roll out commercial sites in this quarter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also said the government's land sales, private property developments and urban renewal projects in the first two quarters will provide a total of 4,065 housing units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will meet around one-third of the target of 13,200 units for this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to sell a total of eight residential sites this financial year, including six unsold sites from the previous land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Lands Department, only one piece of land was sold between April and June. The plot, which went for almost HK$82 million, will be used for a charging station for electric vehicles.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Trading volumes were extremely low ahead of the July 4th holiday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760160_1_20240704021559.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq again finished at fresh records on Wednesday, extending a positive run following mixed economic data in a quiet holiday-shortened session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US private-sector hiring came in a bit below expectations for June, while a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed a surprise contraction in services industry activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are looking ahead to Friday's jobs report, said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, adding that the labour market seems to be "normalising but not collapsing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan described trading volumes as extremely low ahead of the July 4th holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 5,537, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.9 percent to 18,188.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones meanwhile lost 0.1 percent at 39,308.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Southwest Airlines advanced 1.6 percent after announcing a shareholder rights plan designed to prevent Elliott Investment Management from gaining a controlling stake in the carrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paramount Global jumped 6.9 percent following reports that it reached a deal to be bought by movie studio Skydance after earlier breaking off the talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Constellation Brands dropped 3.8 percent after reporting a 22 percent jump in quarterly profits to US$877 million behind strong beer sales. However, net sales in wine and spirits fell. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks jumped on Tuesday, lifting major indices to fresh records, following comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that boosted the odds for interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,509, a fresh record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq gained 0.8 percent to 18,028, also a record, while the Dow Jones advanced 0.4 percent to 39,331.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell's upbeat comments came at a panel discussion with other central bankers in Portugal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've made quite a bit of progress in bringing inflation back down to our target, while the labour market has remained strong and growth has continued," Powell said. "We want that process to continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell "said just enough to get the traders excited as he always does," said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. "Powell most always tends toward the dovish side or typically says something neutral, but traders take the part that they like to hear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Tesla shot up more than 10 percent after reporting lower auto sales in the second quarter that still topped expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures fuelled talk that Elon Musk's automaker is poised to rebound after a tough period for electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets will close early on Wednesday for the Independence Day holiday before reopening on Friday, when the market will digest US jobs data for June. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The 11.5 percent drop comes after a 14.7 percent fall in April and a 7 percent decrease in March. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759954_1_20240702171037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales dropped by 11.5 percent in May compared with the same month last year, extending a losing streak to three months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that sales slid to HK$30.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drop came after a 14.7 percent fall in April and a 7 percent decrease in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government blamed the latest slump on changes in spending patterns of visitors and residents, as well as the strength of the Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said a recent increase in duty-free allowances for mainland visitors should help local retailers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The retail sector may still face some challenges in the near term. However, the Central Government's recently announced measures benefitting Hong Kong, including the further enhanced Individual Visit Scheme and the increase of duty-free allowance for luggage articles for mainland resident visitors, should help stimulate retail businesses," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that the authorities will continue to stimulate the local economy and market sentiment by hosting mega events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an online press call, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said retails sales are expected to continue falling in July and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that the market will remain sluggish for the second half of this year, considering the speedy business downturn, together with high rent and manpower costs," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other economic factors, such as the strong Hong Kong dollar, also pose challenges to the retail industry. The difficult situation is expected to continue for some time."
