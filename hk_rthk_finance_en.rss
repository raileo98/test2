    Fresh data signals weakness in US jobs market

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A “Help Wanted” sign hangs in a restaurant window in Medford, Massachusetts. There are now signs that the US jobs market is weakening as new claims for unemployment benefits climb. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757342_1_20240613224642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a 10-month high last week, suggesting the labour market was losing momentum and keeping hopes of a September interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve alive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was reinforced by other data from the Labour Department on Thursday showing producer prices unexpectedly falling in May. The largest decline in prices at the factory gate since last October followed news on Wednesday that consumer prices were unchanged in May. The US central bank on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25 percent-5.5 percent range, where it has been since last July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with policymakers projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists, however, remained optimistic that the Fed would reduce borrowing costs twice this year, starting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These data nudge the door a little wider open for the Fed to start cutting interest rates later this year," said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 242,000 for the week ended June 8, the highest level since last August, the Labour Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 claims in the latest week. It was the third straight weekly rise in claims, leading some economists to believe that cracks were forming in the labour market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others blamed the rise on lingering volatility related to the Memorial Day holiday in late May. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of Tencent-backed QuantumPharm, also known as XtalPi, on Thursday surged during its trading debut in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It marks the first initial public offering (IPO) under the Hong Kong stock exchange's Chapter 18C listing regime which allows specialist technology companies with a minimum valuation of HK$10 billion to sell shares, even if they haven't generated profits yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shares of the artificial intelligence drug researcher closed at HK$5.8, nearly 10 percent above its IPO price of HK$5.28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Public investors oversubscribed the offer by 102 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the listing ceremony, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Chapter 18C listing regime could facilitate financing for tech companies in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre enables it to attract global capital which in turn supports technology development in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, described the listing as a significant milestone in the city's market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added it showcased China’s leading role in the innovation and technology field and Hong Kong's appeal as a global financing hub for the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to the listing, Image Frame, a Tencent subsidiary, had a stake of about 13 percent in the newly-listed company.

    HKMA tracks Fed's decision and keeps rate steady

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The HKMA says the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757245_2_20240613115320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday left its base rate unchanged at 5.75 percent, tracking a decision by the US Federal Reserve to keep its key lending rate steady.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the benchmark interest rate between 5.25 and 5.5 percent, and said there is likely to be only one cut, of a quarter of a percentage point, this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an online press call, Mackie Lau, Standard Chartered's co-Head of Treasury Markets in Greater China, North Asia and Hong Kong, said the Fed's decision to keep the rate unchanged was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said there is no rush for the Fed to start cutting rates, as there are indications of resilience in the US economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the Fed's perspective, I think they do want to see inflation completely under control, and they would take a lot more comfort to act when the time comes. So I think at this juncture, the market is kind of expecting the first cut to come in September. That is very much in line with the dot plot that was released last night," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said that with recent economic data showing mixed signs and inflation remaining high, it's uncertain when the Fed will start cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that Hong Kong's financial and monetary markets continue to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading local banks, including HSBC, Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Standard Chartered, announced they were keeping their rates unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Sze-kei, Head of Wealth Strategy and Insights Division at Bank of China (Hong Kong), said the Fed's decision to maintain its interest rates was to prevent a sharp rebound in US inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung explained that while inflation in the US had been on a downward trajectory, the local job market and economy displayed strength, demonstrating resilience in inflationary pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, Cheung said the Fed had adopted a prudent approach in managing interest rates.

    Stop turning trade into a political issue: Mofa

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Xinhua commentary says the EU should embrace competition as an impetus for its own development. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757238_1_20240613112719.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry has urged the European Commission to stop turning trade into a political issue and avoid harming mutual trust between China and the European Union, as shares in Chinese automakers ended on a mostly positive note on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The comment from the Foreign Ministry came as the European Commission announced it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported electric cars from China starting in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will take all necessary measures to counter these actions, spokesperson Lin Jian told a news conference in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency had earlier said the move by the EU violates the rights and interests of the nation's EV industry and wreaks havoc on the global automotive supply chain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a commentary published late on Wednesday, Xinhua said "the EU's justification for these tariffs are based on claims of unfair competition due to so-called 'distortive' Chinese government subsidies. However, this claim is nothing but a thinly veiled excuse for protectionism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after Washington announced plans to quadruple duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would combat excessive subsidies with additional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes as European automakers are being challenged by an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. Still, there's virtually no support for tariffs from the European auto industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German automakers in particular are heavily dependent on sales in China and fear retribution from Beijing. European auto firms also import their own Chinese-made vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xinhua commentary continued by saying the EU should instead "embrace this competition as an impetus for its own development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that rather than imposing tariffs, the EU should seek collaborative solutions that benefit all parties involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, shares in BYD shot up more than five percent on Thursday on the Hang Seng Index, where carmakers NIO and Geely also ended the day 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent higher. SAIC was down more than 1.5 percent in Shanghai. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted record closing highs for a third straight day on Wednesday after inflation data came in softer than expected but the indexes ended off the day's highs as the Federal Reserve projected only one interest rate cut this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fed's March projections included three quarter-percentage-point reductions. The US central bank, in a statement at the end of its June 11-12 meeting, also said it left its policy rate unchanged, as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks were choppy following the news and press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq paring gains late and the Dow finishing near flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks opened higher after the Labour Department reported that the US Consumer Price Index was unexpectedly unchanged in May due to cheaper gasoline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The CPI number was certainly cooler than estimates and drove optimism to start the day but that was only half of today's menu," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James said he would have expected the market to end weaker after the Fed's update, noting that "the commentary was hawkish and rate cut (expectations) were trimmed from three to one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oracle shares jumped 13.3 percent, lifting the market, after the software provider forecast double-digit revenue in fiscal 2025 after the bell on Tuesday.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just after the CPI report, traders boosted bets for a Fed rate cut by September and another by December.

    Fed holds rates, expects one cut this year

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Fed says interest rate cuts may have to wait until December. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757188_1_20240613021431.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with officials projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for the year amid rising estimates for what it will take to keep inflation in check.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The markdown in the outlook for rate cuts, from three quarter-percentage-point reductions seen in the Fed's March projections, was made despite the central bank's acknowledgement in its new policy statement of "modest further progress" towards its 2 percent inflation target – an upgrade from its May 1 statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It coincided with an increase to 2.8 percent in the estimated long-run, or "neutral," rate of interest, from 2.6 percent, which indicates policymakers have concluded the economy needs more restraint in order to finish the battle against rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent progress has been slow, and Fed officials now project a slightly higher end-of-year inflation rate of 2.6 percent versus the 2.4 percent anticipated as of March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rate cuts are now seen getting a likely later start and a slower pace this year than investors have anticipated, the Fed's policy rate is seen falling fast next year, with reductions of a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement and new Summary of Economic Projections show a central bank wrestling over how to respond to data that many read as pointing to slower inflation –consumer prices in fact did not rise at all in May on a month-over-month basis, according to data released on Wednesday – but also to steady growth and job creation.

    Beijing rebukes additional EU tariffs on Chinese EVs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China vowed to protect its interests if the EU goes ahead with its tariffs on Chinese EVs. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757113_1_20240612162215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday criticised additional European Union tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), saying the move violated market economy principles and international trade rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  MOFA spokesperson Lin Jian said any additional tariffs on Chinese EVs would eventually undermine the EU's own interests, adding Beijing would take all necessary measures to protect its lawful rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's comments came ahead of an announcement by the European Commission that it would apply additional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after the United States quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would set tariffs of 17.4 percent for BYD, 20 percent for Geely and 38.1 percent for SAIC over what it said were excessive subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU provisional duties are set to apply by July 4, with an anti-subsidy investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could apply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Margaritis Schinas, a European Commission vice president, told a news conference that Chinese-built cars were benefiting from unfair levels of subsidies, threatening EU producers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On this basis the Commission has reached out to Chinese authorities to discuss these findings and explore possible ways for resolving the issues identified," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China is strongly dissatisfied with the European plan to impose provisional duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, saying the move ignored facts and World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said Beijing will resolutely take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese companies. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said a tie-up between a government-owned investment vehicle and a local tech unicorn will add momentum to Hong Kong's securities market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Corporation has signed a cooperation deal with SmartMore, a technology company specialising in artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The collaboration between Hong Kong Corporation and SmartMore is a good starting point for advancing Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry towards a brighter future," Chan said in a speech at the signing ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the upcoming months, the Hong Kong Investment Corporation will continue to announce more strategic partnerships and actively pursue direct investments and joint investment projects. These projects will encompass various fields, including life sciences, green technology, and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said Hong Kong spent HK$30.1 billion on research and development in 2022, up from HK$21.3 billion in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that there were 4,250 tech startups in Hong Kong last year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An insider trading case against Asian hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its British founder Simon Sadler and a former trader has been moved to the District Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Eastern Magistrates' Court approved the prosecution’s request to transfer the case to a higher court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next hearing is scheduled to take place at the District Court on July 2, the court ruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum prison term a district court judge can impose is seven years, versus two to three years for the magistrate's court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case marks a turning point for one of Asia's biggest and oldest hedge funds as well as a step toward heightened scrutiny of trading activities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said last month it had started criminal proceedings against Segantii, its founder and chief investment officer Sadler and former trader Daniel La Rocca on suspicion of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company before a block trade in June 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accusation relates to insider information about Hong Kong-listed fashion chain Esprit Holdings, the court readout revealed, adding Segantii received the information from Tony Psarianos, a person connected to Esprit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psarianos was an investment banker at Merrill Lynch from 2007 to 2021, according to SFC licence records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, dubbed Asia's "block trade king", is also the owner of his home-town soccer team, Blackpool Football Club. (Reuters)

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757051_1_20240612103958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation held steady in May while producer price declines eased, but the underlying trend suggests Beijing would need to do more to prop up weakened domestic demand and an uneven economic recovery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in May from a year earlier, matching a gain in April, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slide in the producer price index eased to 1.4 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, compared with a forecast 1.5 percent decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's economy has struggled to gain traction despite the end of stringent pandemic curbs in late 2022, mainly due to the ripple effects of a prolonged property sector crisis on investor, business and consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has rolled out several measures to spur demand in the housing sector and launched other schemes to boost consumer sentiment, including offering government-subsidised incentives to spur trade-ins of cars and other consumer goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also vowed to create more jobs linked to major projects, roll out measures to promote domestic demand targeted for youths and has pledged greater fiscal stimulus to shore up growth. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered record closing highs for a second straight day on Tuesday, helped by a gain of more than 7 percent in Apple shares, while investors also awaited consumer prices data and a policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apple shares jumped 7.3 percent to a record-high close and gave the S&P 500 and Nasdaq their biggest boosts after the stock declined in the previous session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At its annual developer event that kicked off on Monday, Apple unveiled new artificial-intelligence features meant to increase the appeal of its devices, including an improved Siri virtual assistant that can answer a wider range of queries and accomplish more complicated tasks than earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 technology index climbed 1.7 percent and also posted a record closing high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Price Index report will be released before the bell on Wednesday, and the US central bank's policy announcement is due later the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank is likely to leave interest rates unchanged but will release its updated economic projections and "dot plot," which shows where policymakers expect interest rates to stand this year and longer-term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everybody is feeling uneasy, but the data and actions consumers are taking continue to point toward resiliency, and that tends to be overall fairly bullish," said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and adviser for Wealthspire Advisors in Westport, Connecticut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31 percent, to 38,747, the S&P 500 gained  0.27 percent, to 5,375 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.88 percent, to 17,344.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  General Motors gained 1.35 percent after the carmaker announced a US$6 billion share buyback plan. GM also cut its annual EV production forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the closing bell, Oracle shares rose 8 percent following the release of quarterly results. The stock ended the regular session down 0.5 percent. (Reuters)

 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday eked out record closing highs, although investors were cautious ahead of this week's consumer prices report, a Federal Reserve policy announcement and Apple's developer conference.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Providing some support to the Nasdaq and S&P 500, Nvidia shares ended up 0.7 percent, the session after a 10-for-one stock split. Some investors now believe the chip-maker might be included in the blue-chip Dow.

  The Consumer Price Index report for May is due on Wednesday, along with the conclusion of the Fed's two-day policy meeting.

  The central bank, which will release updated economic and policy projections, is expected to hold interest rates steady. Investors will look for clues on when the US central bank may begin to cut interest rates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The euro recoiled on Monday after a far-right surge in weekend EU polls sparked a general election in France, although analysts believe the single currency will remain resilient.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shared eurozone unit was down 0.3 percent at US$1.0736 around 1415 GMT, while the Paris CAC 40 stocks index slumped 1.9 percent in shock over President Emmanuel Macron's election call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors fretted over the region's political "shift to the Far Right," as well as the "surprise factor" of a snap general election in France, according to XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron announced on Sunday that he was dissolving the National Assembly, or French Parliament's lower house, after news that far-right parties including National Rally (NR) took almost 40 percent of the French vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NR is led by 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella, whose mentor is Marine Le Pen – runner-up in the last two presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France will vote for a new National Assembly on June 30 with a second round scheduled on July 7, two years after Macron failed to clinch an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The euro took a hit as investors fretted that political turmoil could hurt Macron's agenda in in France, which was a key founding member of the eurozone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The prospect of a parliament controlled by Le Pen and Bardella with Macron as president, could thwart Macron's plans for much-needed economic reforms in France that could have eased concerns about... debt," said Brooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those concerns were brought into sharp focus after Standard and Poor's recently downgraded France's long-term sovereign debt rating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Added to the mix, the July election could deliver a far-right prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The likelihood (is) that parliamentary elections in France will result in a PM from another party," said Rabobank analyst Jane Foley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This would change the direction of French politics including the agenda with respect to fiscal policy and potentially for issues such as EU enlargement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increasing popularity of far-right parties has also stoked concerns over rising euroscepticism in the continent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going forward, commentators warn that could further weigh on the euro, which was created in 1999 as a key means of bringing the continent closer together. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said a government-owned investment vehicle will sign a cooperation deal on Wednesday with a local "tech unicorn" – a start-up company worth more than US$1 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan did not name the company concerned, but said it operated in the artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the tie-up with Hong Kong Investment Corporation will help the business expand research and development investment here, as well as fund training of staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said the deal would help the company roll out the use of its AI models in the Greater Bay Area and speed up digital transformation in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the purpose of the corporation is to help promote innovation and technology in Hong Kong by attracting enterprises and professionals with high potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the number of tech start-ups in the city exceeded 4,250 last year.

    US stocks finish lower after choppy session

    <![CDATA[<img alt="For the week, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 percent, the Nasdaq rose 2.38 percent, and the Dow added 0.29 percent. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756581_1_20240608045238.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks ended slightly lower on Friday in choppy trading after stronger-than-expected US jobs data pointed to a robust economy but prompted worries the Federal Reserve may wait longer to cut interest rates than many investors had hoped.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy generated about 272,000 jobs in May, far more than the 185,000 analysts had forecast, according to a Labour Department report. The unemployment rate inched up to 4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The benchmark S&P 500 slipped immediately after the report while US Treasury yields climbed as traders slashed bets on a September rate reduction. The index recovered and briefly hit a fresh intraday record high as investors noted the data pointed to underlying economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It finished slightly lower, with the utilities, materials, and communication services stocks among the biggest drag. Financials and technology advanced ahead of others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the week, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 percent, the Nasdaq rose 2.38 percent, and the Dow added 0.29 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This tells you there's certainly not going to a cut in the short term, and with the bond yields going back up it's putting a lot of pressure on the risk-on trade, which is probably small caps," said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's just a function of interest rates and maybe a little higher for longer, and people have to recalibrate for that type of environment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a 56 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Investors will eye US inflation data next week and the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which ends on June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one expects the Fed to cut (rates next week), but will they open the door for a cut as soon as September is the big question on everyone's mind," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, adding he still sees a September reduction on the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.22 percent, to 38,798, the S&P 500 lost 0.11 percent, to 5,346 and the Nasdaq lost 0.23 percent, to 17,133.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop slumped 39 percent in volatile trading just as stock influencer "Roaring Kitty" kicked off his first livestream in three years. The gaming retailer had announced a potential stock offering and a drop in quarterly sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other so-called meme stocks, including AMC Entertainment and Koss Corp, fell 15.1 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia slipped, on track to extend the previous session's losses, with its valuation again dipping below the US$3 trillion mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lyft shares rose 0.6 percent, following a forecast of 15 percent annual growth in its gross bookings through 2027 after markets closed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 1,177 stocks rose and 3,064 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.6-to-1 ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 149 new lows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total volume of shares traded across US exchanges was about 10.75 billion, compared with the 12.7 billion average over the last 20 trading days. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden says the jobs report is a sign of the economy’s robust health. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756572_1_20240608011135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 America’s employers added a strong 272,000 jobs in May, accelerating from April and a sign that companies are still confident enough in the economy to keep hiring despite persistently high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last month’s sizeable job gain suggests that the economy is still growing steadily, propelled by consumer spending on travel, entertainment and other services. US airports, for example, reported near-record traffic over the Memorial Day weekend. A healthy job market typically drives consumer spending, the economy’s principal fuel. Though some recent signs had raised concerns about economic weakness, May’s jobs report should help assuage those fears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, Friday's report from the government included some signs of a potential slowdown. The unemployment rate, for example, edged up for a second straight month, to a still-low 4 percent, from 3.9 percent, ending a 27-month streak of unemployment below 4 percent. That streak had matched the longest such run since the late 1960s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden pointed to Friday's jobs report as a sign of the economy’s robust health under his administration. He also charged that congressional Republicans would worsen inflation by cutting health care subsidies and widening the deficit through tax cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has focused his criticism of Biden’s economic policies on the surge in inflation , which polls show still weighs heavily in voters’ assessment of the economy. At a rally in Phoenix on Thursday, he blamed illegal immigration for contributing to higher prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists say the mixed signals from Friday's report – a surge in jobs alongside a slight rise in unemployment – are likely a sign that the job market is normalising after years of distortions related to the pandemic. After the brutal pandemic recession, when unemployment rocketed to nearly 15 percent, hiring soared in 2022 and 2023 as the economy quickly recovered. Wages, before adjusting for inflation, also jumped as businesses desperately sought to fill jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of open jobs, while still elevated, has fallen to a three-year low, the government said this week. Fewer workers are quitting their jobs, after quits had soared after the pandemic. Many employers say it's become easier to find workers to fill their open jobs. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports grew more quickly and for a second month in May, suggesting factory owners are managing to find buyers overseas and providing some relief to the economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 7.6 percent year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Friday, beating a forecast 6 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 1.5 percent rise seen in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports increased 1.8 percent in May, slowing from an 8.4 percent jump in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over recent months, a flurry of data has shown different parts of the US$18.6 trillion economy recovering at varying speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While first quarter growth blew past forecasts and strong March export and output data suggested improving global demand might aid officials' efforts to get the economy back on a more even keel, recent indicators have reflected domestic consumption had softened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A protracted property sector crisis remains the biggest drag on China's economy, with low investor and consumer confidence hurting domestic consumption and undermining business activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Friday's trade data should give authorities some breathing space as they continue their efforts to foster a broad-based economic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund last month upgraded its China growth forecast for 2024 in line with Beijing's growth target of "around" five percent, but warned of risks to the economy from the property troubles. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were little changed on Thursday after hitting records a day earlier, as traders awaited data on the labour market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones inched up 0.2 percent to 38,886, while the S&P 500 ended flat at 5,352.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 17,173.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached new highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not uncommon. It seems like every time the market makes a new high, there is not a lot of follow through," said Karl Haeling of LBBW.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market movements also came after the European Central Bank lowered interest rates for the first time since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haeling noted that although the ECB cut was anticipated, its tone was "less dovish than expected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All attention is now on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, as traders look for signs that the US central bank may soon follow suit in reducing interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, traders are looking ahead to the latest US employment report due out on Friday indicating the health of the labour market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While hiring has proven more resilient than anticipated in the face of high interest rates, cooling job growth could prompt the Fed to lower rates sooner rather than later.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US trade deficit expanded slightly less than analysts expected in April, to the widest since late 2022, as imports rose more quickly than exports, according to government data released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overall gap was US$74.6 billion, growing from March's revised US$68.6 billion figure, said the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the largest deficit since October 2022, according to official data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US consumption has been more resilient than anticipated even as the central bank rapidly hiked interest rates to dampen demand – and this has helped to support imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with weaker global demand, there have been concerns that export growth would not be able to keep up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors are also watching the Federal Reserve for the outcome of its policy meeting next week, looking for hints on when it might start cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The early data are pointing to a drag from trade in the second quarter," said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, imports grew by 2.4 percent to US$338.2 billion, while exports rose by 0.8 percent to US$263.7 billion, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jump in imports was largely due to an increase in goods such as automotive vehicles, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goods exports, meanwhile, also picked up but by a smaller degree, with a rise seen in products like pharmaceutical preparations and electric apparatus, data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Imports have been supported by strong domestic demand and lean inventories," said Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exports have contended with a weaker global backdrop and a strong US dollar which makes domestic goods relatively more expensive abroad," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goods deficit with China dropped by US$2.5 billion to US$22.1 billion in April. This was mainly due to a decrease in imports. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index pushed to new highs on Wednesday. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756277_1_20240606034443.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs on Wednesday, powered mainly by technology stocks as markets digested economic data that could support a much-expected start to the Federal Reserve's policy easing cycle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to end at 5,354, the Nasdaq Composite gained just under two percent to 17,187. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 percent to 38,807.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The May private payrolls report on Wednesday became the latest data to suggest an easing in labour market tightness that could propel the Fed to begin cutting rates this year. A report on Tuesday showed job openings fell in April to the fewest in more than three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're seeing the economic data starting to ease up a little bit and the repercussions for that is that you're seeing the pressure on rates come off the boil a little bit mixed in with the potential for weaker economic data, which is a pretty good recipe for the bond market," said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a nearly 69 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Expectations had hovered around 50 percent last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US 10-year Treasury yields fell to a two-month low on Wednesday after a report pointed to weaker-than-expected job growth ahead of Friday's highly anticipated government employment report for May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip stocks leapt, buoyed by gains to Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which both touched record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hewlett Packard Enterprise rose after forecasting third-quarter revenue above Street expectations, helped by upbeat demand for its AI servers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel gained after buyout firm Apollo Global Management agreed to purchase 49 percent for US$11 billion in a joint venture related to the chipmaker's Ireland manufacturing unit. (Reuters)

    Lawsuit says Google parent abused its position

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Google has urged Britain's competition watchdog to block a lawsuit that accuses the tech giant of abusing its position. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756264_1_20240605234046.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google parent Alphabet must face a lawsuit worth up to 13.6 billion pounds for allegedly abusing its dominance in the online advertising market, London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit, which seeks damages on behalf of publishers of websites and apps based in the United Kingdom, is the latest case to focus on the search giant's business practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action is bringing the claim on behalf of publishers who say they have suffered losses due to Google's allegedly anti-competitive behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google last month urged the CAT to block the case, which it argued was incoherent. The company "strongly rejects the underlying allegations", its lawyers said in court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CAT said in a written ruling that it would certify the case to proceed towards a trial, which is unlikely to take place before the end of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tribunal also emphasised the test for certifying a case under the UK's collective proceedings regime – which is roughly equivalent to the United States' class action regime – is relatively low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Google works constructively with publishers across the UK and Europe," Google legal director Oliver Bethell said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bethell added: "This lawsuit is speculative and opportunistic. We'll oppose it vigorously and on the facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Claudio Pollack, a partner of Ad Tech Collection Action, said: "This is a decision of major importance to the victims of Google's anti-competitive conduct in ad tech. Google will now have to answer for its practices in a full trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action's case comes amid ongoing probes by regulators into Google's adtech business, including by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the European Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google is also fighting two lawsuits in the United States, one brought by the Department of Justice and another by Texas and other states, accusing the company of anti-competitive conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google's lawyers said in documents for the CAT case that the company's "impact in the ad tech industry has been hugely pro-competitive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wednesday's decision is the latest against a tech giant to be given the green light by the CAT, which already this year has certified a US$3.8 billion case against Facebook parent Meta and a nearly US$1 billion case against Apple. (Reuters)

    'Wealth connect scheme could be widened further'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, says they are looking into further upgrading the cross-border Wealth Connect Scheme. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756167_1_20240605125906.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Eddie Yue on Wednesday said authorities are looking into the feasibility of further widening a wealth connect scheme to attract large sums of capital from the Greater Bay Area to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a wealth summit, Yue noted that the city’s de facto central bank upgraded the “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme” to a 2.0 version in February, to cover a greater variety of investment products and enabling more mainland investors to trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue said the authorities are now studying whether the scheme can be upgraded to a 3.0 version, so the city can better cater to private banking customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s still in the early days, [but] we are talking to the industry very closely about what's needed. Is it the quota? Or is it the scope of products? Or is it the selling process?” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, the quota. Currently, the individual quota is up to three million renminbi, but that's actually not quite enough for private bank clients. Is there a way to have a separate channel to capture the private bank clients?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The selling process has been a lot easier and smoother than before. But can it be further streamlined? Or can the marketing be made more active? Can the education be done better? I think there are still areas that we can look into in terms of improvements,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue added that a significant increase in capital inflows from the north to the SAR was observed following the previous upgrade, and indicated that a further expansion could potentially attract more middle-class investors in the development zone who have the greatest need to diversify their assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme, launched in September 2021, was Beijing’s first tailor-made plan to boost sales and capital flows between Hong Kong, Macau and the nine other cities in the Greater Bay Area.

    Wall Street up as jobs data boosts rates hope

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended a shade higher on Tuesday following softer-than-expected labor market data that reaffirmed expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Tuesday showed that US job openings fell to their lowest level in more than three years in April, signaling an easing in labour market tightness that supported a Fed rate cut this year. The US Treasury yields slipped following the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's main indexes gained ground after paring earlier loses. Equities in real estate and consumer staples sectors advanced ahead of others, while materials and energy stocks were the biggest losers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The labour market data was the latest in a string of recent reports that pointed to cooling US economic growth. Data on Monday showed that US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we've seen in the data so far this week is that it's been relatively weak, starting with manufacturing PMI and job openings today," said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in Santa Monica, California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That has had a total effect of helping the rally in the bond market; but for the stock market, it's a double-edged sword because they're looking for a rate cut announcement, which has a rising probability with weaker data," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.36 percent, to 38,711, the S&P 500 gained 0.15 percent, to 5,291 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.17 percent, to 16,857.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacap technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, ended higher after losing ground early in the session. Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron fell 1.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, as demand concerns weighed on crude prices.
  <br/>

  The Tencent-backed firm, also known as XtalPi, is offering 187.37 million shares, 95 percent of which will be issued internationally and five percent of which will be issued in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price range of the shares will be between HK$5.03 and HK$6.03, with an “entry fee” of HK$6,091. Trading will begin on June 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The listing is under the Chapter 18C rule introduced by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in March last year, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies with a valuation of at least HK$10 billion are allowed to sell shares in IPOs even if they are yet to generate revenue. For firms that have generated revenue, the valuation threshold is reduced to HK$6 billion if they had at least HK$250 million in sales in the financial year prior to their IPO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the firm’s chairman, Wen Shuhao, said the introduction of Chapter 18C shows the city’s capital markets value the technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company plans to bring in eight cornerstone investors with a combined contribution of nearly HK$338 million to subscribe for the shares, including Peter Lee, the chairman of Henderson Land Development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronald Tam, QuantumPharm's chief financial officer, said he believes the Shenzhen-headquartered firm will be able to generate profits in the near term, despite seeing losses over the past three financial years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chapter 18C rule applies to applicants in high-tech, advanced hardware and software, new materials, new energy, as well as food and agriculture technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only other firm which has applied to list under the rule so far is Black Sesame International Holding, which produces chips for autonomous driving.

<div class="itemFullText">
 S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged higher in a choppy session on Monday amid soft manufacturing sector data and as a glitch on the NYSE briefly caused trading halts in dozens of equities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange had triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold. Trading in at least 60 NYSE-listed stocks was halted due to the volatility, before the bourse fixed the technical issue and activity resumed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished higher after paring earlier losses on the sesson, while the Dow lost ground. Technology stocks were the biggest gainers, while energy equities were the biggest drag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets had weighed data showing US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month, raising concerns of weakening economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of those days where people are waiting for the next catalyst with a choppy move after earnings," said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's bit of a tug of war between the market seeing weakening data and the expectation that the Fed may cut rates," Lerner added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.30 percent, to 38,571, the S&P 500 gained 0.11 percent, to 5,283 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.56 percent, to 16,829.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia rose 4.9 percent after CEO Jensen Huang revealed that the company's next-generation AI chip platform would be rolled out in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of other megacaps, including Apple, Amazon , Alphabet, and Meta closed higher. Microsoft and Tesla finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop soared 21 percent after a weekend Reddit post from stocks influencer Keith Gill, also known as "Roaring Kitty", showed a US$116 million bet on the gaming retailer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will be eyeing a data-packed week that includes surveys on the services sector, factory orders and Friday's closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, which could provide clues to the Fed's likely course of action with regards to rates. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold, and trading halts in dozens of other companies on Monday, before the bourse fixed the problem.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange, by late morning said on its website it had resolved a reported technical issue and that the impacted stocks had resumed trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 60 stocks listed on the NYSE were halted due to volatility and some stocks showed unusual outsized movements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold shares were shown to be down 99.97 percent and 98.54 percent, respectively, due to the technical issue, before those trades were corrected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NYSE said the problem was related to Limit Up-Limit Down bands meant to prevent extraordinary market volatility and extreme price movements in individual stock by preventing trades outside of specific price ranges that are updated throughout the trading day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price band for each security is set at a percentage level above and below its average price in the preceding five-minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bands were developed as part of the response by financial regulators and exchanges to the "flash crash" of 2010, which wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in market capitalisation in a few minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Technical issues on exchanges can hit markets, impact traders' confidence and attract scrutiny from regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think the overall market is reacting," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong's economy would continue to grow despite the challenges brought by geopolitical tensions and changes in consumption patterns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting on financial affairs, Chan said growth in employment income and a recovery in the stock market should help increase private spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho asked what would be done to help the struggling retail sector after sales dropped in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister said the government was in talks with central authorities for measures to boost the local economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are indeed looking into increasing the duty-free allowances for visitors returning to the mainland right now. The HK$5,000 figure has been in place for quite some time. We have been liaising with the central authorities on this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have recently included eight other cities in the individual visit scheme, and we will seek to expand the scheme even further. While we do understand that we should have more such policy support in place, we should be prudent in the effects or potential impact of these measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election committee lawmaker Tan Yueheng was concerned over whether there would be measures to reverse the trend of Hongkongers heading north to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may be hard to compete in terms of prices, but we can enhance the quality of services in Hong Kong. So how can we promote two-way consumption to enhance the contribution of consumption to GDP in Hong Kong?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Chan said the city should look for ways to improve product and tourist experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have our unique attractions. We never compete with others in terms of price. We compete with others in terms of the quality of services. We compete with others in terms of the quality of our goods and services and the experience we offer," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think various sectors, be it retail or catering, we all need to transform and enhance our competitiveness and increase the cost to value of their products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief noted that property prices have stabilised after the scrapping of all "spicy" property cooling measures, adding the SAR would think of ways to avoid getting caught up in the cross-hairs of Sino-US tensions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Sunday said it is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic passenger flights by the first quarter of 2025, having reached 80 percent of capacity within the second quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's flagship airline, which suffered heavy losses and layoffs during the pandemic, had aimed to reach 100 percent capacity by the end of 2024, but in March moved the target back three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay reported its first annual profit in four years in March, however executives said they expect yields to normalise this year as the post-pandemic global imbalance between supply of flights and travel demand that drove up ticket prices and airline yields diminishes as airlines add capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed we're seeing that this year ... the yield has been normalising gradually coming down from last year. In particular, the supply and demand balancing is going quicker on the regional, the short haul routes,"  Cathay CEO Ronald Lam told reporters during an airline conference in Dubai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier also restored capacity more slowly after the pandemic than its closest rival, Singapore Airlines, because it faced tighter quarantine rules for longer, and needed to hire more staff to bring back services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said Cathay's plan to expand its workforce by around 20 percent, or 5,000 people, this year was also on track. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day mainly higher on Friday, with the Dow and S&P both rising after April data for the Fed's favoured inflation measure broadly matched expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The moves came after Commerce Department data showed that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in April, largely unchanged from March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 1.5 percent at 38,686, while the S&P 500 ended the day 0.8 percent higher at 5,277.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq was the only major New York index that did not rise on Friday, closing almost unchanged at 16,735.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're on track for a positive month," Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones said before the closing bell, adding that there was often "a bit of rebalancing" at the end of the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe on Monday that could easily be reversed," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual firms, tech firm Dell Technologies tumbled 17.9 percent despite beating earnings expectations, with some analysts pointing to a lower-than-expected backlog for artificial intelligence servers.

    <![CDATA[<img alt='New York Fed president John Williams says he expects inflation will "resume moderating in the second half of this year."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation remained unchanged in April, according to government data published on Friday, as services prices remained elevated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news will likely lead the US central bank to keep interest rates elevated throughout the summer, as it balances a desire to start easing monetary policy with the need to keep inflation falling towards its long-term two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said in a statement, while monthly inflation increased by 0.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These figures were in line with the median forecast in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, and came in at the same level as it did in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After falling for much of last year, inflation accelerated again at the start of 2024, reducing the likelihood of early rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High rates also complicate US President Joe Biden's reelection message as he seeks to convince still-sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, services sector inflation drove much of the increase, rising at an annual rate of 3.9 percent – slightly lower than a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stripping out volatile food and energy prices – both of which continued to rise last month – the closely watched "core" measure of inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in April, in line with expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This suggests that underlying inflation remains elevated, a fact which could keep the Fed on pause for longer than previously anticipated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, New York Fed president John Williams, who is a permanent voting member of the US central bank's rate-setting committee, said he expected inflation would "resume moderating in the second half of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at all the data, I don't feel any urgency or need to make a decision now," he told an event in New York, adding that things were going in the "right direction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data published on Friday also show that personal income eased to 0.3 percent last month, the Commerce Department said, down slightly from 0.5 percent in March.

    Hong Kong retail sales fall in April

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The value of total retail sales for April dropped nearly 15 percent compared with the same month in 2023.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Provisional data from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the city's retail sales for April fell 14.7 percent from a year earlier, partly due to a drop in visitor spending and a large number of outbound trips during the Easter holidays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales decreased to HK$29.6 billion in the second consecutive month of decline after a seven percent drop in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first four months of 2024 taken together, it was provisionally estimated the value of total retail sales decreased by 4.7 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in April 2024 saw it decrease by 16.5 percent compared with a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined notably in April from a year earlier, partly because the Easter holidays rendered the effects of the changing consumption pattern of residents more visible," a government spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large number of residents made outbound trips during the Easter holidays. This not only affected their local consumption during their time away but also could have reduced consumption in the days before and after the trips."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that unstable weather in April also had an impact on spending. Looking ahead, he said the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents would continue to pose a challenge to the local retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the government hoped the revival of inbound tourism and rising earnings, as well as the new round of mega events plus the recent stabilisation of asset markets such as property would provide support to the market and boost the economy.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell for a second straight session on Thursday following a downgrade in a US growth report as several large tech shares tumbled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the January to March period, the Commerce Department said, below the 1.6 percent figure published last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Dow member Salesforce plunged nearly 20 percent as the technology company published mixed results and lowered some of its full-year projections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other large tech companies followed Salesforce lower. Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon all fell 1.5 percent or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 38,111.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent to 5,235, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.1 percent to 16,737.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses came on the heels of Wednesday's session in which major indices retreated amid worries that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high due to persistent inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about interest rates. We don't see any relief in sight from the Fed," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "There is a growing view that they won't cut at all this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Best Buy soared 13.4 percent despite reporting a 6.1 percent drop in comparable sales as investors were encouraged by commentary suggesting an improvement in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Kohl's plunged 22.9 percent after results missed expectations. The retailer reported a loss of US$27 million. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three main indexes were lower in New York at midday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755452_1_20240531004342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets diverged on Thursday, a day ahead of key inflation indicators that could determine the future direction of interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All the main indexes were lower in New York at midday, following on to Wednesday's slump when shares were hit by concerns that interest rates will not be coming down any time soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US shares were also hit by Salesforce slumping 21 percent after the software company reported disappointing results the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Treasury yields fell back after figures pointed to a slightly weakening US economy, though they were just off their recent highs, indicating expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's second update to first quarter GDP data showed it grew an annually adjusted 1.3 percent, slower than the initial estimate of 1.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders awaited Friday's release of the crucial personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, hoping for signs that prices are being brought under control enough for rates to be cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though Treasury yields eased this morning from yesterday's four-week highs, the market appears anxious heading into PCE," said Joe Mazzola, a strategist at Charles Schwab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rising yields snuffed out the tech-led stock market rally yesterday even before Salesforce missed quarterly revenue expectations and sank double-digits," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday also sees the release of the latest eurozone consumer price index, a key release ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting on June 6 and which could decide whether the central bank goes ahead and as expected cuts rates by 25 basis points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe's main stock markets closed higher on Thursday, making up some of the losses from the previous session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Thursday, the Sydney stock market closed lower with shares in BHP shedding 1.7 percent after the Australian mining giant ended its US$49-billion takeover bid for British rival Anglo American, whose shares were down five percent in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices fell ahead of this weekend's Opec meeting over concerns about future demand in China and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Oil is on track for its second straight day of falling prices amid softer US growth data ahead of Sunday's Opec+ meeting," said Axel Rudolph, Senior Market Analyst at IG. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Wednesday as rising Treasury bond yields prompted a wave of selling after recent records.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Now that the (first-quarter earnings) period is essentially over, inflation and interest rates are front of mind," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, noting that the Dow has pulled back after topping 40,000 earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 percent on the day to 38,441.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.7 percent to 5,266, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.6 percent to 16,920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have attributed the rise in Treasury yields partly to commentary from US Federal Reserve officials warning that elevated inflation could keep interest rates high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market observers have also cited disappointing demand for US Treasury bonds as a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Fed's latest "beige book" of economic conditions pointed to a somewhat gloomier outlook, although economic activity remained positive from early April to mid-May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Marathon Oil shot up 8.4 percent after it agreed to be acquired by ConocoPhillips in an all-stock transaction valued at US$22.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ConocoPhillips declined 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Airlines sank 13.5 percent after it lowered its profit outlook, citing weaker demand and a troubled booking system upgrade. (AFP)

    BHP abandons bid for Anglo American

    <![CDATA[<img alt="BHP has scrapped a huge takeover offer just before a key deadline. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755279_1_20240530014949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's BHP announced on Wednesday that it has walked away from a proposed US$49-billion takeover of British rival Anglo American that would have created a copper titan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BHP said in a statement that it will not make a firm offer for Anglo American, ending a six-week saga and scrapping its gigantic proposal just before a key Wednesday deadline which its UK rival had refused to extend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A core part of BHP's plan was splitting off Anglo's platinum holdings in South Africa, a politically sensitive move that stirred government opposition ahead of the country's general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP's offer had also proposed Anglo American hiving off its iron ore production activities in South Africa under plans to focus on copper, demand for which is booming over its use in green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP will not be making a firm offer for Anglo American," BHP chief executive Mike Henry said in a statement bringing an end to their efforts, which had seen the Australian company twice raise its initial proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we believed that our proposal for Anglo American was a compelling opportunity to effectively grow the pie of value for both sets of shareholders, we were unable to reach agreement with Anglo American on our specific views in respect of South African regulatory risk and cost."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP remained confident however that its plan "was the most effective structure to deliver value for Anglo American shareholders" and could have "obtained all required regulatory approvals, including in South Africa", he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-listed giant had rejected a third offer from BHP last week, worth 38.6 billion pounds, but agreed to keep talks alive for seven more days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to BHP's overtures, Anglo had recently announced it would offload its coal, diamond and platinum businesses to focus on critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Wednesday, Anglo American had rejected BHP's request to extend talks over its vast proposal beyond a 1600 GMT deadline for it to either make a concrete offer or abandon the bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said its board had unanimously concluded that there was "no basis for a further extension" for BHP to explore its proposal, adding that there were "fundamental concerns" over the bid structure and value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The offer "includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure", Anglo American argued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the deadline, BHP -- which is listed in London and Sydney -- had made a last-ditch attempt to mollify concerns and keep its bid alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP believes that its proposal will contribute to South Africa and allow the benefits of South African mining to be shared with more South African stakeholders," the company had insisted in its previous statement as it requested a further deadline extension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any deal between two of the world's largest resources companies would have fundamentally reshaped the sector, with far-reaching consequences for commodities markets and the global energy transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP's interest was largely stoked by its hunger to secure a reliable copper supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anglo American's South American copper holdings include four of the largest copper mines in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An electrical conductor used in wiring, the metal is seen as a bedrock of emerging clean-energy industries -- a crucial component to manufacture solar panels, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also widely regarded as vital for the development of cutting-edge AI technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copper prices have increased about 400 percent in the past quarter of a century, and broke US$10,000 a tonne in April for the first time in two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boom has already prompted a wave of investment, with BHP snapping up Australian copper producer OZ Minerals for more than US$6 billion last year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Wednesday announced the creation of an "AI Office" of tech experts, lawyers and economists to regulate artificial intelligence under a sweeping new law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU this year approved the world's first comprehensive rules to govern AI, especially powerful systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT after long, intense negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First proposed in 2021, the bloc raced to get the law in the books after ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, leaving users stunned by its ability to churn out coherent text including poems within seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The AI Office aims at enabling the future development, deployment and use of AI in a way that fosters societal and economic benefits and innovation, while mitigating risks," the European Commission said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 140-member AI Office will be established within the commission, which is the EU's executive arm and also acts as the bloc's powerful tech regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Office will foster a European AI ecosystem that is innovative, competitive and respectful of EU rules and values," the EU's top tech enforcer, Thierry Breton, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's law known as the "AI Act" has tougher rules for general-purpose AI systems such as ChatGPT and takes a risk-based approach to the technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The higher the risk to Europeans' rights or health, for example, the greater the systems' obligations to protect individuals from harms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with developers and a scientific community, the office will evaluate and test general purpose AI to ensure that AI serves us as humans and upholds our European values," commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies will have to comply with the EU's law by 2026, but rules covering AI models like ChatGPT will apply 12 months after the law becomes official.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's announcement came on the same day that EU auditors criticised the commission for failing to sufficiently invest in AI to achieve the bloc's ambitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, stronger governance and more -- and better targeted -- public and private investment in the EU will be paramount if the EU is to achieve its AI ambitions," the bloc's spending watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the commission defended the bloc's record and said it was investing more than one billion euros (US$1.1 billion) annually in AI research projects under different schemes. (AFP)

    ConocoPhillips to snap up Marathan Oil

<div class="itemFullText">
 US energy giant ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday it will acquire competitor Marathon Oil in an all-stock transaction valued at US$22.5 billion, including US$5.4 billion in debt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deal, the latest in a series of major acquisitions in the US oil sector, will enable ConocoPhillips to strengthen its position in shale oil and gas-rich regions such as the Bakken Basin in the northern United States and the Permian Basin in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acquisition "further deepens our portfolio and fits within our financial framework, adding high-quality, low cost of supply inventory adjacent to our leading US unconventional position," ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer Ryan Lance said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the company sees "significant synergy potential" in the merger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marathon Oil chief Lee Tillman said it was a "proud moment to look back on what we achieved," and that ConocoPhillips was "the right home to build on that legacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, gives Marathon Oil shareholders 0.255 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each share of Marathon Oil common stock. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s lived-in home prices rose for the second straight month in April, increasing by 0.3 percent from March, with all home sizes seeing gains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Wednesday showed that the latest official price index of second-hand units stood at 308.7 last month, compared with 305.7 in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase was broad-based, as all small, medium, and large sized units saw gains of about 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came after the index logged its first increase in 11 months in March, as buyers returned to the market after Financial Secretary Paul Chan scrapped all property cooling measures in his Budget on February 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, taking the first four months in total, home prices still fell 0.84 percent, and the latest index level was still about 13 percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rental prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent on a monthly basis, also a second straight increase, but still 4.6 percent lower from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s rents rose 0.5 percent in the first four months of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday raised its 2024 growth forecast for China to five percent, citing recent policy moves by Beijing to boost the nation's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's economic growth is projected to remain resilient at five percent in 2024 and slow to 4.5 percent in 2025," the IMF said in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was "driven by strong first-quarter GDP data and recent policy measures", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fund had initially projected 4.6 percent growth for this year – compared with "around five percent" targeted by authorities in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF also welcomed official steps in recent weeks to boost the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, it added that "a more comprehensive policy package would facilitate an efficient and less costly transition while safeguarding against downside risks". (AFP)
