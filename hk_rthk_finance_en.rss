<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, as traders looked ahead to earnings results from US chipmaking giant Nvidia after the closing bell.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished the day down 0.4 percent at 41,091, and the S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent to 5,592.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq closed down more than 1.1 percent at 17,556.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past couple of weeks, Nvidia has been rising, with the anticipation being that the company is going to do better than expectations," said Ventura Wealth Management's Tom Cahill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the bar is so high that it's not hard to imagine them saying growth is going to slow even just a little bit," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That would be very negative for the stock and therefore technology stocks in the market. There's a little apprehension."
  <br/>

  Nvidia's share price closed down 2.1 percent ahead of its earnings results.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks mostly ticked lower on Wednesday, as investors await chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report after the closing bell.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 15 minutes into trading, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 5,616, while the tech-rich Nasdaq slumped 0.5 percent to 17,674.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones was flat at 41,232.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The focus on chip titan Nvidia comes as markets try to gauge the health of the tech and AI sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has seen profits surge thanks to demand for its GPU chips, which have set the industry's pace in pushing new AI advances – making it an indicator for the sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia shares slid 1.4 percent in early trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from Nvidia, traders will also be monitoring an update to US second quarter GDP growth on Thursday and data on the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation gauge on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While a US central bank rate cut is widely expected in September, upcoming economic indicators are watched for their potential bearing on how big the reductions could go.

    EV giant BYD reports sharp rise in net profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's leading automaker BYD reported a 24.4 percent rise in net profit for the first half of 2024.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD reported a 32.8 percent rise in second-quarter net profit on Wednesday, its fastest growth since the end of 2023, despite faltering spending on big-ticket items in the world's largest car market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Net profit hit 9.1 billion yuan (US$1.3 billion) in the April-June quarter, while revenue was up 25.9 percent from a year earlier at 176.2 billion yuan, it said in a stock exchange filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first half of 2024, net profit jumped 24.4 percent to 13.6 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has taken a significant lead in the electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle sector, leveraging its vertical integration strategy by using key components such as batteries made by the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has outsold the combined sales of Volkswagen's two joint ventures in China by 14.5 percent in the first seven months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to unseat Tesla as the largest EV vendor this year with a 17.7 percent share of the global market, versus Tesla's 17.2 percent, according to analysts' estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been offering aggressive discounts for its best-selling Dynasty and Ocean series of EVs to secure its leadership position with a more than one-third share in China's new energy vehicle market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD has also expanded its international presence, such as in Europe and Mexico, where it has plans to set up manufacturing facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company is facing a 17 percent additional tariff for exporting EVs from China to countries in the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overseas shipments accounted for 11.9 percent of BYD's total car sales in the first seven months of the year, nearly double the number for the same period last year, according to calculations based on BYD's monthly data. (Reuters)

    HKMA launches digital currency sandbox

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said he is pleased to see financial institutions expressing great interest in experimenting with wCBDC. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768015_1_20240828172547.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has launched an initiative that allows financial institutions to experiment with the use of its wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) in a controlled space.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The digital currency was introduced in March with the purpose of letting financial institutions settle interbank payments and trades faster and easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Project Ensemble Sandbox provides a virtual environment in which financial institutions can look at how to use digital currencies in various scenarios, with no risk of affecting the real-world market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said he is pleased to see financial institutions expressing great interest in experimenting with wCBDC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the launch of the sandbox is the city’s first step towards harnessing blockchain technology and smart contracts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see the sandbox as a pioneering financial infrastructure and also a collaborative platform to test and refine different use cases, covering areas ranging from fixed income and investment funds, liquidity management, green and sustainable finance to trade and supply chain financing,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But the potential of the sandbox extends far beyond these initial applications. It is designed in a way that will enable it to support various forms of digital money and digital assets and ensure seamless integration with other infrastructure in the future.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue said he hopes the pilot use cases would help set industry benchmarks for tokenisation in Hong Kong, as well as offer solutions to pain points in the real economy, including supply chain finance and cross-border payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Julia Leung, said the financial regulator fully supports HKMA's project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the SFC has been ahead of the game in providing guidance to the industry on the use of tokenised securities, as well as allowing the launch of investment funds in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are among the first to set clear regulatory expectations in these areas… These pilots have demonstrated cost savings and efficiency gains in the different phases of the product lifecycle, but they also point to the hurdles in reaping the full benefits of on-chain primary issuance, secondary market trading, custody, and hypothecation during the full product lifecycle. This is where today's sandbox comes in,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung added that the SFC is aware of hurdles the industry participants may face as they pilot test different use scenarios in the sandbox and assured them that the SFC will work closely with the HKMA to provide guidance and address concerns that arise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representatives from six sandbox participants – Bank of China, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, Standard Chartered Hong Kong, HashKey Group and Ant Digital Technologies – also attended the ceremony and spoke about their individual plans for the sandbox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA said it will hold regular meetings with the financial institutions and the SFC to review the sandbox candidates' readiness to operate in the live market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKMA deputy chief executive Howard Lee said there is no specific timetable or expected duration for the sandbox programme, saying some cases may reach maturity in two to three months, while others may take longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say it would depend on individual cases and what kind of activities they are going to touch upon. If they are talking about tokenised bond this is a pretty mature financial product … that would be more ready to be transferred to the real life environment using different settlement methods or even tokenised deposit to do it… But for those who are a little bit less familiar and they might require more discussion with HKMA, with SFC, then these projects might need a little bit more time,” he said.

    Home prices fall again, rents hit near 5-year highs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures showed home prices in Hong Kong continued to fall last month, whereas rents reached their highest in nearly five years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to data from the Rating and Valuation Department, private flats were 1.9 percent cheaper in July than the month before, marking the third consecutive month of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home prices briefly rose after the government scrapped all market-cooling measures in February, before the downward trend resumed in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, prices were down by 4.7 percent year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have said sales may pick up after interest rates start to fall, with the US Federal Reserve indicating that it will begin reducing borrowing costs in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, strong demand pushed rents up by 1.1 percent last month from June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That raised private sector rents to their highest levels since October 2019.

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell in early trading on Wednesday, opening down 0.15 percent at 17,848.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks ended on Tuesday slightly higher as markets look ahead to an earnings report by chipmaker Nvidia this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,625, as did the Nasdaq, which closed at 17,754.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones was flat at 41,250.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks are treading water as investors await AI chipmaker Nvidia's results after markets close on Wednesday – eyeing the company as a gauge of the tech and AI sectors' health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is "pent-up demand" to see what Nvidia will do next, said Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the economy is "not doing great," it is good enough for key indices to continue advancing, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, markets have been assuaged by comments of US central bank chief Jerome Powell, who said last week that the time had come for interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders widely anticipate a cut of at least 25 basis points after Federal Reserve policymakers gather for a meeting in September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would mark the Fed's first rate reductions after raising rates during the pandemic.

    US consumer confidence up slightly in August

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The modest rise in consumer confidence is likely to be well-received by Vice President Kamala Harris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767898_1_20240828001001.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumer confidence in the United States rose slightly in August, according to survey data published on Tuesday, beating expectations and extending a recent increase in optimism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Conference Board's consumer confidence index inched higher to 103.3 in August, up slightly from a revised figure of 101.9 a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was comfortably above market expectations, according to Briefing.com.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The modest rise is likely to be well-received by US Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against former president Donald Trump in November's elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two candidates have looked to talk up their respective economic records, with the cost of living and inflation playing a major role in the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall consumer confidence rose in August but remained within the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years," Conference Board chief economist Dana Peterson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Consumers continued to express mixed feelings in August," she added. "Compared to July, they were more positive about business conditions, both current and future, but also more concerned about the labour market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month's US jobs report came in well below expectations, setting off a brief fall in stock markets and raising fears of recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, markets stabilised almost as rapidly as they had fallen, and monetary policymakers have stressed that the labour market remains relatively strong by historical standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Consumers' assessments of the current labour situation, while still positive, continued to weaken, and assessments of the labour market going forward were more pessimistic," Peterson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumer confidence declined for people under the age of 35, although young people remained the most optimistic age group, according to Peterson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there was a disparity based on income, with consumers earning more than US$100,000 a year feeling the most confident, and those on salaries of less than US$25,000 noting a decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The index continues to waffle in a narrow range, much like other measures of consumer spirits," Navy Federal Credit Union corporate economist Robert Frick said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may take a major shift, such as significantly lower interest rates or the expansion getting a second wind, before we see optimism rise to pre-2020 levels," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation expectations dropped to 4.9 percent in August, their lowest level since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, the Conference Board said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumer expectations of higher interest rates in the next 12 months fell for the third consecutive month, hitting the lowest level since February this year. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s export figures have improved for the fifth consecutive month, rising 13.1 percent to HK$390.4 billion in July, when compared to the same month last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Tuesday showed imports rose 9.9 percent year-on-year to HK$412.3 billion, which left the city with a trade deficit of HK$21.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to the mainland, the United States and the European Union continued to rise, while sales to other major Asian markets had a mixed performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combining the figures for the first seven months of the year, exports jumped 12.4 percent year-on-year, while imports rose 8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said Hong Kong's exports should remain positive as long as external demand holds up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the spokesperson added that there are still risks associated with geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts.

    China raises strong objections to Canada tariffs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Canada has become the latest country to slap 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767796_1_20240827112608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's embassy in Canada on Tuesday raised its "strong dissatisfaction" over Ottawa's plans to impose 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle (EV) imports.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This move is typical trade protectionism and politically motivated decision," a spokesperson said in a statement on the embassy's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will damage trade and economic cooperation between China and Canada, hurt the interests of Canadian consumers and enterprises (and) slow down the green transition process of Canada," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said Canada's move "will disrupt the stability of global industrial and supply chains" and seriously undermine the global economic system and economic and trade rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Canadian side claims to support free trade and the multilateral trading system based on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but it flagrantly violates WTO rules, blindly follows individual countries, and announces that it will adopt unilateral tariff measures, which is typical trade protectionism," the spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has maintained that its electric vehicle industry does not rely on subsidies to gain a competitive edge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said its production keeps prices low for global consumers and will aid a transition to the green economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also unveiled a 25 percent surtax on imports of Chinese steel and aluminium products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a news conference in Halifax, Trudeau said Chinese EV overproduction and hefty state subsidies for its auto sector "requires us to take action."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unless we want to get in a race to the bottom, we have to stand up, and that's what we're doing," he said, adding the tariffs were a response to "this extraordinary threat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and the European Union have in recent months imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs of 100 percent and 38 percent, respectively. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day mixed on Monday, as another Federal Reserve policymaker came out in favour of starting interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is "hard to imagine" not cutting interest rates in September, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Monday, a few days after Fed chair Jerome Powell said the time had come to start adjusting monetary policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The direction of change is down, and the time to adjust is now," Daly said, signalling her support for a rate cut at the Fed's rate meeting next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones closed up 0.2 percent at 41,240.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent to 5,616, while the Nasdaq lost 0.9 percent, closing at 17,725.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think people used today as an opportunity to take some near-term profits," said Sam Stovall, from CFRA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tech stocks slipped, with Nvidia finishing the day down 2.3 percent ahead of quarterly earnings results on Wednesday. Broadcom slipped more than four percent. (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index climbed 97.17 points, or 0.55 percent to open at 17,709.27 points on Monday.

  This week traders in the US and around the globe are awaiting earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia, whose blistering run has powered markets throughout 2024.

  The S&P 500 has pared a sharp drop it suffered after US economic worries contributed to a sell-off at the beginning of the month and it again stands near a fresh all-time high.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Friday as dovish remarks from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell solidified expectations that the central bank will cut its key policy rate in September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In highly anticipated comments before the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, Powell said "the time has come" to lower the Fed funds target rate, and "the upside risks of inflation have diminished".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The long wait is over," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska. "This was the dovish shift that market participants have been waiting for."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is clearly turning to the dovish camp and Powell has made it crystal clear that September will be the start of multiple rate cuts coming the remainder of this year," Detrick added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US stock indexes jumped after the release of Powell's prepared remarks, with megacaps Nvidia, Apple and Tesla providing the most muscle. Small caps and regional banks were outperformers, rising 3.2 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Financials are at an all-time high, with a huge surge from regional banks," Detrick said. "One would think if a major calamity or a recession were on the horizon, regional banks and financials wouldn't be as strong as they’ve been."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indexes logged weekly advances, standing on the shoulders of last week's largest Friday-to-Friday percentage gains of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next week, the data-dependent Fed will have a raft of economic indicators to consider ahead of its September rate decision, including the Commerce Department's revised second-quarter GDP and its broad-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which includes the Fed's preferred inflation yardstick.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday offered an explicit endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job market would be unwelcome and expressing confidence that inflation was within reach of the US central bank's 2 percent target.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased," Powell said in a highly anticipated speech to the Kansas City Fed's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Referencing the two goals that the Fed is tasked by Congress to achieve, Powell said his "confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent," after rising to about 7 percent during the Covid-19 pandemic, while unemployment is increasing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Powell said the jump of nearly a percentage point in the unemployment rate over the past year was due largely to rising labour supply and slowed hiring, not increased layoffs, he also was emphatic that the Fed wanted to prevent any further erosion – his prior talk of labour market "pain" as necessary to control inflation now a thing of the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current unemployment rate of 4.3 percent is roughly at the level Fed officials feel is consistent with stable inflation over the longer run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labour market conditions," Powell said. "We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability. With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labour market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders on Friday continued to bet on a quarter-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed's September 17-18 meeting, but after Powell's remarks priced in about a one-in-three chance of a bigger half-percentage-point cut, up from a little more than a one-in-four probability earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Powell was clear about the first rate cut, but not so much about the next ones, so I don't think he'll be exploding out of the blocks with a 50-basis-point cut," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "I think slow and steady is how the Fed wants to pace this early part of the easing." (Reuters)

    HKMA to look into SMEs' struggles with bank repayments
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HKMA to look into SMEs' struggles with bank repayments" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767353_1_20240823144529.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Arthur Yuen, will lead a new task force to look into small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are having trouble with banks over their loan repayments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This task force was formed in response to calls from small businesses urging lenders to stop requesting early repayments or recalling loans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting with representatives from the Hong Kong Association of Banks on Friday morning, HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said the new body would aim at helping individual SMEs resolve their funding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Each case has its own background and uniqueness, and each case could be handled differently. I would encourage business chambers or companies to refer cases to the Authority immediately, if they hear or see any firms having difficulties, so that they can be dealt with by the task force and resolved with banks quickly,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another press briefing, the co-chairperson of the task force, Arthur Yuen, said the HKMA has received only a small number of complaints from SMEs which required its intervention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen added the banking sector has been supporting SMEs, noting that lenders have allowed around 4,000 small businesses to delay their loan repayments since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said a potential interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next month could help struggling small firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest burden that they (SMEs) are facing right now is perhaps much higher than three years ago,” he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's really an expectational issue, the forward-looking, where interest rates are heading that would help banks in assessing the repayment ability of a corporate model, including SMEs, because then they will have the interest rate outlook. They fit the interest rate outlook into their credit models, and that would definitely be helpful.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In face of concerns over the tightening policy of property loans, Yuen said the HKMA has urged lenders to complete their vetting requests for such loans within two weeks, unless applicants fail to provide the adequate information needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) welcomed the establishment of the task force, saying the new group would help SMEs in acquiring capital and promoting Hong Kong's economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, BPA lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said small businesses still need more support to overcome these difficult times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government may consider restarting the 100 percent guaranteed loan and also the payment holiday scheme. That is just pay the interest without repaying the principal, like for a period of 12 months," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all hope that (in) 2025, things will improve. And I hope as the economic situation improves, cash flow for the companies will also improve."

    Plan to upgrade Alibaba's HK listing approved

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Shareholders of e-commerce giant Alibaba approved a plan to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767339_1_20240823123627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Alibaba on Friday said it would upgrade its Hong Kong-listed shares to primary status, opening it up to China's huge army of investors that could potentially rake in billions of dollars for the firm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision by shareholders during its annual general meeting on Thursday will provide a much-needed boost to the firm, which has underperformed the market in recent years due to to weak consumption and after a crackdown by Beijing on the tech industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to announce that the voluntary conversion of our secondary listing to primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will become effective on August 28, 2024," the company announced on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, which is also listed in New York, had flagged the idea two years ago amid worries about a regulatory drive by US authorities as tensions simmered between Beijing and Washington, though that was later put off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba has been primarily traded in New York since 2014 and remained dual-listed after its notable return to Hong Kong through a second listing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the firm's shares in Hong Kong are down about 75 percent from their peak in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A conversion to primary status in Hong Kong could pave way for Alibaba to enter a cross-border scheme that allows investors in Shenzhen and Shanghai to trade Hong Kong-listed shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would open it up to China's more than 200 million investors and could see capital inflows of up to US$19.5 billion in the first six months of inclusion, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba this month reported a 29 percent fall in quarterly profit as it battles sluggish activity among China's consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uncertainty about Alibaba's future development has persisted since Beijing scuttled a planned initial public offering of the company's financial services arm, Ant Group, in late 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancelled listing -- which would likely have been the biggest in history -- was followed a month later by an announcement that Alibaba was under formal investigation in China for alleged monopolistic practices. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All three major US stock indexes lost ground on Thursday, weighed by technology shares, as Treasury yields rose on easing recession fears and global central bank officials convened at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The so-called Magnificent Seven megacap growth stocks weighed heaviest on the tech-laden Nasdaq.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There doesn't appear to be any kind of clear catalyst as to what's driving this sell-off," Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People may be trying to square positions a little bit ahead of Nvidia (earnings) next week, or risk-out ahead of (US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell's Jackson Hole speech tomorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Central bank officials from around the world have gathered in Jackson Hole for the annual Economic Symposium. Investors will be laser focused on Powell's address on Friday for clues on the timing and extent of the Fed's policy easing cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell is expected to assure the markets that the Fed will cut rates in September, Ladner said. "He'll be coy with the question about whether it's going to be a 25 or 50 basis point cut, but will probably try to lead the market towards 25."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will say he expects to start slow but will also emphasize that if they do see any further weakness in the labor market they can speed things up," Ladner added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News of increasing US jobless claims, following Wednesday's sharply lower benchmark payrolls revision, appear to confirm the labour market is less robust than expected and is gradually softening. This soothed recession fears while bolstering the case for a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September policy meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sentiment was echoed in remarks on Thursday from Kansas City Fed President Frank Schmid, Boston Fed President Susan Collins, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, all of whom indicated that a rate-cutting phase is shortly forthcoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What Fed officials are saying is a rate cut is definitely on the table, but there's still time between now and September and data can move things," Martin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.43 percent, to 40,713. The S&P 500 lost 0.89 percent, at 5,571 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.67 percent to 17,619. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Wednesday following solid earnings from big-box retailer Target and Federal Reserve meeting minutes that hinted at an upcoming interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Target – Walmart's smaller, North American-focused rival – soared more than 11 percent after reporting higher comparable store sales in its second quarter after a string of declines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, futures markets continued to bet on a September interest rate cut following Fed meeting minutes in which a "vast majority" of policy makers expressed support for an interest rate cut if economic data plays out as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones ended up 0.1 percent at 40,890.

  The S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 5,620, while Nasdaq rose 0.6 percent to 17,918.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed minutes were "dovish and though they're dated, they suggest the debate is not whether the central bank cuts interest rate at its upcoming September meeting but rather how aggressive the initial phase of this normalization cycle should be," said a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interest rate cuts are expected in light of a weaker US jobs market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Department figures released on Wednesday showed US employers added around 68,000 fewer jobs monthly in the 12-month period through March 2024 compared with earlier estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Ford climbed 1.5 percent despite announcing US$1.9 billion in costs connected to shifts in its electric vehicle strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automaker scuttled plans for one new EV model and pushed back the timeframe on a second vehicle in light of a slower-than-expected transition to EVs in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com, the Chinese online retail company, fell 4.2 percent after disclosing that Walmart divested its shares in the company.
  <br/>

  Among retailers reporting Wednesday, TJ Maxx parent TJX jumped 6.1 percent while Macy's slumped 13 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday announced that its first-half net profit for 2024 dropped three percent year-on-year to HK$6.13 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's bourse operator said it would pay an interim dividend of HK$4.36 per share, three percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, HKEX said net income for the second quarter, covering April to June, rose nine percent to HK$3.16 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were supported by the growth in trading and clearing fees from higher volumes across the cash, derivatives and commodities markets, according to HKEX's earnings statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKEX's Chief Executive Bonnie Chan said sentiment appears to be on the mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, while macro-environment uncertainties persist, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year," she added. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Walmart 'seeks to offload JD.com stake'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Walmart is the largest shareholder in JD.com, one of China's largest e-commerce companies. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767033_1_20240821134140.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Walmart is seeking to raise up to US$3.74 billion by selling its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters, as the US retailer focuses on its own operations in China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Walmart is offering 144.5 million American depositary shares in the price range of US$24.85 to US$25.85, the term sheet shows, and Morgan Stanley is the broker-dealer of the offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walmart, the largest shareholder in JD.com, said in a statement that it had been a valued partner over the past eight years, and the US retailer was committed to a continued commercial relationship with the Chinese e-commerce giant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This decision allows us to focus on our strong China operations for Walmart China and Sam's Club, and deploy capital towards other priorities," Walmart said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com's Hong Kong-listed shares fell more than 10 percent in early trading on Wednesday. US-listed shares dropped 10 percent in after-market trading on Tuesday to US$25.50 after Bloomberg first reported the share sale plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD.com declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese e-commerce giant last week reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, though its share price has fallen around 70 percent since its peak in early 2021, and trade is little changed from 2016 levels, when Walmart became its major shareholder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail market has been hit by a persistent downturn in consumer confidence, sparked by a property market slowdown and concerns about employment and incomes. Major e-commerce firms, including JD.com and rivals Alibaba and PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo have engaged in a price war in order to entice consumers to buy, pressuring revenue growth and margins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Walmart said the reduction was to focus on the Chinese market, especially Sam's Club," Liu Xingliang, an internet industry analyst at Beijing-based DCCI Data Center said of the share sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This means that Walmart is optimising its global business layout, rather than lacking confidence in JD.com's development prospects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walmart reported a 17.7 percent year-on-year rise in revenue from its China business to US$4.6 billion in the second quarter on the back of strong growth in its Sam's Club warehouse chain and its digital offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US retailer owns a 5.19 percent stake in JD.com, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The partnership between the companies began in 2016 when Walmart sold its Chinese online grocery store, Yihaodian in return for a 5 percent stake in JD.com. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday after an earlier rally supported by strong retail sales figures and a cooler inflation report – as investors look towards a speech from the Federal Reserve chief later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones lost 0.2 percent to 40,834, while the S&P 500 Index retreated by the same amount to 5,597.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.3 percent to 17,816.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a volatile couple of weeks, and we had a big, big rally from the lows," said Sam Burns, chief strategist at Mill Street Research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Usually, after that kind of a move – and it's been eight or nine days now of the S&P 500 being up – it's pretty typical to have a quiet day of consolidation like we're seeing today," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stock markets climbed after the consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, logged its smallest 12-month increase since 2021 – boosting the prospect of a September interest rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But now, investors are looking ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at the annual gathering of central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is widely anticipated to keep alive the prospect of a September start to rate cuts – and could give clues on the path of further reductions ahead.
  <br/>

  Among individual companies, shares in cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks jumped 7.2 percent on the back of quarterly results that topped estimates. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures released on Tuesday showed that overall consumer prices in Hong Kong rose by 2.5 percent last month compared with the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That inflation figure was larger than the corresponding increase of 1.5 percent in June and was the highest since November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed higher inflation data to the end of concessionary measures for ratepayers in June, and a rise in transport costs to and from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term. Domestic costs may face some moderate upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties," a government spokesman added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property company Kaisa Group on Tuesday announced an offshore debt restructuring agreement with a key group of bondholders, swapping existing debt into new notes and shares in the company.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-based developer has been working to restructure its offshore debt since defaulting on US$12 billion in offshore bonds in late 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The restructuring plan also covers other debts, including loans and yuan-denominated asset-backed securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa is the second-largest offshore debt issuer among Chinese developers after China Evergrande Group and in 2015 became the first among its peers to default on dollar bonds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa said in a filing it will issue six tranches of senior notes maturing from 2027 to 2032 with 5 percent-6.25 percent cash interest and eight tranches of mandatory convertible bonds maturing from 2025 to 2032, which will be converted into shares in the company based on an allocation ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To facilitate deleveraging and enhance liquidity, the company added sponsors including chairman Kwok Ying-shing may contribute 115 million yuan of shareholder loan via one or more rights issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa may also elect to propose a management incentive plan to issue up to 3.33 percent ordinary shares of Kaisa and distributed to its personnel after a tranche of the new notes has been fully redeemed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kaisa is due to face a winding-up petition hearing in Hong Kong on September 9, and a debt restructuring agreement will help to push back against the petition. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished solidly higher on Monday, extending last week's positive trend as markets await earnings from US retailers and central bank commentary.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's results from big-box chains Target, Lowe's and TJX will offer additional clues about the state of the US economy following reassuring retail sales data last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today seems to be an extension of the positive trend" from last week, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, who noted a chance that low trading volumes amid the "dog days" of summer holidays could lead to outsized market moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.6 percent at 40,896.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,608, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 17,876.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks rallied last week following encouraging US economic data that offered reassurances after recession fears buffeted markets earlier in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, chip company AMD piled on 4.5 percent after announcing a US$4.9 billion deal to acquire ZT Systems, which provides server solutions for cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  General Motors gained 1.0 percent after confirming plans to trim its software and services workforce. The auto giant will cut more than 1,000 jobs, according to US media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's calendar includes the Democratic Party's convention in Chicago, with Vice President Kamala Harris slated to deliver a headline speech on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to deliver remarks at an annual central bank gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. (AFP)

    Japan to list Tokyo Metro in autumn

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Japanese and Tokyo governments are seeking to list Tokyo Metro as early as October, according to sources. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766761_1_20240819154408.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said Japan's national and Tokyo governments were seeking a 700 billion yen valuation for the Tokyo Metro as they prepare to list the subway operator as early as the end of October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  If the deal goes ahead, it would be Japan's biggest initial public offering (IPO) in roughly six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two governments, which own 100 percent of Tokyo Metro, plan to arrange a meeting of brokerages within a week for a briefing on the IPO and expect to receive approval for the listing from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as soon as mid-September, sources told the Reuters news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half the company to be sold, the IPO could raise 350 billion yen, which would exceed the size of Kokusai Electric's IPO last year and become the largest since SoftBank Group listed its wireless unit in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IPO follows the listing of other railway operators, including Kyushu Railway (JR Kyushu) in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo Metro runs 195 kilometres of lines carrying 6.5 million passengers daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo Metro's history dates back to 1920 with the establishment of the Tokyo Underground Railway Company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven years later, it opened Japan's first subway line, between the Asakusa and Ueno districts of Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company, whose business includes real estate and retail, reported net profit jumped by two-thirds to 46 billion yen in the financial year ended March 2024 as economic activity rebounded from the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central Japanese government, which owns 53.4 percent of Tokyo Metro, plans to use the funds raised to repay reconstruction bonds issued following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tokyo government holds the remaining 46.6 percent of the subway operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nomura, Mizuho and Goldman Sachs are the joint global coordinators for the listing. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index gained 139.5 points, or 0.8 percent, to open at 17,569.66 points on Monday after hopes for an economic soft landing powered US stocks higher last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Encouraging data relieved recession worries following a brutal sell-off earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 has rebounded more than 6 percent since August 5, when a steep drop pushed the benchmark US index to its biggest three-day slide in over two years. (with additional reporting by Xinhua and Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD on Saturday announced plans to open a car production plant in Pakistan, where it will also start selling three models through a partnership with Mega Motors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BYD is the first major new electric vehicle entrant in the Pakistani market, where there is a lack of charging infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entry into the Pakistani market is not just about bringing advanced vehicles to consumers," said Liu Xueliang, BYD's general manager for Asia Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's about driving a broader vision of environmental responsibility and technological innovation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD also plans to open three "flagship stores and experience centres" in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, the company said at a launch event in Lahore, adding it plans to start selling two SUV models and a sedan from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mega Motors is a unit of Pakistan's largest private utility Hub Power Co Ltd, known as Hubco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will establish Pakistan's first NEV assembly plant... dedicated to producing BYD's cutting-edge new energy vehicles," said Hubco Chief Executive Kamran Kamal, who described the deal as a "landmark investment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new plant will begin operations in 2026, Kamal told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hubco will setup fast-charging stations across major cities, motorways and highways to enhance Pakistan's charging infrastructure. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks shook off an early slump to close higher on Friday, ending a positive week for the major indices on Wall Street, as gold prices hit a record high.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We had very big moves over the past two weeks, off the low," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments. "And now we are only five percent below the all time high."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That shows us that there is still a lot of demand for stocks at lower prices," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.2 percent at 40,659.76, the S&P 500 finished 0.2 percent higher at 5,554.25 and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day 0.2 percent higher at 17,631.72.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gold hit a new record on Friday as investors snapped up the precious metal amid increasing confidence that US rates will fall in September, weakening the US dollar. Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also increased market appetite for safe haven investments like gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders are now looking ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes of its most recent interest rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also be closely scrutinizing comments from Fed officials around the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers next weekend, according to Sarhan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You have expectations that the Fed is going to cut, the question now becomes how many times they will cut," he said. "Nobody knows, not even the Fed. It's data dependent once again." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gold hit a record high on Friday as global stock markets diverged, with profit-taking on Wall Street while European and Asian markets gained on reassuring data about the health of the world's biggest economy and likely US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Expectations of US interest rate cuts weakened the dollar, while oil prices tumbled as weak Chinese demand expectations offset turmoil in the Middle East, according to traders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gold rose to a record high of US$2,500.16 an ounce as investors snapped up the haven investment in the face of an increasingly likely US interest rate cut in September and heightened geopolitical risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sharp drop in bond yields amid expectations of rate cuts by the Fed" have pushed gold prices higher, said City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's major indices dipped at the start of trading after rallying on Thursday following stronger-than-expected retail sales data that dispelled fears the US economy is heading for a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These aren't big moves at all relative to the gains that have preceded them, yet buyers aren't rushing in to buy the dip just yet knowing the market has come a long way in a short amount of time," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the S&P 500 is up more than eight percent from its August 5 low and the Nasdaq Composite has gained 12 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices slumped more than 1.5 percent, Brent North Sea crude falling under US$80 per barrel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The significant price recovery on the oil market has run out of steam in recent days," said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For one thing, the feared retaliatory strike by Iran (on Israel) has so far failed to materialise, which has probably favoured a partial pricing out of the risk premium. In addition, new demand concerns are weighing on the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major oil producer Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel for last month's killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's labour market remains stable, with the unemployment rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive month. File photo: Xinhua" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766471_1_20240816172116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's job market remained steady, with the latest government data showing the unemployment rate at three percent between May and July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure has been unchanged since March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a government spokesperson warned the labour market could be under pressure in the short term, as changing spending habits of locals and visitors would dent consumption-related industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the jobless rate remained consistent, around 3,100 people still lost their jobs in July, joining more than 114,000 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, the labour force expanded by 8,400 to roughly 3.83 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weak domestic demand continued to weigh on consumption-related industries. The jobless rate for the retail sector worsened by 0.4 percent to 4.3 percent, while food and beverage industry hit five percent after going up three-tenths of a percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other sectors improved, notably trade and wholesale, accommodation services, transportation, insurance sector and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market "should remain tight in the near term", according to labour and welfare minister Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Statistics from the Labour Department suggest job hunters have much less choice. There were around 71,700 private-sector vacancies in July, a 31 percent decline from a year ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the three-month period ending in June, according to revised figures released by the government on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth followed a 2.8 percent increase in GDP in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, government economist Adolph Leung said he expects the economy to continue to expand, driven by strong export demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year. Exports of goods should sustain a positive performance if external demand holds up, though trade conflicts would present risks,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials kept this year's projected economic growth unchanged at 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It downgraded the projected inflation rate from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent for the year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street stocks were heading in only one direction on Thursday. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766373_1_20240816051338.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq rising more than 2 percent after July US retail sales data signaled resilient consumer spending, allaying fears of an imminent recession in the world's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Retail sales increased 1.0 percent after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent drop in June, easing fears of a sharp economic slowdown fanned by a jump in the unemployment rate last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail bellwether Walmart rose 6.58 percent after raising its annual profit forecast for the second time this year as Americans flocked to its stores for inexpensive essentials. Rivals Target and Costco also advanced 4.35 percent and 1.69 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate reading also showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The wall of worry is beginning to crumble as sentiment is improving and the fundamentals support a risk-on bias," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. "Retail sales were above expectations, Consumer Price Index numbers came in at a tolerable level, so the fundamental backdrop is consistent with rising equity prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors have cautiously eyed this week's economic data releases, the last set before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivers a much-awaited speech at Jackson Hole next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39 percent, to 40,563. The S&P 500 gained 1.61 percent, at 5,543. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.34 percent, to 17,595.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other movers, Cisco Systems rose 6.8 percent after it forecast better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and said it was cutting 7 percent of its global workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike climbed 5.07 percent as billionaire investor William Ackman built new stakes in the sportswear company. Ulta Beauty jumped 11.17 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a stake in the cosmetics store chain. (Reuters)

    Ridership, property earnings boost MTR profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR Corporation has proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766327_1_20240815183232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday reported an almost 45 percent rise in first-half profit compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by a strong recovery in ridership and earnings from property development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the railway firm conceded that passenger numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, even after patronage jumped more than four percent to surpass 950 million in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jacob Kam, the MTR's chief executive officer, said ridership had not been "very good" in the second quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe there are many factors that would affect patronage, the overall economic situation, consumers' patterns, they all play a role," Kam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to be cautiously optimistic as the economy recovers. We hope that patronage will improve over time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, the railway giant posted a net profit of HK$6 billion, up 44.7 percent from the same period in 2023. Total revenue rose 6.2 percent year-on-year to HK$29.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the MTR proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share, same as the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm also reversed its HK$774 million Hong Kong railway business loss into a profit of HK$415 million, while earnings from property development more than doubled to HK$1.74 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are making progress on 14 residential property projects. We will continue to explore property development opportunities along our existing and future railway lines, making optimal use of all land resources," Kam added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the firm will roll out more discounts for commuters, he said the corporation has to invest more than HK$100 billion for its projects in the future, and that it has to be prudent with its finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the railway giant is looking to tender the Tung Chung East project again after it failed to receive any bids last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively studying our projects and we are looking at our tender strategy. Subject to market conditions, we shall continue to orderly tender out our land parcels, in order to meet with the demands of Hong Kong," said David Tang, the firm’s property and international business director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for a land use study near Pak Shek Kok, the corporation said the assessment, which includes the possibility of constructing a new station along the East Rail Line, is still ongoing.

    China retail sales improve, but factory output slows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's factory output growth slowed and missed expectations in July, but consumption figures were better than expected for that period. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766264_1_20240815122932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales rebounded in July while industrial production growth slowed, official data showed Thursday, highlighting an uneven recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Industrial output grew 5.1 percent from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed, slowing from the 5.3 percent pace in June and below expectations for a 5.2 percent increase in a Reuters poll of analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the NBS' monthly activity indicators showed retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 2.7 percent in July, quickening from a two percent increase in June and beating expectations for growth of 2.6 percent, a sign efforts to boost household spending were getting some traction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the jobs front, China's labour market remained stable in the January-July period as the surveyed urban unemployment rate dropped on a year-on-year basis, according to NBS data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average of surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first seven months of 2024, down 0.2 percentage points from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July alone, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, up from five percent in June but still lower than 5.3 percent a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts warn the broader outlook remained challenging for policymakers, suggesting more stimulus measures will be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The data shows that the economy has gotten off to a weak start in the second half of the year, and it is expected that the probability of replacing MLF with a RRR cut will increase, but key to maintaining five percent economic growth remains the arrival of fiscal spending," said ANZ China market economist Xing Zhaopeng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was referring to the People's Bank of China's medium-term lending facility and reserve requirement ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the central bank injected cash through a short-term bond instrument and said it would conduct an MLF rollover later this month as it extends liquidity support to the financial system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's central bank at a meeting earlier this month said it would step up financial support to the broader economy and efforts would be directed more at consumers to spur consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with domestic demand weak and the outlook unclear, households and businesses are in no rush to borrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for more growth boosting measures have dogged officials ever since a widely expected post-pandemic recovery failed to materialise in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded 3.6 percent in the first seven months of 2024 year-on-year, but also missed expectations for a 3.9 percent rise and also slowed from the 3.9 percent growth in the January to June period. (Agencies and Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 ended higher on Wednesday, stretching its winning streak to five sessions, as the latest inflation data reassured investors betting the Federal Reserve would start cutting US interest rates next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also posted its fifth straight daily gain, although it barely scraped into positive territory as Alphabet and some megacap tech stocks weighed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moves were generally subdued with many investors away for August vacations, and new triggers for trading were absent, contributing to an overall listless picture among the benchmarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest US consumer price data, released earlier on Wednesday, reinforced expectations that the Fed would start interest rate cuts in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US consumer prices rose moderately in July, and the annual increase in inflation slowed to below 3 percent for the first time since early 2021. A day earlier, softer-than-expected producer prices data indicated inflation continued to moderate, although not yet all the way to the US central bank's 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments, said he called days such as this "markets violently going nowhere", adding with CPI painting a similar picture to PPI data, there was no reason for traders to reassess moves put in place on the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no huge rationale to move prices one way or another," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 closed at 5,455, up 0.38 percent. The Nasdaq Composite closed at 17,193, up 0.03 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.61 percent at 40,008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Alphabet, the Google-parent, dropped 2.3 percent on a media report that the US Department of Justice is considering options that include breaking up the online search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other megacaps were mixed: Tesla slumped 3.1 percent and Meta Platforms dropped 0.3 percent, while Microsoft fell 0.7 percent and Nvidia declined 1.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rebound in megacap and tech stocks has helped markets recoup most losses from a global market rout early this month after data showed the U.S. unemployment rate surged in July. (Reuters)

    Mars swallows Pringles maker in US$36bn deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pringles will now be part of a snack empire that also includes Mars products. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766209_1_20240815034438.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family-owned candy giant Mars is buying Cheez-It maker Kellanova in a nearly US$36 billion deal, bringing together brands from M&M's and Snickers to Pringles and Pop-Tarts in the year's biggest deal to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mars said on Wednesday it will pay US$83.50 per share for Kellanova, representing about a 33 percent premium to its closing price on August 2 before it was first reported that Mars was exploring a deal for the maker of frozen breakfast foods, such as Morningstar Farms and Eggo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal is a bet on consumers continuing to indulge in branded snacks, and comes as packaged food companies face stalling growth after years of price hikes to cover sky-rocketing inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The combined company aims to hold prices steady, said Mars CEO Poul Weihrauch, and not pass on costs from the deal to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a big and stronger company," Weihrauch said. "We hope to be able to absorb more costs in our structure and help alleviate the issues we have in an inflationary environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Food prices in the United States increased roughly 25 percent from 2019 through 2023, far more than other categories such as housing and medical care, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture. But inflation has started to moderate, according to the US consumer price index data released on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumers in the United States and Europe – major markets for both companies – have been looking for cheaper alternatives or ditching brands for cheaper private label goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kellanova has seen private label encroach on its market share for cereal in Europe and other areas, said CEO Steve Cahillane. The company sells sweet cereals such as Smacks, Frosties and Coco Pops in Europe, according to securities filings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US packaged food sector is seeing robust dealmaking as companies seek scale to weather the impact of inflation-weary consumers cutting back and shifting their purchases to private label brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think an environment more conducive to deal-making could also encourage some of the large-cap packaged food names within the industry to shift their focus away from portfolio cleanup and divestiture efforts and towards a more offensive, acquisition-led posture with a focus on growth," Barclays analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The infrastructure arm of Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison conglomerate announced on Wednesday that it would put in place a secondary share listing on the London Stock Exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure Holdings said in an announcement that it had sought permission from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, and expected to begin trading in its shares on the London bourse’s main market on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The company believes that a listing in London, in addition to the Company’s listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will benefit its geographically diverse shareholder base and will assist in building the company’s profile and provide a greater market for trading in the shares,” CK said.

  Second-quarter revenue climbed 8 percent to 161.1 billion yuan, driven by a recovery in its gaming business after a launch of a new mobile game in May that got off to a strong start.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tech giant Foxconn on Wednesday reported a six percent jump in net profit for the second quarter of the year, driven by strong growth in demand for artificial intelligence servers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple supplier Foxconn on Wednesday reported a six percent rise in second-quarter net profit, driven by strong AI server demand as the company touted "strong growth momentum" from the technology boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's largest contract electronics maker, said net profit for the April-June quarter rose to US$1.09 billion from US$1.02 billion in the same period the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That beat analysts' average estimate of US$1.06 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the firm's fourth consecutive quarterly profit rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said AI servers accounted for more than 40 percent of its server business in the second quarter, saying its next generation AI computing solution had brought "strong growth momentum."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foxconn had previously expected revenue for the second quarter to grow significantly from a year earlier, although revenue from smart computer electronics including smartphones was likely to be flattish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company expected its operations to pick up gradually in the second half as many electronics vendors, including Apple, usually release new products ahead of the year-end holiday season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a report prior to the earnings announcement, Taipei-based KGI Securities revised up its sales forecast for Foxconn this year, saying strong demand for new iPhones and AI servers were likely to lead to a better-than-expected outlook for the firm in the second half. (Reuters)
