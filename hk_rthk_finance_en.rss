<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks cheered a benign US inflation report on Friday, powering the market to a positive conclusion to the week despite weakness in tech shares in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report showed that the personal consumption expenditures price index eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in June, from 2.6 percent, amounting to progress in a key US Federal Reserve indicator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut interest rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones jumped 1.6 percent to 40,589.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 percent to 5,459, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.0 percent to 17,357.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Wednesday, led by a rout in tech shares, which have been seen as overvalued after strong gains in the first half of 2024. Despite the Nasdaq's bounce on Friday, the index finished the week down more than two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to have slowing inflation and solid growth," conditions "consistent with a soft landing thesis," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kourkafas expects more of a "rotation" away from technology to other sectors in the upcoming period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, 3M shot up around 23 percent after reporting better-than-expected earnings and lifting its full-year profit forecast. Analysts see the industrial heavyweight as well positioned following progress on major litigation issues that have dogged the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biogen dove 7.2 percent after announcing European officials gave a negative reading on a new Alzheimer's disease treatment. Biogen and partner Eisai said they would seek a reexamination of the decision.
  <br/>

    US stocks mixed after strong GDP figures

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Investors were surprised by the GDP numbers, which came in well above economists' estimates. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763186_1_20240726045730.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Thursday as traders contended with corporate earnings and economic data that came in far stronger than expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy surprised analysts by growing at an annualised rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter of the year – double the level seen between January and March, and well above economists' estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 0.2 percent at 39,935, while the S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to close at 5,399.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also finished the day in the red, declining by 0.9 percent to 17,181.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a strong economic report, so that helped boost investors' enthusiasm," Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin said. "But we also had some a mixed picture on the micro front."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had some disappointments out of Ford, American Airlines, so I think that it's creating perhaps a little tension in the market today," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, US auto giant Ford fell by 18.4 percent after missing earnings expectations, leading a sell-off in the sector that left General Motors and Stellantis down 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some cause for optimism as well on Thursday, with health care services provider Molina and digital workflow firm ServiceNow both finishing the day up, by 12.3 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors' attention is also firmly fixed on Friday's inflation data, which is sure to be closely scrutinised ahead of next week's Federal Reserve interest rate decision. (AFP)

    US rejects plan for G20 deal to tax super-rich

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Janet Yellen says all countries should make sure their taxation systems are fair and progressive. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763185_1_20240726021119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States sees no need to negotiate an international agreement on taxing the super-wealthy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, highlighting divisions on a plan that is top of the agenda at a G20 finance ministers' meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taxing the ultra-rich is a key priority of Brazil's leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who this year heads the G20 grouping of the world's major economies, the European Union and African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tax policy is very difficult to coordinate globally," Yellen told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro, ahead of an evening meeting between finance ministers to discuss the topic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see a need or really think it's desirable to try to negotiate a global agreement on that. We think that all countries should make sure that their taxation systems are fair and progressive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen said Washington was "strongly supportive of progressive taxation, and making sure that very wealthy, high-income individuals pay their fair share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She highlighted policies proposed by US President Joe Biden, such as a billionaires' tax, which she described as "a very worthwhile initiative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It makes sense for most countries to take this approach of progressive taxation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's search for a global agreement on taxing the richest of the rich is backed by France, Spain, South Africa, Colombia and the African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some individuals control more resources than entire countries," Lula said on Wednesday at the launch of an initiative to fight world hunger, another project topping his G20 agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His finance minister, Fernando Haddad, told local media on Wednesday that taxing billionaires would help finance the fight against hunger but "it will not be established overnight, because it is a very delicate mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global inequality has continued to widen in recent years, according to a study by the NGO Oxfam published on Thursday. The richest one percent of the world have earned more than US$40 trillion in a decade, but their taxation is at "historically" low rates, the study said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French economist Gabriel Zucman, a consultant with the G20 on taxation issues, estimates that the tax rate for billionaires represents 0.3 percent of their wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent report commissioned by the G20, he called for super-wealthy individuals to be taxed the equivalent of two percent of their fortune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington is not the only sceptic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the eve of the G20 meeting, Germany's finance ministry said it considers the idea of a minimum wealth tax to be "irrelevant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting of finance ministers in Rio opened with a session on the global economy, as inflation slows in many parts of the world after a surge fuelled by the war in Ukraine and other factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the ministers will tackle the financing of the climate transition and debt in their last meeting before a G20 summit on November 18 and 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Founded in 1999, the Group of 20 assembles 19 of the world's largest economic powers, as well as the European Union and the African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation was originally focused on global economic issues but has increasingly taken on other pressing challenges – even though member states do not always agree on what should be on the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's presidency said in a statement that some members of the G20 considered that crises such as the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza "have an impact on the global economy and should be addressed at the G20, while others believe that the G20 is not the place to discuss these issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisions within the G20, of which Russia is also a member, have made drafting a joint communique at the outcome of meetings a challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last meeting of finance ministers in Sao Paulo failed to issue such a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil hopes to publish three texts after the meeting, said Tatiana Rosito, a senior official at the country's economy ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aside from a joint final communique, this would include a document on "international cooperation in tax matters" and a separate communique from Brazil on geopolitical crises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is likely, based on my experience of previous G20s," that future ministerial-level meetings will publish separate statements in this manner, European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming for a single text "would not allow us to adopt anything," she said. (AFP)

    US economy beats growth expectations in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Commerce Department says the acceleration "primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending." Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763181_1_20240726012528.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US economic growth blew past expectations in the second quarter, boosted by consumer spending and inventory building despite high interest rates, US government data showed on Thursday, after a slow start to the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy grew 2.8 percent in the April to June period, up from 1.4 percent in the first three months this year, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial estimate was markedly above the 1.9 percent growth rate economists anticipated – a reassuring sign that consumption remains resilient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acceleration "primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending," said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was "partly offset by a downturn in residential fixed investment," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While sectors like manufacturing and housing have been struggling after the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked interest rates in 2022 to combat surging inflation, consumption has been stronger than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This gave the economy a boost despite rates hovering at their highest levels in more than two decades – making borrowing more expensive for individuals and companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key factor underpinning consumption has been the robust labour market, which saw continued wage growth and businesses reluctant to let go of workers after difficulties in hiring during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With inflation slowing and salaries still growing, economists said consumers' real disposable income gains became bigger, allowing them to keep dipping into their wallets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the economy outperforming predictions of possible recession, President Joe Biden has struggled to assuage concerns of many Americans feeling the pinch from higher costs of living.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his shock exit from the 2024 election, it remains to be seen if that negative sentiment will transfer to his likely Democratic replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see consumption continuing to be the engine of the economy, continuing to keep economic growth on a relatively strong growth path of around two percent," said economist Matthew Martin of Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that although unemployment has been edging up, the trend has more to do with entrances into the market rather than layoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This means it is not the start of a cycle where unemployment leads to income loss, in turn reducing spending and triggering more job losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there remain risks to the economy as unemployment tends to "shoot up" quickly, he said, noting that is not currently an expected outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's a big case to begin cutting rates in September and follow up with one every other meeting from there," he said of the US Federal Reserve's policymaking committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maintaining excessively restrictive monetary policy when the labour market appears to be fully back in balance could lead to an undesired weakening of employment growth and the economy," said EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a recent note. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Thursday cut a medium-term interest rate, marking the latest move by the authorities to boost economic growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's central bank cut the rate for its medium-term lending facility (MLF) – the interest for one-year loans to financial institutions – to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC issued 200 billion yuan in one-year loans under its MLF at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time the rate was cut was in August but the latest is the biggest since April 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marco Sun, chief financial market analyst at MUFG Bank (China), said Thursday's move could reduce the cost of financing and release cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unexpected MLF operation was also due to a large amount of MLF loans coming due, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the People's Bank of China cut two benchmark lending rates, days after the Communist Party's third plenary session which outlined major reforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, major commercial banks announced reductions in deposit rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank was cut by 10 basis points to 1.35 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first deposit rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024. (Agencies)

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 50.22 points, or 0.29 percent, to open at 17,260.83 points on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Traders are taking a cautious stance ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures price index data, which is the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation and therefore plays a major role in its view on interest rates..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight in the US, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at multi-week lows, with the S&P snapping one of its longest streaks without a daily decline of more than 2 percent, as lacklustre Alphabet and Tesla earnings undermined investor confidence in large company names.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13. (with additional reporting by Xinhua and Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets tumbled on Wednesday following a bruising investor response to earnings from Tesla and Google parent Alphabet that added to worries about tech heavyweight equity valuations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downbeat reaction to results "feeds some angst about the mega cap stocks not being able to deliver stock performance," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, adding that even strong results next week from Apple, Amazon and other tech giants may not be received well by Wall Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a general bid to reduce exposure predicated on the idea that these stocks have run up a long way in a short time," O'Hare said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla dropped 12.3 percent after missing earnings estimates as CEO Elon Musk touted progress on robotic and artificial intelligence technology. Analysts said the results added to worries about weakening profit margins amid ebbing demand for Tesla's electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Alphabet fell 5.0 percent after topping analyst estimates in general but reporting disappointing figures for its YouTube business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among economic reports, the sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Federal Reserve's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides corporate earnings, Thursday's calendar includes the US government estimate for second-quarter growth. (AFP)

    New home sales in US miss expectations

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates, according to government data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New home sales in June came in at an annual, seasonally-adjusted, rate of 617,000, according to data released jointly by the US census and housing departments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was below the 621,000 rate in May, according to Wednesday's revised figures, and under the 640,000 projected by analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure refers to the number of homes sold over a whole year if sales continue at the rate seen in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median price in June was US$417,3000, up 2.5 percent from the prior reading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data follows a report that also showed a drop in sales of previously-owned homes that also missed analyst estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The June report on top of the weak May data show the "spring bounce in sales appears to have reversed," said a note from Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage rates currently stand below their four-week and 52-week average, according to Freddie Mac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, interest rates remain well above their levels for most of the last decade following a series of large Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to counter inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Fed's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New home sales are expected "to improve slightly" in the second half of the year, according to a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mortgage rates have fallen nearly 50 basis points to about 6.75 percent since early May and we expect rates to fall further as the Fed's rate cutting cycle gets underway," said the Oxford Economics note. (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index fell 14.93 points, or 0.09 percent, to open at 17,454.43 points on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank's monetary policy is back in focus ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data - the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the US, attention turned to corporate earnings, with Google parent Alphabet and electric carmaker Tesla both reporting results after Wall Street closed on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its earnings, Tesla reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits due to the effect of price cuts, while Alphabet beat revenue and profit expectations as its cloud and search ads businesses thrived. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished a choppy session slightly lower on Tuesday as investors assessed mixed earnings reports while monitoring the fast-changing US presidential contest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lockheed Martin, Spotify and Sherwin-Williams rallied, while General Motors and UPS both fell on a busy day of second-quarter corporate results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com said of the overall muted market reaction that there was "not a lot of conviction" after Monday's solid rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.1 percent at 40,358.09.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,555.71, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.1 percent to 17,997.35.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than two days after President Joe Biden pulled out of the November election, Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail in the battleground state of Wisconsin as she continued to lock up major endorsements from Democratic officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect the stock market to monitor the race more intensely closer to the November election date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, UPS sank more than 12.1 percent as it reported lower profits and revenues and cut some annual projections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM dropped 6.4 percent despite reporting profits that topped estimates. Analysts noted that the automaker had seen shares appreciate significantly heading into the report and also pointed to weakness in its China business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Spotify jumped 12 percent as it announced that it added seven million paid subscribers in the second quarter, beating forecasts after it raised prices. (AFP)

    North American sales help cushion GM from China woes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Strong North American sales helped offset weakness in China, with General Motors reporting US$2.9 billion in quarterly profit. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762879_1_20240724034127.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 General Motors reported higher profits on Tuesday behind another round of strong North American auto sales, with executives vowing a flexible approach to electric vehicle (EV) investment while demand growth ebbs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The major US automaker's second-quarter results demonstrated a continued lift from robust pricing in its home market, thanks to healthy demand for trucks that has made up for weakness in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM, like fellow Michigan automaker Ford, has slowed down its EV build-out, pushing back another project even as company officials emphasized a long-term commitment to the strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we go forward, we're going to bring additional capacity online in a measured cadence," said Chief Executive Mary Barra, pointing to third-party studies showing slower EV growth in the coming period compared with the last few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Profits came in at US$2.9 billion, up 14 percent from the year-ago period while revenues rose seven percent to US$48 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM increased some of its full-year projections based on the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North American auto sales rose compared with the year-ago period, with the company enjoying still-strong vehicle pricing that has lasted longer than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barra, in a letter to shareholders, pointed to "consistently high performing portfolio of ICE (internal combustion engine) trucks and SUVs on a volume, share and margin basis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM continued to struggle in China, where competition among car companies is high and the company suffered a second consecutive quarterly loss in equity income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competitors are "prioritizing production over profitability," said Barra, who plans to revamp a joint venture with Chinese company SAIC in hopes of a turnaround.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you get into the type of pricing where that's going on now, it's really a race to the bottom," Barra said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM noted that the company's Cruise autonomous vehicles service has returned to the road in three cities -- Phoenix, Dallas and Houston -- after a pause due to safety issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise is employing a driverless taxi model in these three cities, with a safety driver present to take over if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has not resumed service in California. Authorities halted testing of Cruise vehicles in the state in October 2023 following a series of accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM accounted for US$605 million in costs in the second quarter due to a production halt on the Cruise Origin, which had been planned as a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel. (AFP)

    Wall Street jumps as investors return to megacaps

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street finished higher in a strong session for big tech stocks. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762727_1_20240723050656.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's three benchmarks ended higher on Monday as investors returned to megacap growth stocks, helping both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recover from their worst weekly performance since April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also back in positive territory, breaking a two-session skid since hitting an all-time closing high last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacaps Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Tesla all advanced between 2.2 percent and 5.1 percent after being major drags on the market last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia also rose 4.8 percent% after Reuters reported the artificial intelligence chip leader was working on a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market that would be compliant with current US export controls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think this move today probably has more to do with a rebound from the selling that occurred last week than anything else," said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy & research at Glenmede.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief among the other factors on traders' minds was a re-examination of the state of the presidential race after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy for the November election on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's exit could prompt investors to unwind trades on bets that a victory for Republican Trump would increase US fiscal and inflationary pressures. But some analysts said markets could benefit from an increased chance of a divided government under the next administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump-linked stocks were mixed on Monday, with Trump Media & Technology Group dropping 0.8 percent, while software firm Phunware gained 4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having digested the news of Biden's withdrawal, investors will now be looking for answers to key questions including who will join Harris on the Democratic presidential ticket and to what degree, if any, the vice president will deviate from the platform which Biden was headlining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.08 percent, at 5,564 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.58 percent, to 18,008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent, to 40,415.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike slumped 13.5 percent, extending losses after a software update from the company sparked Friday's global tech outage. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Economists are anticipating more interest rate cuts by the mainland’s central bank this year, after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced the reduction of two benchmark rates on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The PBOC lowered the one-year loan prime rate from 3.45 percent to 3.35 percent, and the five-year rate from 3.95 percent to 3.85 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Greater China Economist at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking Michelle Lam said the rate cuts came earlier than expected, but she predicts the trims to have a limited impact on the mainland's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't think that a 10 basis point cut will be a game changer. And also right now, there's a lot of weak confidence among households. So probably it will not be very impactful in terms of boosting household consumption," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But still, it's better than not doing anything. So there will still be maybe somewhat marginally positive [impact] to support the domestic demand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate cuts came after the mainland saw slower-than-forecast economic growth of 4.7 percent in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hunter Chan, a Greater China Economist at Standard Chartered, said he believes the rate reductions will provide some support to the mainland's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cutting is to strengthen the countercyclical adjustment and to support the real economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we suggest the economy needs more supporting measures. And I guess the central bank also acted on that, to provide enough support to the real economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said he expects there will be at least one 10 basis point rate cut in the fourth quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC on Monday also lowered the interest rates on its standing lending facility, a type of loans that it lends to commercial banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The overnight, seven-day and one-month rates were cut by 10 basis points to 2.55 percent, 2.7 percent and 3.05 percent respectively.

    Three jailed in landmark market manipulation trial

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people have been jailed for up to six years and eight months after being convicted in a high-profile market manipulation case, with a High Court judge saying the trio had damaged the city's status as a financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sit Yi-ki, Lam Wing-ki and Tam Cheuk-hang were found guilty of conspiracy to carry out false trading in the shares of Hong Kong-listed construction services company Ching Lee Holdings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence on Monday, deputy High Court judge Douglas Yau said it was a "meticulously planned and executed conspiracy" which threatened the integrity of the market, and therefore sentences serving as a deterrent were needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission, which brought the case, said the conspirators artificially increased the turnover of the shares by conducting manipulative trading activities among 156 securities accounts in 2016, while netting illicit profits of more than HK$124 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ploy began before Ching Lee's listing on March 29, 2016 and lasted for more than five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The manipulative activities inflated Ching Lee's share price by as much as 2,000 percent and it reached a historic high of HK$5.98 on July 13. It closed at HK$4.87 on September 6, before a collapse of 90 percent the following day to HK$0.45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission's executive director of enforcement, Christopher Wilson, said the sentences are the longest ever handed down by a court for a market manipulation offence under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It sends a very strong and clear message that we will not tolerate any continuous and further misdoings. This is also the first time that one of our cases has been heard before the High Court before a jury," he told reporters after the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined to root out all forms of market manipulation, to protect investors and uphold the integrity of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other people alleged to have been involved in the case are currently wanted by the authorities.

 The Hong Kong market opened higher on Monday amid an announcement by the mainland central bank to cut two key lending rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index gained 47 points or 0.27 percent at 17,465.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland stocks were mixed on Monday, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index down 0.14 percent to open at 2,978.19 points and the Shenzhen Component Index 0.06 percent higher at 8,908.21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the People's Bank of China announced it was cutting two key rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.35 percent from 3.45 percent previously, while the five-year LPR was reduced by the same margin to 3.85 percent from 3.95 percent .

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell decisively for a second straight session on Friday following a major IT outage that roiled many businesses at a time when analysts consider the market "overbought."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Airlines, banks, TV stations and financial institutions were among those thrown into turmoil due to a faulty update to an antivirus programme for Windows systems from American cybersecurity group CrowdStrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outage added more uncertainty at a time when markets were already edgy over speculation that President Joe Biden will withdraw from the 2024 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 40,287.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.7 percent to 5,505, while the Nasdaq declined 0.8 percent to 17,726.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The market was extremely overbought so it was just a matter of time before we had a pullback," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far it has been relatively mild and I think earnings are going to be an important factor as to whether" the market keeps falling, Cahill said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Netflix fell 1.5 percent despite adding eight million new subscribers in the second quarter. But some analysts said the company's third-quarter revenue forecast was disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other companies reporting results, Travelers sank 7.7 percent, while American Express fell 2.7 percent and Schlumberger advanced 2.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company at the heart of the global outage, tumbled 11.1 percent. CEO George Kurtz announced that a fix had been rolled out for the problem.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday as most large tech shares continued a retreat while a closely watched risk index pushed higher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech shares have been under pressure in recent days amid talk that the market is "overbought" after a torrid run so far in 2024 on bullishness over artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "VIX" volatility index rose about 10 percent in a move that some market watchers tied to political pressure building on President Joe Biden to exit the 2024 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones dropped 1.3 percent to 40,665, retreating after three straight records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,544, while the Nasdaq declined 0.7 percent to 17,871.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses were broad-based, with energy the only one of 11 industrial sectors to advance in the S&P 500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, noted that Thursday's losses were broad-based and included smaller equities that had benefited in recent days from the tech selloff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't take much of an excuse for markets to take some profits when they've had such a good run," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding politics, Hogan said, "the market doesn't like uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spartan Capital's Peter Cardillo said speculation about Biden "could create some short-term election anxiety" after more investors expected a win by Donald Trump following their June presidential debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Central Bank meanwhile held borrowing costs steady, giving policymakers more time to assess progress on inflation after last month's first interest rate cut in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United Airlines shed 1.2 percent after reporting higher profits in the second quarter but cautioning that it would trim back capacity later in 2024 due to excess flights in the US market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DR Horton jumped 10 percent after reporting higher profits and revenues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited, and demographics supporting housing demand continue to be favourable," said David Auld, executive chairman of the homebuilder. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 TSMC on Thursday said it expects third-quarter revenue to surge by as much as 34 percent from a year earlier after the world's largest contract chipmaker posted a quarterly net profit that beat market expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier for US tech giants Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards the adoption of AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TSMC's April-June net profit climbed to T$247.8 billion (US$7.60 billion) from T$181.8 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The profit beat a T$238.8 billion forecast for the quarter which ended June 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said second-quarter revenue rose 33 percent year-on-year to US$20.8 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of between US$19.6 billion and US$20.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue for the current quarter is expected to be at least US$22.4 billion compared with US$17.3 billion in the same period last year. (Reuters)

    Tech shares tumble as Dow ends at 3rd straight record

Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762040_1_20240718045151.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished decisively lower on Wednesday after talk that tech equities are overbought, while the Dow pushed to a third straight record high.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts described the development as an inevitable cooling in large tech names including Facebook parent Meta and artificial intelligence player Nvidia, after outsized gains in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow, however, continued to benefit from an inflow of funds to underperforming names from other sectors. The blue-chip index finished up 0.6 percent at 41,198.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent to 5,588, while the Nasdaq slumped 2.8 percent to 17,996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen a relentless rally and a pause might be healthy at this point," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, we had some concerns around semiconductors and chip makers which have been under pressure. And that's been kind of adding to the rotation narrative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Data showed that US industrial production cooled in June but still exceeded analyst expectations, with manufacturing and utilities output both rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Federal Reserve report said there has been "slight to modest" growth in economic activity in most parts of the country over recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A growing number of districts have, however, reported "flat or declining activity," said the Fed's "beige book" survey of economic conditions, which pointed to November's US presidential election and inflation as contributing to uncertainty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Johnson & Johnson rose 3.7 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits on a 4.3 percent increase in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drug and medical device company expressed confidence as it pursues regulatory approval of new products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JB Hunt Transport Services fell 6.9 percent after reporting lower profits on a seven-percent slide in revenues as the trucking and logistics company contends with tepid demand. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lands Department on Wednesday announced the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Hung Kai Properties beat 10 other bidders and won the tender for a site in Siu Lek Yuen, Sha Tin, for HK$619 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site is expected to generate around 280 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the only residential plot on offer in the April-June quarter under the government land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Victor Lui, said the company will build small and medium-sized units there, with a total investment of around HK$2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kathy Lee, head of research at Colliers, said the government's first successful sale of residential land after scrapping property-cooling measures in February sent a positive message to the market, amid concerns that developers were reluctant to bid for land.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC announced that Georges Elhedery will become the new group CEO. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761942_1_20240717132925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC on Wednesday named chief financial officer Georges Elhedery as the bank's next chief executive to drive "the next phase of development and growth".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to confirm Georges as the next HSBC Group Chief Executive," group chairman Mark Tucker said in a filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board concluded that Georges was the outstanding candidate and we look forward to working together as he leads HSBC through the next phase of development and growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery will take over on September 2 from current CEO Noel Quinn, who announced his retirement in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery joined HSBC in 2005 and previously held the role of Co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets before being appointed chief financial officer in January 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanon-born, French-educated banker also led the bank's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkey region from July 2016 to February 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before assuming the role of CFO in 2023, Elhedery had a six-month sabbatical that included spending time learning Mandarin, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery has a "track record of leading through change, driving growth, delivering simplification, containing costs and brings a strong focus on execution," Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery said he was "deeply honoured" by HSBC's trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory," he said in the filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC said it would announce the next chief financial officer in due course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn would work with Elhedery to ensure a "smooth and orderly" handover before stepping down, the bank added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn, 62, oversaw a transformation of the London-headquartered lender and saw record profits during almost five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under him, the bank accelerated a years-long pivot to Asia -- where it generates most of its revenue -- vowing to develop its wealth business and target fast-growing markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank concluded the sales of its Canadian operations and its retail bank operations in France. It will also sell its Argentina division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn last year led the effort to repel a bid by major shareholder Ping An to spin off its Asia assets, with the proposal eventually voted down by shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The break-up bid highlighted HSBC's precarious position amid US-China tensions, with some observers questioning whether Europe's largest lender can continue to straddle East and West. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to another record on Tuesday on bullish reaction to positive earnings reports amid optimism over the rising likelihood of US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The blue-chip index piled on 1.9 percent or more than 740 points to finish at 40,954.48, posting a second straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,667.20, also a record, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent to 18,509.34.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The records were driven partly by outsized gains for Bank of America and Dow member UnitedHealth Group following earnings reports, as well as an ongoing rotation of funds towards smaller companies that have underperformed in 2024 but are expected to be boosted by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides UnitedHealth, the Dow's biggest gainers included industrial giants Boeing and Caterpillar. (AFP)

    US retail sales flat in June as consumption cools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the US Department of Commerce. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761856_1_20240716215636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States slipped less than analysts anticipated in June on a weaker performance in the auto and gas segments, government data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The slower consumption growth adds to recent data showing that the world's biggest economy is cooling gradually – a trend likely to raise the central bank's confidence that it can soon begin cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To ease demand and bring inflation back down sustainably, the Federal Reserve has rapidly lifted the benchmark lending rate and in recent months, held it at a decades-high level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the Department of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, May's increase was revised slightly higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, the rise in June was 2.3 percent, a cooldown from the prior month as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have long been expecting consumers to pull back as higher interest rates bite, lifting borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that consumption growth will, if anything, slow further in [the second half this year], as high interest rates continue to weigh on demand and the labour market takes a further turn for the worse," said Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among sectors, sales at auto dealers dropped 2.3 percent from May, while those at gas stations dropped three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But excluding auto and gas, total retail sales was up 0.8 percent in June – indicating that there may still be some way to go yet in easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales at restaurants and bars was up 0.3 percent from a month prior, the Commerce Department report showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is set to make its next rate decision at the end of July, and analysts widely expect the central bank to begin lowering rates in September. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The IMF held its global growth expectations for 2024 steady in a report on Tuesday even as it cut forecasts for the United States and Japan, while warning of inflation risks and trade tensions ahead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to grow 3.2 percent this year, unchanged from its April forecast, according to its World Economic Outlook update.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports from Asia, particularly in the technology sector," said the fund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For 2025, it expects global growth of 3.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even as many countries saw better growth than anticipated in the first three months this year, the IMF flagged what it called notable surprises in Japan and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington-based lender also cautioned that upside risks to inflation have increased, with services prices holding up disinflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated for longer, "in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An area of concern is trade and industrial policy, with countries potentially adopting measures that impact the global economy's integration, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if risk assessments have shifted after the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump, the Republican Party's nominee in November's election, Gourinchas noted the fund will consider its implications. (AFP)

    China's economy slows in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's economy grew 4.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, less than analysts had expected. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761623_1_20240715111349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy expanded at a slower-than-forecast 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, the government reported on Monday, while emphasising signs of improvement in factory output, income and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter growth was below the 5.3 percent seen in the first quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists said weak consumer demand and reduced government spending were dragging on growth in the world's No. 2 economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first six months of 2024, the economy expanded by five percent, in line with the country's growth forecast for the entire year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail sales slowed to two percent growth in June, official data showed, suggesting continued struggles to boost consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In June, the total retail sales of consumer goods went up by 2.0 percent year on year," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. May's figure was 3.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were up 3.7 percent year on year in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial output, meanwhile, climbed 5.3 percent year on year last month, and rose 6 percent for the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS attributed the weaker second-quarter GDP growth to short-term factors such as extreme weather and floods, but said it also reflected rising challenges, especially from insufficient effective demand and unsmooth economic flow at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, the national economy has continued to improve in the first half in a stable manner," the NBS said in a statement, citing support from policy incentives, rebound in external demand and development of new quality productive forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Yeung, a chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that weak retail sales dragged down GDP growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's also very consistent with our on-the-ground observations in different cities in China. Of course you don't notice that when Hong Kong people go to Shenzhen. But in other cities, which is clearly more domestic, the consumption level is clearly weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release of the latest economic figures came as leaders of the Communist Party gathered for a once-a-decade conclave to set economic policy that was expected to focus on self-sufficient strategies for growth in an era of tensions over trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-day meeting of the Communist Party’s 205-member Central Committee is the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, President and party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a work report on behalf of the Politburo at the start of the third plenum and expounded on a draft decision on further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such meetings typically focus on long-term issues, but business owners and investors are watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged downturn in the property market and boost the country's post-pandemic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the third plenary session has to focus on stabilising employment, noting reports of layoffs and salary cuts in the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately, what we need is to have a stable labour market and stable employment so that households will be more confident in spending. And that wage dynamic is the most important area the policymakers really need to focus on in the future," he said. (RTHK/Agencies)

    Pakistan pledges US$7 billion IMF aid deal is last

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761475_1_20240713213426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund has agreed to loan Pakistan US$7 billion to bolster its faltering economy, with Islamabad pledging on Saturday it would be the last time it relied on relief from the Washington-based lender.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South Asian nation agreed to the deal – its 24th IMF payout since 1958 – in exchange for unpopular reforms, including widening its chronically low tax base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan last year came to the brink of default as the economy shrivelled amid political chaos following catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement, as well as a global economic downturn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries, as well as an IMF rescue package, but its finances remain in dire straits, with high inflation and staggering public debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This programme should be considered the last programme," Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told ministers and revenue officials in Islamabad. "We should tax those who are not being taxed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan announced on Friday, which will be paid out over three years subject to approval by the organisation's Executive Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came on condition of far-reaching reforms including hiking household bills to remedy a permanently crisis-stricken energy sector and uplifting pitiful tax takings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a nation of over 240 million people and where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the 2024-25 fiscal year that started at the beginning of July, the government aims to raise nearly US$46 billion in taxes, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More unusual methods have seen the tax authority block 210,000 SIM cards of mobile users who have not filed tax returns in a bid to widen the revenue bracket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the deal "revenue collections will be supported by simpler and fairer direct and indirect taxation including by bringing net income from the retail, export, and agriculture sectors properly into the tax system", IMF Pakistan Mission Chief Nathan Porter said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islamabad also aims to reduce its fiscal deficit by 1.5 percent to 5.9 percent in the coming year, heeding another key IMF demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF said the loan and its conditions should allow Pakistan to "cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Pakistan's public debt remains huge at US$242 billion, and servicing it will still swallow up half of the government's income in 2024, according to the IMF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have criticised Islamabad's measures as surface-level reforms aimed at courting the IMF without addressing underlying problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to not see old patterns in this new IMF deal," said Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The IMF has issued a loan similar in size and conditions as the one agreed to five years ago, and five years before that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will authorities seize the opportunity thus created to embark on fundamental reforms to how the country is run?" he asked. "You would be well-advised not to hold your breath."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Sharif came to power in February elections marred by allegations of rigging, with ex-PM Imran Khan jailed and barred from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The diet of strict economic measures introduced by his shaky coalition government is likely to undermine their popularity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have already been scattered protests over tax and bill hikes introduced in last month's budget – prepared with IMF oversight – and more demonstrations are scheduled for the coming weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While around 40 percent of the population already lives below the poverty line, the World Bank said in April it feared that 10 million additional Pakistanis would fall below this threshold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's last US$3 billion loan from the IMF in 2023 proved a lifeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also came on the condition of unpopular austerity measures, including an end to subsidies cushioning consumer costs. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their upward climb on Friday, shrugging off disappointing inflation data and a poor response to bank earnings amid expectations of easing US monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US wholesale inflation rose 0.2 percent in June, more than expected, according to Labour Department data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Friday's data was not bad enough to overshadow Thursday's benign consumer price index report that boosted expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, analysts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.6 percent at 40,000, just shy of a closing record set in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 also gained 0.6 percent to 5,615, along with the Nasdaq, which closed at 18,398. Both indices had dropped on Thursday, ending a multi-day stretch of records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yesterday's decline appears to be a one-off and it's not leading to more selling," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments, who considers the current dynamics a bull market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit large bank after earnings was Wells Fargo, which sank 6.0 percent as it reported lower profits due in part to a decline in net interest income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase also fell more than one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The air taxi startup Archer Aviation soared 10.4 percent after announcing a partnership with Southwest Airlines to provide aircraft in California. Southwest rose 2.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AT&T shed 0.2 percent after disclosing a massive data breach in which hackers stole call and message data from virtually all of its customers for six months in 2022 – around 90 million people. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US wholesale prices picked up more than expected in June due to service costs, the government reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.2 percent last month, while an initially-reported decline in May was revised upwards, said the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures come after a cooler than expected consumer inflation reading, which fanned hopes of the US central bank cutting interest rates as soon as September.

  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve has been battling to bring stubborn inflation back to its longer-term two percent target by keeping rates high, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has noted "modest" progress on prices recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, government data showed the consumer price index – a key gauge of inflation – rose 3.0 percent from a year ago, a slowdown from 3.3 percent in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said the latest PPI data is unlikely to worry the Fed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the PPI report, a 0.6 percent increase in services costs bumped the overall index higher, the Labour Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, PPI rose 2.6 percent in June, the largest gain since increasing 2.7 percent in March 2023, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an underlying measure stripping out food, energy and trade services was unchanged in June after a 0.2 percent rise in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some analysts expect the Fed could signal in its July meeting that it intends to lower rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although slightly hotter than expected, a modest rise in the producer price index for June still keeps input prices on a supportive path for cooler inflation prints ahead," said Ben Ayers, senior economist for Nationwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a media interview on Thursday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said: "I do think with the incoming information on inflation, growth and the labour market, some policy adjustments are likely to be warranted." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s exports rose at their fastest in 15 months in June, customs data showed Friday, while imports declined.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy grew 8.6 percent year-on-year in value last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That marked a third consecutive rise after a year-on-year decline in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports rose 6.9 percent in the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, however, hit a four-month low in June, shrinking 2.3 percent compared with a 1.8 percent rise the month before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports," Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s trade surplus last month reached US$99 billion, up from US$82.6 billion in May. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Nasdaq fell 2.0 percent as investors moved away from artificial intelligence stocks. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761248_1_20240712043453.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both fell on Thursday, snapping a multiday run of records as investors shifted towards underbought equities and away from artificial intelligence names.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pivot came as the yield on US Treasury bonds fell further amid rising expectations of interest rate cuts after better US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.1 percent at 39,753.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.9 percent to 5,584, while the Nasdaq fell 2.0 percent to 18,283, snapping a run of seven straight records on the tech-focused index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While two of the three indices finished in negative territory due to weakness in Nvidia, Apple and other tech equities that have led the market in 2024, analysts noted that the majority of equities moved higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What's being bought is the laggards," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's the start of a healthy rotation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, overall consumer prices declined 0.1 percent on-month for the first time since 2020, US data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The better-than-expected reading comes as markets increasingly wager that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets now see around an 85 percent chance of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Delta fell 3.9 percent after reporting a 29 percent drop in quarterly profits to US$1.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier scored record revenues for the June quarter but said it would temper plans to add capacity in the second half of 2024 due to moderating demand. American Airlines and United Airlines also fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla plunged 7.9 percent following a report that Elon Musk's electric auto giant will delay a much anticipated "robotaxi" event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unveiling was originally planned for August 8, but Tesla has pushed the event back until October to give teams more time, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the decision. (AFP)

    EU accepts Apple plan to let rivals access tap-to-pay

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Competitors will now be able to compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops in the EU. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761239_1_20240712004748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU on Thursday approved Apple's offer to allow rivals access to the iPhone's ability to tap-to-pay within the bloc, ending a lengthy probe and sparing it a heavy fine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The case dates back to 2022 when Brussels first accused Apple of blocking rivals from its popular iPhone tap payment system in a breach of EU competition law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones. Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding," EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to "tap-as-you-go" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes must remain in force for 10 years and a "monitoring trustee" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple had risked a fine of up to 10 percent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet," the company said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro (US$1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe. (AFP)

    US consumer inflation eases more than expected

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden issued a statement saying the report shows the US is making significant progress in fighting inflation. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761230_1_20240711215505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US inflation cooled more than expected in June, government data showed on Thursday, a positive development for President Joe Biden as he fights to win confidence on his economic record in his reelection bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.0 percent last month from a year ago, said the Labour Department, as a drop in petrol prices more than offset housing costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A measure stripping out volatile food and energy prices also saw the smallest annual rise since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's report shows that we are making significant progress fighting inflation," Biden said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While costs of cars and appliances are falling, he conceded that prices remain too high and pledged to "do everything I can for the working people that built our economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A consensus forecast of analysts initially expected consumer inflation at 3.1 percent, down from 3.3 percent in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy has been on a bumpy path to reining in inflation, which soared to a blistering 9.1 percent in mid-2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This prompted the central bank to rapidly hike interest rates in hopes of easing demand and bringing down price increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that there has since been "modest" progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, overall CPI declined 0.1 percent on-month for the first time since 2020, Labour Department data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "core" CPI index excluding the volatile food and energy was up 3.3 percent on-year, the smallest jump since April 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The improvement on the inflation front recently is good news for growth in real disposable income, which matters for consumer spending," said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that spending "hit a lull" in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest report adds to a series of encouraging data that could give officials confidence that inflation is coming down to their two-percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This, in turn, would allow them to start cutting decades-high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jobs market, another segment that Fed policymakers are monitoring, has also returned to a "strong, but not overheated" state, Powell said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A further deceleration in prices and labour market cooldown would "support a change in message from the Fed" at its July policy meeting, said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This could open the door to rate cuts as soon as the September meeting, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, said: "We still have a ways to go yet."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While shelter inflation has noticeably eased, he maintained that housing has been a major factor behind the stickiness of figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't see relief in the housing market for some period of time after the Fed starts to cut rates," he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if the Fed starts cutting in September, it's going to be months and months before we see enough significant movement in the 30-year mortgage to make a difference," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered higher on Wednesday with major indices finishing up more than one percent, hitting fresh records amid rising expectations for upcoming interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at all-time highs following comments from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank would not wait until inflation hit two percent before considering a rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Treasury bond yields retreated, with analysts citing strong demand at a 10-year Treasury note auction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones gained 1.1 percent to 38,921.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.0 percent to 5,633 for its sixth straight record, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.2 percent to 18,647 to end at its seventh straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell's remarks came in congressional testimony before a House panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum," Powell said. "If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spartan Capital's Peter Cardillo said the rally was notable one day before the market sees key new US consumer price data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Powell is basically telegraphing to the market that we are having a rate cut in September," Cardillo said. "That's what's behind the move here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Microsoft advanced 1.5 percent as the tech giant informed regulators that it will not take a non-voting position on the board of OpenAI amid scrutiny of its influence over the groundbreaking ChatGPT maker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Honeywell International gained 1.9 percent after announcing that it purchased Air Products' liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business for US$1.8 billion. Air Products advanced 0.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advanced Micro Devices won 3.9 percent as it announced plans to acquire Silo AI, the largest private artificial intelligence lab in Europe, for about US$665 million. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank will not want to wait for inflation to cool to its two percent target before considering a rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum," Powell said in testimony to the US House Financial Services Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long," he added. In such a scenario, inflation would go well below the target level – which is also an undesirable outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell was responding to a question on whether the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, would need to dip below two percent at least once in the coming months before officials contemplate rate reductions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank leader's comments come a day after he noted recent inflation readings have shown "modest" progress, adding that "more good data" would boost confidence that price increases are cooling sustainably.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To combat surging inflation, the Fed in recent years hiked the benchmark lending rate to a decades-high level in hopes of easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, policymakers have held rates at a 23-year high. While inflation has peaked, its downward progress has stalled somewhat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Powell told lawmakers that he is not yet prepared to express confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the Fed's political independence, Powell added that this is critical to the central bank's ability to do its job and sustain the faith of people across the political spectrum. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it would launch a formal probe looking into EU practices during an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce will conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the relevant practices adopted by the EU in its investigation of Chinese enterprises," the ministry said in a note on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministry officials said they had decided to launch the probe following a complaint made by the national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint mainly dealt with "products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment", according to the ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation will last from July 10 to January 10, 2025, and could be extended to April 10, 2025 under special conditions, the ministry said. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index rose just over 90 points, or about 0.5 percent, at the opening on Wednesday to trade at around 17,613.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the US is "no longer an overheated economy," remarks that suggested the case for rate cuts is strengthening. Some investors had anticipated the Fed chair, in his testimony to a Senate banking panel, might do more than he did to telegraph that a cut was on track for the central bank's September meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index opened down 0.35 percent at 2,949. The Component Index in Shenzhen also opened lower, falling 0.39 percent to 8,672 points in early trading. (with additional reporting from Reuters and Xinhua)

 Consumer price inflation on the mainland slowed in June, while producer price deflation persisted, as Beijing's support measures set a bumpy economic recovery in motion for the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) in June rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, against a 0.3 percent rise in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CPI edged down 0.2 percent month-on-month, versus a 0.1 percent drop in May and worsening from an expected 0.1 percent fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) fell 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, narrowing from a 1.4 percent decline the previous month, and matching a forecast 0.8 percent fall. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq edged to fresh records on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell reported "modest" progress in countering inflation ahead of the publication of influential US pricing data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," Powell told a Senate panel in remarks that kept alive hopes for potential interest rate cuts later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,291.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent to 5,576, while the Nasdaq also advanced 0.1 percent to 18,429, ending at a record for the sixth straight day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have seen the spate of recent records as reflecting a combination of still solid labour market data with improving inflation trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some market watchers think equities could be poised for a pullback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So much good news is already discounted in the market that it would be easy for it to get a bit of news that's negative and then correct," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. "It's gone so far so fast."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides key inflation data, this week's calendar includes a spate of earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other large banks, kicking off the second-quarter reporting season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Boeing fell 1.4 percent after reporting it delivered 44 planes in June, its best month so far in 2024. However, overall commercial plane deliveries for the second quarter still dropped by nearly one-third to 92.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 3.7 percent, rising for the 10th straight session amid anticipation of the company's presentation on "Robotaxis" next month. (AFP)
