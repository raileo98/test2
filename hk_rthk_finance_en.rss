<div class="itemFullText">
 China will actively expand domestic demand and put consumption promotion at a more prominent position in the next step, Yuan Da, a senior official with the National Development and Reform Commission, told a press conference on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The state planner will launch efforts to boost consumption of major commodities such as automobiles and home appliances, and to improve and expand the quality and capacity of service consumption in education, elderly care, child care and domestic services, Yuan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support will be given to the high-quality development of cultural and sports tourism, Yuan said, adding that measures will be optimised to make travel in China more convenient and comfortable for foreign visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also expressed confidence that China will achieve its full-year economic growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is "sufficient" room for counter-cyclical policy adjustments, said Zhao Chenxin, vice head of the state planner. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday kept its base rate at 5.75 percent, after the US Federal Reserve ended a two-day meeting leaving its key rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the first interest rate cut could come as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said “inflation pressure in the US has somewhat abated lately, and the market expects that the easing cycle might begin soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it added that the pace of any easing remains uncertain, and said the interbank offered rate in Hong Kong might stay high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said in a statement.

 The Hang Seng Index fell 16.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to open at 17,327.85 points on Thursday, following its 2 percent rise on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates could be cut as soon as September if the US economy follows its expected path, putting the central bank near the end of a more than two-year battle against inflation. The Fed ended its latest two-day policy meeting with a decision to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the 5.25-5.50 percent range that was set a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it was keeping its base rate at 5.75 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could cut interest rates as soon as September, with technology shares leading the way.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Fed delivered what the markets anticipated in terms of opening the door to a rate cut in September without overcommitting," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major US indices spent almost the entire day in positive territory, hitting peaks during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference before edging down a bit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index led major indices, winning 2.6 percent to finish at 17,599.40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 percent to 40,842.79, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.6 percent to 5,522.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain interest rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Powell told a news conference that the first interest rate cut could come "as soon as" the Fed's next rate meeting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is beginning to feel more comfortable that inflation is beginning to come down," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Capital. "The Fed feels that it can finally get control of inflation, there is a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductor shares enjoyed a buoyant session, with artificial intelligence player Nvidia rocketing up 12.8 percent and Broadcom and Micron also advancing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing gained 2.1 percent despite reporting a bigger than expected loss as the troubled aviation company named Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO. The appointment won praise from analysts who said Ortberg's extensive aerospace experience would bolster a turnaround.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft fell 1.1 percent despite reporting a 10 percent jump in quarterly profit to US$22 billion. Analysts said a crucial cloud computing unit did not grow as strongly as expected. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Futures traders believe there's a 60 percent probability that the US Federal Reserve will make cuts of at least 0.75 percentage points this year. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764143_1_20240801024613.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve left its key lending rate unchanged again on Wednesday and said it had made "some further progress" in its inflation fight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the US central bank's benchmark interest rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement -- keeping rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a small uptick in inflation earlier this year, recent data suggest the Fed's mission of bringing inflation back down to its long-term target of 2 percent is now firmly back on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its favoured measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labour market has come into better balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective," the Fed said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks a slight change in tone from its decision in June, when it noted only that "modest further progress" had been made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance," the Fed said, adding that it was "attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But since then, the official figures have painted a better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 60 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cuts are expected to come in the form of three separate quarter-point moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favouritism towards the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November. (AFP)

    Boeing names new boss, unveils hefty loss

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing named former Rockwell Collins chief Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO on Wednesday, as the planemaker reported a loss on continued operational problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ortberg, 64, helped lead Rockwell Collins and integrate it into United Technology prior to his retirement from RTX in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment comes as Boeing attempts to rebound from a series of safety and quality control problems that have sharpened scrutiny on the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg "is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry," said Boeing chairman Steve Mollenkopf in a message to employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg is set to become CEO on August 8, taking over for Dave Calhoun, a former General Electric and private equity executive who has held the post since early 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with Kelly as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in our long history," Mollenkopf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing on Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss of US$1.4 billion, compared with a loss of US$149 million in the year-ago period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenues fell 14.6 percent to US$16.9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterly results reflected a continued drag from Boeing's commercial division, where it has lowered production while addressing safety and quality control issues under the close watch of regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has been in the hot seat since a January incident in which a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest results also showed significant weakness in its defence business due to a number of fixed price contracts where it has experienced deep losses due to supply chain problems, as well as higher engineering costs and technical issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's press release listed four defence contracts behind an operating loss of US$913 million in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations," Calhoun said. "We are making important progress in our recovery and will continue to build trust through action and transparency." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official advance estimates released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compares with a revised 2.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed the second quarter growth to an increase in exports and investment spending, saying it expects the economy to continue to expand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year, but performance of the different economic segments may vary amid uncertainties on various fronts," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions, escalating trade conflicts, and US interest rate trajectory remaining not entirely clear may add uncertainties to economic sentiment and activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Natixis Asia Pacific economist Gary Ng said the figure for the second quarter was slightly higher than he expected, but pressures still remain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the other components, such as the contraction in the household spending and also the greater growth in the import of services, which is basically reflecting the outbound tourism and also the rebound in investment, which basically just get back to the pre-Covid level and is still 16 percent lower than 2018 for the same period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think these are all the sorts of pressures that I would see within the economy that can actually drag the growth rate further in the future."

<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Holdings on Wednesday said its first-half pre-tax profit came in at US$21.6 billion, a 0.5 percent decline compared to the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it will pay an interim dividend of 10 US cents per share, the second payment this year following the 31 US cents announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC also announced a further three-month repurchase of up to US$3 billion, following the completed US$3 billion buyback announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With several major central banks seen likely to cut interest rates later this year, the group's outgoing chief executive, Noel Quinn, told an online press call that HSBC has reduced its sensitivity to interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates. And this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we knew that interest rate declines were going to come at some stage, we've been investing heavily in building up alternative revenue growth options, mainly around wealth, international wholesale banking and international transaction banking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incumbent chief financial officer, Georges Elhedery, will step into the chief executive role in September following Quinn's retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery highlighted the bank's commitment to its core Hong Kong and UK markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bulk of our capital and resources are deployed in our four scale activities, that is Hong Kong, the UK, our international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities, and our wealth proposition, and that's in particular in Asia," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm intending to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, intending to continue improving operating leverage, while maintaining a very strong discipline which is now embedded in the firm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has named Jonathan Bingham as the interim group chief financial officer, effective from September 2.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The tech-rich Nasdaq tumbled again while the Dow forged higher on Tuesday as investors continued to steer funds away from artificial intelligence equities toward other sectors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing so-called "rotation" from tech giants to smaller and medium-sized company comes as some of the biggest tech companies are set to report quarterly results in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, noted that this buying trend may be almost over now that Microsoft, Nvidia and others have fallen significantly from their peaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 percent to 40,743.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.5 percent to 5,436, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.3 percent to 17,147.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft reported after the market closed on Tuesday, while Apple, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta will report over the next two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This rotation likely stops when we get the majority of these mega caps to report," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Procter & Gamble dropped 4.9 percent as it reported a seven percent fall in quarterly profits on flat sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowdstrike also plunged nearly 10 percent following reports Delta hired attorney David Boies to seek damages following an IT outage that threw the airline's operations into turmoil for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the deluge of corporate earnings, this week's calendar includes Wednesday's Fed decision, as well as monthly US employment data on Friday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Monday following a choppy session to open a news-jammed week that includes major tech earnings and a Federal Reserve decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Investors are adopting a wait-and-see posture ahead of quarterly results from Microsoft, Apple and other tech giants, as well as a Wednesday Fed decision, analysts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but could hint at a rate cut at its next meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.1 percent at 40,539.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.1 percent at 5,463, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also won 0.1 percent at 17,370.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tech shares have been under pressure in recent weeks after leading the market for the first half of 2024, with investors shifting funds to other sectors due to concerns about excessive valuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, McDonald's gained 3.3 percent despite missing analyst estimates as the company vowed to redouble efforts to win over value-focused consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts noted the fast-food chain had fallen 17 percent prior to the results, suggesting the negative news was priced in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's agenda also includes a monthly US employment report for July. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's home prices have fallen to their lowest level in almost eight years, with analysts predicting a further slump in the property market due to high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Monday showed that private flat prices fell about 1.2 percent in June, pulling the official index down from 305.6 in May to 301.8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices also dropped for the second straight month, plunging to their lowest since September 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, senior director and head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said high interest rates and the inventory of unsold units will continue to affect the city's property market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still expect the prices to go down a little bit in the second half of the year. But the price drop will be narrowed, because people are expecting the US to cut the rates later this year, and it will increase the market confidence for some of the buyers... Across the whole year, the price drop will be about five percent," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents rose nearly 0.2 percent month-on-month in June to the highest level in four and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said he expects rents to continue to go up steadily, saying levels are being boosted by the arrival of overseas students and people moving to Hong Kong under talent admission schemes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks cheered a benign US inflation report on Friday, powering the market to a positive conclusion to the week despite weakness in tech shares in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report showed that the personal consumption expenditures price index eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in June, from 2.6 percent, amounting to progress in a key US Federal Reserve indicator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut interest rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones jumped 1.6 percent to 40,589.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 percent to 5,459, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.0 percent to 17,357.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Wednesday, led by a rout in tech shares, which have been seen as overvalued after strong gains in the first half of 2024. Despite the Nasdaq's bounce on Friday, the index finished the week down more than two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to have slowing inflation and solid growth," conditions "consistent with a soft landing thesis," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kourkafas expects more of a "rotation" away from technology to other sectors in the upcoming period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, 3M shot up around 23 percent after reporting better-than-expected earnings and lifting its full-year profit forecast. Analysts see the industrial heavyweight as well positioned following progress on major litigation issues that have dogged the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biogen dove 7.2 percent after announcing European officials gave a negative reading on a new Alzheimer's disease treatment. Biogen and partner Eisai said they would seek a reexamination of the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DexCom, which supplies glucose monitoring systems for diabetes, plunged more than 40 percent after lowering its sales forecast. (AFP)

    US stocks mixed after strong GDP figures

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Investors were surprised by the GDP numbers, which came in well above economists' estimates. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763186_1_20240726045730.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Thursday as traders contended with corporate earnings and economic data that came in far stronger than expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy surprised analysts by growing at an annualised rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter of the year – double the level seen between January and March, and well above economists' estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 0.2 percent at 39,935, while the S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to close at 5,399.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also finished the day in the red, declining by 0.9 percent to 17,181.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a strong economic report, so that helped boost investors' enthusiasm," Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin said. "But we also had some a mixed picture on the micro front."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had some disappointments out of Ford, American Airlines, so I think that it's creating perhaps a little tension in the market today," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, US auto giant Ford fell by 18.4 percent after missing earnings expectations, leading a sell-off in the sector that left General Motors and Stellantis down 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some cause for optimism as well on Thursday, with health care services provider Molina and digital workflow firm ServiceNow both finishing the day up, by 12.3 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors' attention is also firmly fixed on Friday's inflation data, which is sure to be closely scrutinised ahead of next week's Federal Reserve interest rate decision. (AFP)

    US rejects plan for G20 deal to tax super-rich

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Janet Yellen says all countries should make sure their taxation systems are fair and progressive. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763185_1_20240726021119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States sees no need to negotiate an international agreement on taxing the super-wealthy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, highlighting divisions on a plan that is top of the agenda at a G20 finance ministers' meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taxing the ultra-rich is a key priority of Brazil's leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who this year heads the G20 grouping of the world's major economies, the European Union and African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tax policy is very difficult to coordinate globally," Yellen told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro, ahead of an evening meeting between finance ministers to discuss the topic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see a need or really think it's desirable to try to negotiate a global agreement on that. We think that all countries should make sure that their taxation systems are fair and progressive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen said Washington was "strongly supportive of progressive taxation, and making sure that very wealthy, high-income individuals pay their fair share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She highlighted policies proposed by US President Joe Biden, such as a billionaires' tax, which she described as "a very worthwhile initiative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It makes sense for most countries to take this approach of progressive taxation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's search for a global agreement on taxing the richest of the rich is backed by France, Spain, South Africa, Colombia and the African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some individuals control more resources than entire countries," Lula said on Wednesday at the launch of an initiative to fight world hunger, another project topping his G20 agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His finance minister, Fernando Haddad, told local media on Wednesday that taxing billionaires would help finance the fight against hunger but "it will not be established overnight, because it is a very delicate mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global inequality has continued to widen in recent years, according to a study by the NGO Oxfam published on Thursday. The richest one percent of the world have earned more than US$40 trillion in a decade, but their taxation is at "historically" low rates, the study said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French economist Gabriel Zucman, a consultant with the G20 on taxation issues, estimates that the tax rate for billionaires represents 0.3 percent of their wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent report commissioned by the G20, he called for super-wealthy individuals to be taxed the equivalent of two percent of their fortune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington is not the only sceptic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the eve of the G20 meeting, Germany's finance ministry said it considers the idea of a minimum wealth tax to be "irrelevant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting of finance ministers in Rio opened with a session on the global economy, as inflation slows in many parts of the world after a surge fuelled by the war in Ukraine and other factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the ministers will tackle the financing of the climate transition and debt in their last meeting before a G20 summit on November 18 and 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Founded in 1999, the Group of 20 assembles 19 of the world's largest economic powers, as well as the European Union and the African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation was originally focused on global economic issues but has increasingly taken on other pressing challenges – even though member states do not always agree on what should be on the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's presidency said in a statement that some members of the G20 considered that crises such as the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza "have an impact on the global economy and should be addressed at the G20, while others believe that the G20 is not the place to discuss these issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisions within the G20, of which Russia is also a member, have made drafting a joint communique at the outcome of meetings a challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last meeting of finance ministers in Sao Paulo failed to issue such a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil hopes to publish three texts after the meeting, said Tatiana Rosito, a senior official at the country's economy ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aside from a joint final communique, this would include a document on "international cooperation in tax matters" and a separate communique from Brazil on geopolitical crises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is likely, based on my experience of previous G20s," that future ministerial-level meetings will publish separate statements in this manner, European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming for a single text "would not allow us to adopt anything," she said. (AFP)

    US economy beats growth expectations in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Commerce Department says the acceleration "primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending." Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763181_1_20240726012528.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US economic growth blew past expectations in the second quarter, boosted by consumer spending and inventory building despite high interest rates, US government data showed on Thursday, after a slow start to the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy grew 2.8 percent in the April to June period, up from 1.4 percent in the first three months this year, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial estimate was markedly above the 1.9 percent growth rate economists anticipated – a reassuring sign that consumption remains resilient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acceleration "primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending," said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was "partly offset by a downturn in residential fixed investment," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While sectors like manufacturing and housing have been struggling after the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked interest rates in 2022 to combat surging inflation, consumption has been stronger than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This gave the economy a boost despite rates hovering at their highest levels in more than two decades – making borrowing more expensive for individuals and companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key factor underpinning consumption has been the robust labour market, which saw continued wage growth and businesses reluctant to let go of workers after difficulties in hiring during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With inflation slowing and salaries still growing, economists said consumers' real disposable income gains became bigger, allowing them to keep dipping into their wallets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the economy outperforming predictions of possible recession, President Joe Biden has struggled to assuage concerns of many Americans feeling the pinch from higher costs of living.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his shock exit from the 2024 election, it remains to be seen if that negative sentiment will transfer to his likely Democratic replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see consumption continuing to be the engine of the economy, continuing to keep economic growth on a relatively strong growth path of around two percent," said economist Matthew Martin of Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that although unemployment has been edging up, the trend has more to do with entrances into the market rather than layoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This means it is not the start of a cycle where unemployment leads to income loss, in turn reducing spending and triggering more job losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there remain risks to the economy as unemployment tends to "shoot up" quickly, he said, noting that is not currently an expected outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's a big case to begin cutting rates in September and follow up with one every other meeting from there," he said of the US Federal Reserve's policymaking committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maintaining excessively restrictive monetary policy when the labour market appears to be fully back in balance could lead to an undesired weakening of employment growth and the economy," said EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a recent note. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Thursday cut a medium-term interest rate, marking the latest move by the authorities to boost economic growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's central bank cut the rate for its medium-term lending facility (MLF) – the interest for one-year loans to financial institutions – to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC issued 200 billion yuan in one-year loans under its MLF at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time the rate was cut was in August but the latest is the biggest since April 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marco Sun, chief financial market analyst at MUFG Bank (China), said Thursday's move could reduce the cost of financing and release cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unexpected MLF operation was also due to a large amount of MLF loans coming due, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the PBOC cut two benchmark lending rates, days after the Communist Party's third plenary session which outlined major reforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, major commercial banks announced reductions in deposit rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank was cut by 10 basis points to 1.35 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first deposit rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024. (Agencies)

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 50.22 points, or 0.29 percent, to open at 17,260.83 points on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Traders are taking a cautious stance ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures price index data, which is the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation and therefore plays a major role in its view on interest rates..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight in the US, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at multi-week lows, with the S&P snapping one of its longest streaks without a daily decline of more than 2 percent, as lacklustre Alphabet and Tesla earnings undermined investor confidence in large company names.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13. (with additional reporting by Xinhua and Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets tumbled on Wednesday following a bruising investor response to earnings from Tesla and Google parent Alphabet that added to worries about tech heavyweight equity valuations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downbeat reaction to results "feeds some angst about the mega cap stocks not being able to deliver stock performance," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, adding that even strong results next week from Apple, Amazon and other tech giants may not be received well by Wall Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a general bid to reduce exposure predicated on the idea that these stocks have run up a long way in a short time," O'Hare said.
  <br/>

  Tesla dropped 12.3 percent after missing earnings estimates as CEO Elon Musk touted progress on robotic and artificial intelligence technology. Analysts said the results added to worries about weakening profit margins amid ebbing demand for Tesla's electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Alphabet fell 5.0 percent after topping analyst estimates in general but reporting disappointing figures for its YouTube business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among economic reports, the sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Federal Reserve's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates, according to government data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New home sales in June came in at an annual, seasonally-adjusted, rate of 617,000, according to data released jointly by the US census and housing departments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was below the 621,000 rate in May, according to Wednesday's revised figures, and under the 640,000 projected by analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure refers to the number of homes sold over a whole year if sales continue at the rate seen in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median price in June was US$417,3000, up 2.5 percent from the prior reading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data follows a report that also showed a drop in sales of previously-owned homes that also missed analyst estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The June report on top of the weak May data show the "spring bounce in sales appears to have reversed," said a note from Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage rates currently stand below their four-week and 52-week average, according to Freddie Mac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, interest rates remain well above their levels for most of the last decade following a series of large Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to counter inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Fed's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New home sales are expected "to improve slightly" in the second half of the year, according to a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mortgage rates have fallen nearly 50 basis points to about 6.75 percent since early May and we expect rates to fall further as the Fed's rate cutting cycle gets underway," said the Oxford Economics note. (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index fell 14.93 points, or 0.09 percent, to open at 17,454.43 points on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank's monetary policy is back in focus ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data - the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the US, attention turned to corporate earnings, with Google parent Alphabet and electric carmaker Tesla both reporting results after Wall Street closed on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its earnings, Tesla reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits due to the effect of price cuts, while Alphabet beat revenue and profit expectations as its cloud and search ads businesses thrived. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished a choppy session slightly lower on Tuesday as investors assessed mixed earnings reports while monitoring the fast-changing US presidential contest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lockheed Martin, Spotify and Sherwin-Williams rallied, while General Motors and UPS both fell on a busy day of second-quarter corporate results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com said of the overall muted market reaction that there was "not a lot of conviction" after Monday's solid rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.1 percent at 40,358.09.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,555.71, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.1 percent to 17,997.35.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than two days after President Joe Biden pulled out of the November election, Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail in the battleground state of Wisconsin as she continued to lock up major endorsements from Democratic officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect the stock market to monitor the race more intensely closer to the November election date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, UPS sank more than 12.1 percent as it reported lower profits and revenues and cut some annual projections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM dropped 6.4 percent despite reporting profits that topped estimates. Analysts noted that the automaker had seen shares appreciate significantly heading into the report and also pointed to weakness in its China business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Spotify jumped 12 percent as it announced that it added seven million paid subscribers in the second quarter, beating forecasts after it raised prices. (AFP)

    North American sales help cushion GM from China woes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Strong North American sales helped offset weakness in China, with General Motors reporting US$2.9 billion in quarterly profit. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762879_1_20240724034127.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 General Motors reported higher profits on Tuesday behind another round of strong North American auto sales, with executives vowing a flexible approach to electric vehicle (EV) investment while demand growth ebbs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The major US automaker's second-quarter results demonstrated a continued lift from robust pricing in its home market, thanks to healthy demand for trucks that has made up for weakness in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM, like fellow Michigan automaker Ford, has slowed down its EV build-out, pushing back another project even as company officials emphasized a long-term commitment to the strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we go forward, we're going to bring additional capacity online in a measured cadence," said Chief Executive Mary Barra, pointing to third-party studies showing slower EV growth in the coming period compared with the last few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Profits came in at US$2.9 billion, up 14 percent from the year-ago period while revenues rose seven percent to US$48 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM increased some of its full-year projections based on the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North American auto sales rose compared with the year-ago period, with the company enjoying still-strong vehicle pricing that has lasted longer than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barra, in a letter to shareholders, pointed to "consistently high performing portfolio of ICE (internal combustion engine) trucks and SUVs on a volume, share and margin basis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM continued to struggle in China, where competition among car companies is high and the company suffered a second consecutive quarterly loss in equity income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competitors are "prioritizing production over profitability," said Barra, who plans to revamp a joint venture with Chinese company SAIC in hopes of a turnaround.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you get into the type of pricing where that's going on now, it's really a race to the bottom," Barra said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM noted that the company's Cruise autonomous vehicles service has returned to the road in three cities -- Phoenix, Dallas and Houston -- after a pause due to safety issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise is employing a driverless taxi model in these three cities, with a safety driver present to take over if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has not resumed service in California. Authorities halted testing of Cruise vehicles in the state in October 2023 following a series of accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM accounted for US$605 million in costs in the second quarter due to a production halt on the Cruise Origin, which had been planned as a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel. (AFP)

    Wall Street jumps as investors return to megacaps

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street finished higher in a strong session for big tech stocks. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762727_1_20240723050656.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's three benchmarks ended higher on Monday as investors returned to megacap growth stocks, helping both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recover from their worst weekly performance since April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also back in positive territory, breaking a two-session skid since hitting an all-time closing high last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacaps Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Tesla all advanced between 2.2 percent and 5.1 percent after being major drags on the market last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia also rose 4.8 percent% after Reuters reported the artificial intelligence chip leader was working on a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market that would be compliant with current US export controls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think this move today probably has more to do with a rebound from the selling that occurred last week than anything else," said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy & research at Glenmede.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief among the other factors on traders' minds was a re-examination of the state of the presidential race after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy for the November election on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's exit could prompt investors to unwind trades on bets that a victory for Republican Trump would increase US fiscal and inflationary pressures. But some analysts said markets could benefit from an increased chance of a divided government under the next administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump-linked stocks were mixed on Monday, with Trump Media & Technology Group dropping 0.8 percent, while software firm Phunware gained 4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having digested the news of Biden's withdrawal, investors will now be looking for answers to key questions including who will join Harris on the Democratic presidential ticket and to what degree, if any, the vice president will deviate from the platform which Biden was headlining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.08 percent, at 5,564 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.58 percent, to 18,008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent, to 40,415.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike slumped 13.5 percent, extending losses after a software update from the company sparked Friday's global tech outage. (Reuters)

    More rate cuts by PBOC to come: economists

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The PBOC lowered the one-year loan prime rate from 3.45 percent to 3.35 percent, and the five-year rate from 3.95 percent to 3.85 percent. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762664_1_20240722163203.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economists are anticipating more interest rate cuts by the mainland’s central bank this year, after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced the reduction of two benchmark rates on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The PBOC lowered the one-year loan prime rate from 3.45 percent to 3.35 percent, and the five-year rate from 3.95 percent to 3.85 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Greater China Economist at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking Michelle Lam said the rate cuts came earlier than expected, but she predicts the trims to have a limited impact on the mainland's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't think that a 10 basis point cut will be a game changer. And also right now, there's a lot of weak confidence among households. So probably it will not be very impactful in terms of boosting household consumption," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But still, it's better than not doing anything. So there will still be maybe somewhat marginally positive [impact] to support the domestic demand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate cuts came after the mainland saw slower-than-forecast economic growth of 4.7 percent in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hunter Chan, a Greater China Economist at Standard Chartered, said he believes the rate reductions will provide some support to the mainland's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cutting is to strengthen the countercyclical adjustment and to support the real economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we suggest the economy needs more supporting measures. And I guess the central bank also acted on that, to provide enough support to the real economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said he expects there will be at least one 10 basis point rate cut in the fourth quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC on Monday also lowered the interest rates on its standing lending facility, a type of loans that it lends to commercial banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The overnight, seven-day and one-month rates were cut by 10 basis points to 2.55 percent, 2.7 percent and 3.05 percent respectively.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people have been jailed for up to six years and eight months after being convicted in a high-profile market manipulation case, with a High Court judge saying the trio had damaged the city's status as a financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sit Yi-ki, Lam Wing-ki and Tam Cheuk-hang were found guilty of conspiracy to carry out false trading in the shares of Hong Kong-listed construction services company Ching Lee Holdings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence on Monday, deputy High Court judge Douglas Yau said it was a "meticulously planned and executed conspiracy" which threatened the integrity of the market, and therefore sentences serving as a deterrent were needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission, which brought the case, said the conspirators artificially increased the turnover of the shares by conducting manipulative trading activities among 156 securities accounts in 2016, while netting illicit profits of more than HK$124 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ploy began before Ching Lee's listing on March 29, 2016 and lasted for more than five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The manipulative activities inflated Ching Lee's share price by as much as 2,000 percent and it reached a historic high of HK$5.98 on July 13. It closed at HK$4.87 on September 6, before a collapse of 90 percent the following day to HK$0.45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission's executive director of enforcement, Christopher Wilson, said the sentences are the longest ever handed down by a court for a market manipulation offence under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It sends a very strong and clear message that we will not tolerate any continuous and further misdoings. This is also the first time that one of our cases has been heard before the High Court before a jury," he told reporters after the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined to root out all forms of market manipulation, to protect investors and uphold the integrity of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other people alleged to have been involved in the case are currently wanted by the authorities.

 The Hong Kong market opened higher on Monday amid an announcement by the mainland central bank to cut two key lending rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index gained 47 points or 0.27 percent at 17,465.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland stocks were mixed on Monday, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index down 0.14 percent to open at 2,978.19 points and the Shenzhen Component Index 0.06 percent higher at 8,908.21 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the People's Bank of China announced it was cutting two key rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.35 percent from 3.45 percent previously, while the five-year LPR was reduced by the same margin to 3.85 percent from 3.95 percent .

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell decisively for a second straight session on Friday following a major IT outage that roiled many businesses at a time when analysts consider the market "overbought."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Airlines, banks, TV stations and financial institutions were among those thrown into turmoil due to a faulty update to an antivirus programme for Windows systems from American cybersecurity group CrowdStrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outage added more uncertainty at a time when markets were already edgy over speculation that President Joe Biden will withdraw from the 2024 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 40,287.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.7 percent to 5,505, while the Nasdaq declined 0.8 percent to 17,726.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The market was extremely overbought so it was just a matter of time before we had a pullback," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far it has been relatively mild and I think earnings are going to be an important factor as to whether" the market keeps falling, Cahill said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Netflix fell 1.5 percent despite adding eight million new subscribers in the second quarter. But some analysts said the company's third-quarter revenue forecast was disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other companies reporting results, Travelers sank 7.7 percent, while American Express fell 2.7 percent and Schlumberger advanced 2.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company at the heart of the global outage, tumbled 11.1 percent. CEO George Kurtz announced that a fix had been rolled out for the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starbucks jumped 6.9 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that activist investor Elliott Investment Management had taken a stake in the coffee company. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday as most large tech shares continued a retreat while a closely watched risk index pushed higher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech shares have been under pressure in recent days amid talk that the market is "overbought" after a torrid run so far in 2024 on bullishness over artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "VIX" volatility index rose about 10 percent in a move that some market watchers tied to political pressure building on President Joe Biden to exit the 2024 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones dropped 1.3 percent to 40,665, retreating after three straight records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,544, while the Nasdaq declined 0.7 percent to 17,871.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses were broad-based, with energy the only one of 11 industrial sectors to advance in the S&P 500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, noted that Thursday's losses were broad-based and included smaller equities that had benefited in recent days from the tech selloff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't take much of an excuse for markets to take some profits when they've had such a good run," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding politics, Hogan said, "the market doesn't like uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spartan Capital's Peter Cardillo said speculation about Biden "could create some short-term election anxiety" after more investors expected a win by Donald Trump following their June presidential debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Central Bank meanwhile held borrowing costs steady, giving policymakers more time to assess progress on inflation after last month's first interest rate cut in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United Airlines shed 1.2 percent after reporting higher profits in the second quarter but cautioning that it would trim back capacity later in 2024 due to excess flights in the US market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DR Horton jumped 10 percent after reporting higher profits and revenues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited, and demographics supporting housing demand continue to be favourable," said David Auld, executive chairman of the homebuilder. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 TSMC on Thursday said it expects third-quarter revenue to surge by as much as 34 percent from a year earlier after the world's largest contract chipmaker posted a quarterly net profit that beat market expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier for US tech giants Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards the adoption of AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TSMC's April-June net profit climbed to T$247.8 billion (US$7.60 billion) from T$181.8 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The profit beat a T$238.8 billion forecast for the quarter which ended June 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said second-quarter revenue rose 33 percent year-on-year to US$20.8 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of between US$19.6 billion and US$20.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue for the current quarter is expected to be at least US$22.4 billion compared with US$17.3 billion in the same period last year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index dipped 86.18 points, or 0.49 percent, to open at 17,653.23 points on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sell-off came after the S&P 500 on Wednesday registered its biggest fall since April, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq saw its biggest fall since December 2022, losing 1.4 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors remain nervous about further US restrictions on Chinese technology and the prospects for chip production. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished decisively lower on Wednesday after talk that tech equities are overbought, while the Dow pushed to a third straight record high.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts described the development as an inevitable cooling in large tech names including Facebook parent Meta and artificial intelligence player Nvidia, after outsized gains in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow, however, continued to benefit from an inflow of funds to underperforming names from other sectors. The blue-chip index finished up 0.6 percent at 41,198.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent to 5,588, while the Nasdaq slumped 2.8 percent to 17,996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen a relentless rally and a pause might be healthy at this point," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, we had some concerns around semiconductors and chip makers which have been under pressure. And that's been kind of adding to the rotation narrative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Data showed that US industrial production cooled in June but still exceeded analyst expectations, with manufacturing and utilities output both rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Federal Reserve report said there has been "slight to modest" growth in economic activity in most parts of the country over recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A growing number of districts have, however, reported "flat or declining activity," said the Fed's "beige book" survey of economic conditions, which pointed to November's US presidential election and inflation as contributing to uncertainty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Johnson & Johnson rose 3.7 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits on a 4.3 percent increase in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drug and medical device company expressed confidence as it pursues regulatory approval of new products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JB Hunt Transport Services fell 6.9 percent after reporting lower profits on a seven-percent slide in revenues as the trucking and logistics company contends with tepid demand. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lands Department on Wednesday announced the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Hung Kai Properties beat 10 other bidders and won the tender for a site in Siu Lek Yuen, Sha Tin, for HK$619 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site is expected to generate around 280 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the only residential plot on offer in the April-June quarter under the government land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Victor Lui, said the company will build small and medium-sized units there, with a total investment of around HK$2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kathy Lee, head of research at Colliers, said the government's first successful sale of residential land after scrapping property-cooling measures in February sent a positive message to the market, amid concerns that developers were reluctant to bid for land.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC announced that Georges Elhedery will become the new group CEO. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761942_1_20240717132925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC on Wednesday named chief financial officer Georges Elhedery as the bank's next chief executive to drive "the next phase of development and growth".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to confirm Georges as the next HSBC Group Chief Executive," group chairman Mark Tucker said in a filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board concluded that Georges was the outstanding candidate and we look forward to working together as he leads HSBC through the next phase of development and growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery will take over on September 2 from current CEO Noel Quinn, who announced his retirement in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery joined HSBC in 2005 and previously held the role of Co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets before being appointed chief financial officer in January 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanon-born, French-educated banker also led the bank's Middle Eastern, North Africa and Turkey region from July 2016 to February 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before assuming the role of CFO in 2023, Elhedery had a six-month sabbatical that included spending time learning Mandarin, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery has a "track record of leading through change, driving growth, delivering simplification, containing costs and brings a strong focus on execution," Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery said he was "deeply honoured" by HSBC's trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working together with our talented team, I look forward to delivering exceptional value to our clients and investors by driving strong performance on a sustainable growth trajectory," he said in the filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC said it would announce the next chief financial officer in due course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn would work with Elhedery to ensure a "smooth and orderly" handover before stepping down, the bank added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn, 62, oversaw a transformation of the London-headquartered lender and saw record profits during almost five years in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under him, the bank accelerated a years-long pivot to Asia -- where it generates most of its revenue -- vowing to develop its wealth business and target fast-growing markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank concluded the sales of its Canadian operations and its retail bank operations in France. It will also sell its Argentina division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quinn last year led the effort to repel a bid by major shareholder Ping An to spin off its Asia assets, with the proposal eventually voted down by shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The break-up bid highlighted HSBC's precarious position amid US-China tensions, with some observers questioning whether Europe's largest lender can continue to straddle East and West. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to another record on Tuesday on bullish reaction to positive earnings reports amid optimism over the rising likelihood of US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The blue-chip index piled on 1.9 percent or more than 740 points to finish at 40,954.48, posting a second straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,667.20, also a record, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent to 18,509.34.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The records were driven partly by outsized gains for Bank of America and Dow member UnitedHealth Group following earnings reports, as well as an ongoing rotation of funds towards smaller companies that have underperformed in 2024 but are expected to be boosted by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides UnitedHealth, the Dow's biggest gainers included industrial giants Boeing and Caterpillar. (AFP)

    US retail sales flat in June as consumption cools

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the US Department of Commerce. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761856_1_20240716215636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States slipped less than analysts anticipated in June on a weaker performance in the auto and gas segments, government data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The slower consumption growth adds to recent data showing that the world's biggest economy is cooling gradually – a trend likely to raise the central bank's confidence that it can soon begin cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To ease demand and bring inflation back down sustainably, the Federal Reserve has rapidly lifted the benchmark lending rate and in recent months, held it at a decades-high level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in June, overall retail sales was US$704.3 billion, virtually unchanged from May's figure, according to the Department of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, May's increase was revised slightly higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, the rise in June was 2.3 percent, a cooldown from the prior month as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have long been expecting consumers to pull back as higher interest rates bite, lifting borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that consumption growth will, if anything, slow further in [the second half this year], as high interest rates continue to weigh on demand and the labour market takes a further turn for the worse," said Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among sectors, sales at auto dealers dropped 2.3 percent from May, while those at gas stations dropped three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But excluding auto and gas, total retail sales was up 0.8 percent in June – indicating that there may still be some way to go yet in easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales at restaurants and bars was up 0.3 percent from a month prior, the Commerce Department report showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed is set to make its next rate decision at the end of July, and analysts widely expect the central bank to begin lowering rates in September. (AFP)

    IMF maintains 2024 global growth forecast

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Washington-based IMF has cautioned that upside risks to inflation have increased. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761854_1_20240716214034.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The IMF held its global growth expectations for 2024 steady in a report on Tuesday even as it cut forecasts for the United States and Japan, while warning of inflation risks and trade tensions ahead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to grow 3.2 percent this year, unchanged from its April forecast, according to its World Economic Outlook update.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports from Asia, particularly in the technology sector," said the fund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For 2025, it expects global growth of 3.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even as many countries saw better growth than anticipated in the first three months this year, the IMF flagged what it called notable surprises in Japan and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington-based lender also cautioned that upside risks to inflation have increased, with services prices holding up disinflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated for longer, "in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An area of concern is trade and industrial policy, with countries potentially adopting measures that impact the global economy's integration, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if risk assessments have shifted after the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump, the Republican Party's nominee in November's election, Gourinchas noted the fund will consider its implications. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's economy grew 4.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, less than analysts had expected. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761623_1_20240715111349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy expanded at a slower-than-forecast 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, the government reported on Monday, while emphasising signs of improvement in factory output, income and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter growth was below the 5.3 percent seen in the first quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists said weak consumer demand and reduced government spending were dragging on growth in the world's No. 2 economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first six months of 2024, the economy expanded by five percent, in line with the country's growth forecast for the entire year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail sales slowed to two percent growth in June, official data showed, suggesting continued struggles to boost consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In June, the total retail sales of consumer goods went up by 2.0 percent year on year," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. May's figure was 3.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were up 3.7 percent year on year in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial output, meanwhile, climbed 5.3 percent year on year last month, and rose 6 percent for the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS attributed the weaker second-quarter GDP growth to short-term factors such as extreme weather and floods, but said it also reflected rising challenges, especially from insufficient effective demand and unsmooth economic flow at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, the national economy has continued to improve in the first half in a stable manner," the NBS said in a statement, citing support from policy incentives, rebound in external demand and development of new quality productive forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Yeung, a chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that weak retail sales dragged down GDP growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's also very consistent with our on-the-ground observations in different cities in China. Of course you don't notice that when Hong Kong people go to Shenzhen. But in other cities, which is clearly more domestic, the consumption level is clearly weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release of the latest economic figures came as leaders of the Communist Party gathered for a once-a-decade conclave to set economic policy that was expected to focus on self-sufficient strategies for growth in an era of tensions over trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-day meeting of the Communist Party’s 205-member Central Committee is the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, President and party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a work report on behalf of the Politburo at the start of the third plenum and expounded on a draft decision on further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such meetings typically focus on long-term issues, but business owners and investors are watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged downturn in the property market and boost the country's post-pandemic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the third plenary session has to focus on stabilising employment, noting reports of layoffs and salary cuts in the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately, what we need is to have a stable labour market and stable employment so that households will be more confident in spending. And that wage dynamic is the most important area the policymakers really need to focus on in the future," he said. (RTHK/Agencies)
