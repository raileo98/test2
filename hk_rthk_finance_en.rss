<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group rallied as much as 95 percent on Monday morning after the firm resumed trading following a share transfer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company, which is the EV unit of embattled property developer China Evergrande, on Sunday said 29 percent of its shares, or 3.14 billion, were expected to immediately change hands after liquidators reached a preliminary agreement with an unidentified buyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The deal, subject to due diligence, includes an option for the buyer to take an additional 29.5 percent of the shares, or about 3.2 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The market value of the total shares involved is about HK$2.41 billion, based on the HK$0.38 per share before the trading suspension on May 17.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agreement, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Sunday, also includes a possible credit line to be arranged by the buyer to finance the company’s ongoing operations and the development of its electric vehicle businesses.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shares of the EV unit rallied to HK$0.74 per share shortly after its trading resumption.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EV maker is faced with a severe shortage of capital, with its Tianjin factory having ceased production at the beginning of the year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It has been struggling since its parent firm got sucked into a property crisis in China in 2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trading in the shares of Evergrande remains suspended.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Profits of China's major industrial firms increased 4.3 percent year on year in the first four months of the year, official data showed on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The growth rate was the same with that registered in the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For April alone, profits were up 4 percent, versus a 3.5 percent slide in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Industrial firms with an annual main business revenue of at least 20 million yuan saw their combined profits reach 2.09 trillion yuan during the January-April period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The pickup in earnings followed export-led growth in factory output over the past month while retail sales unexpectedly slowed, underscoring uneven recovery.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Domestic effective demand remains insufficient while the external environment is still complicated and severe," said NBS statistician Wei Ning in a separate statement, noting that the foundation for improvement in industrial profits needs to be consolidated. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained lost ground on Friday to trade higher ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend, with renewed enthusiasm for generative AI-linked companies pushing Nvidia's share price.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished the day up 1.1 percent to 16,920, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,304.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones stabilised after tumbling on Thursday to close almost unchanged at 39,069.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While stocks often rise ahead of the Memorial day weekend, Friday's buoyant trading day also had Nvidia's recent streak to thank, said Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company, which sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in many generative AI products, saw its share price rise 2.6 percent on Friday, leaving it up more than 15 percent this week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We know that expectations were very high, and yet they seem to meet or exceed them on more than one level," he said. "So whether we like it or not, artificial intelligence now is an important factor when it comes to the stock market sentiment."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "And to the extent that Nvidia's numbers were able to meet or beat expectations that's supportive for the market," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Other tech companies that saw their share price jump on Friday include Advanced Micro Devices, which closed up 3.7 percent, and Intel, which finished 2.1 percent higher. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished sharply lower on Thursday after blowout earnings by Nvidia failed to ignite a broad rally.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Stocks had opened higher, but analysts cited an uptick in US Treasury bond yields as a driver of the reversal. Market watchers also noted a tendency in equities to sell off after big rallies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "You've had huge runs since mid-April and there's an inclination to take some money off the table," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones finished down 1.5 percent at 39,065.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 slid 0.7 percent to 5,267, while the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent to 16,736.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, artificial intelligence player Nvidia surged 9.3 percent after reporting a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Live Nation Entertainment dropped 7.8 percent after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit, arguing the company, which owns ticketing behemoth Ticketmaster, should be broken up.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Boeing plunged 7.6 percent after the company's CFO predicted another quarter of meagre plane deliveries, likely resulting in negative cash for all of 2024.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Retail company VF, which owns Timberland and other outdoor apparel brands, fell 2.9 percent after reporting a US$418.3 million loss in the most recent quarter. The company said a turnround is on track. (AFP)

    US sues to dismantle Ticketmaster-owner Live Nation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754458_1_20240524041833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Justice filed a major antitrust lawsuit on Thursday seeking to break up the alleged monopoly held by Live Nation Entertainment and its Ticketmaster subsidiary in the live music industry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York, alleges that Live Nation has abused its dominant market position to raise ticket fees, squeeze out competitors and limit choices for fans, venues and artists.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators," said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is time to break up Live Nation."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ticketmaster's pricing practices for concerts and sports events, with high fees and lack of alternatives, have long been a political issue in the United States, with little done historically to open up the market to more competition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Widespread outages and exorbitant fees caused an uproar, with lawmakers in Washington holding hearings to question Live Nation-Ticketmaster executives over the debacle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The move by US officials against Live Nation also came as the Biden administration, according to polls, is seen by voters as failing to do enough to curb inflation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 High prices have become a key issue in battleground states ahead of the 2024 election that pits Biden against former president Donald Trump.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a statement, Live Nation said the lawsuit "won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Calling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment," it added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Live Nation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, has grown into a US$22 billion global giant that produces over 30,000 concerts annually for nearly 500 touring artists across its network of over 265 venues in North America.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company has fought back against allegations it harms the ticketing industry, saying it brought innovation and lower prices because of its national reach.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the DOJ counters that US fans still pay higher fees with "outdated technology" compared to other countries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The lawsuit detailed allegations of unlawful tactics by Live Nation to maintain its dominance, including "threatening and retaliating against venues" by signalling they could lose concerts and revenue if they work with rivals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 68-page suit paints Live Nation-Ticketmaster as operating a "self-reinforcing business model" that allows it to capture revenue from ticket sales and then use that revenue to lock up artists to exclusive promotion deals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It then leverages its access to top performers to sign venues into long-term exclusive ticketing deals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fights against Ticketmaster's power go back to the 1990s, when the rock band Pearl Jam refused to perform at Ticketmaster venues in protest at its service charges that increased ticket prices.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ticketmaster was accused of organising a boycott of Pearl Jam's tour, and the band eventually gave up its campaign against the ticketing giant. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The AI boom has been a huge boost to Nvidia which saw profits and revenues rise considerably. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754360_1_20240523130214.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Nvidia easily beat Wall Street estimates as its profits and revenues skyrocketed, boosted by its chipmaking dominance which has made the company an icon of the artificial intelligence boom.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its net income rose more than sevenfold compared to a year earlier, jumping to US$14.88 billion in its first quarter that ended April 28 from US$2.04 billion a year earlier.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Revenue more than tripled, rising to US$26.04 billion from US$7.19 billion in the previous year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The next industrial revolution has begun,” CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centre he called “AI factories” designed to produce “a new commodity — artificial intelligence.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Huang added that training AI models was becoming a faster process as they learn to become “multimodal” — that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data — and also “to reason and plan.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company reported earnings per share — adjusted to exclude one-time items — of US$6.12, well above the US$5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shares in Nvidia Corp rose 6 percent in after-hours trading to US$1,006.89.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company’s stock has risen more than 200 percent in the past year. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday following mixed earnings reports as Federal Reserve meeting minutes highlighted inflation worries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Equities spent much of the day essentially flat, but tripped into the red after the Fed minutes showed that policy makers were frustrated with the lack of progress in bringing inflation towards the central bank's two percent target.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said the concerns were unsurprising given the mindset of the Fed at the May 1 meeting, but that the release served as an excuse for investors to sell after a big rally since the meeting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones finished down 0.5 percent at 39,671.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 shed 0.3 percent to 5,307, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,801, pulling back after two straight records.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Target slumped 8.0 percent after reporting a drop of 3.7 percent in comparable sales in the first quarter. The big-box retailer characterised the results as being in line with expectations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lululemon Athletica dropped 7.2 percent after announcing a number of executive reassignments following the departure of Chief Product Officer Sun Choe, who is leaving for another career opportunity.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Moderna surged 13.7 percent after announcing that it had been cleared to present abstracts at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, which begins on May 31 in Chicago. (AFP)

    US home sales slip on still high mortgage rates

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mortgage rates have surged in recent years as the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked the benchmark lending rate to tackle stubborn inflation. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754289_1_20240522235710.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Existing home sales in the United States crept lower in April as mortgage rates remained elevated, industry data showed on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sales of previously owned homes dipped by 1.9 percent from March, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million, said the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Analysts had expected a slight uptick last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Home sales changed little overall, but the upper-end market is experiencing a sizeable gain due to more supply coming onto the market," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Total housing inventory at the end of April was up nine percent from March, and was 16.3 percent higher than the same period a year ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mortgage rates have surged in recent years as the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked the benchmark lending rate to tackle stubborn inflation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For now, the central bank continues to hold rates steady as it seeks to stamp out price increases.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As of May 16, the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02 percent, up from 6.39 percent a year prior, according to home loan finance firm Freddie Mac.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In mid-May 2021, the rate was around three percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Higher rates have weighed on transactions, as homeowners who locked in lower rates previously remained reluctant to enter the market.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From a year ago, home sales were also 1.9 percent lower in April, NAR data showed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The median sales price in April rose 5.7 percent from a year ago to US$407,600 – the highest since June 2023.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Looking ahead, however, "the pace of price increases should taper off since more housing inventory is becoming available," Yun said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mortgage demand is expected to remain tepid in the near term, given that long-term rates are still elevated, analysts from Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a recent note.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We expect a decline in long-term rates over the next couple of months, but we also expect the labour market will start to look much weaker, slowing the growth in the pool of potential homebuyers," Pantheon added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq climbed to a fresh record on Tuesday following a choppy session after a smattering of mixed earnings and muted Federal Reserve commentary.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There really isn't much economic news to speak of," said Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin, who pointed to Wednesday's earnings report from Nvidia as one of the highlights of the week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shares of Nvidia rose 0.6 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tech-rich Nasdaq finished at 16,832, up 0.2 percent for the day and a record for the second straight session.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones also advanced 0.2 percent to 19,872, along with the S&P 500, which stood at 5,321.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cresset's Ablin said the stock market is probably "overbought" at this point, adding that, "relative to bonds, the stock market is probably the most expensive it's been since the financial crisis."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All three major indices scored records last week following data showing a moderation in inflation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Lowe's dropped 1.9 percent after earnings topped analyst expectations. However, revenues for the home-improvement retailer fell about four percent to US$21.4 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump Media & Technology Group slumped 8.7 percent after reporting a net loss of US$327.6 million in the quarter ending March 31.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Disney nudged up 0.1 percent following news the company's animation studio Pixar is laying off about 14 percent of its staff. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks dipped early on Tuesday, edging back from recent records following muted Federal Reserve commentary and mixed earnings.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gains by several large tech companies pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record on Monday, on an overall mixed day for US equities as weakness at JPMorgan Chase dragged down the Dow.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Microsoft climbed 1.2 percent as it unveiled new PC offerings that feature generative artificial intelligence tools built directly into its Windows operating system.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chip giant Nvidia also advanced ahead of its earnings release due later this week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But JPMorgan slumped 4.5 percent, with analysts attributing the decline to CEO Jamie Dimon signalling he is closer to retiring from the US banking giant.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 0.7 percent to 16,794, topping last week's record.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones, meanwhile, slid 0.5 percent to 39,806, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,308.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Besides Nvidia earnings, this week's calendar includes Federal Reserve minutes from the May 1 meeting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's a mixed session," said Peter Cardillo, of Spartan Capital. "I kind of think it's going to be this way until some new catalyst."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Results from some leading retailers, including Target and Lowe's, are also on this week's plate. Strong results from Walmart last week added to market momentum.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among other equities, tech company Jabil shot up 5.2 percent after announcing that Michael Dastoor was promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive officer. The company also confirmed its profit forecast. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow Jones finished above 40,000 points for the first time on Friday, as stocks were mixed on Wall Street at the end of the trading week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to finish at 40,003.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 percent at 5,303, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 16,685.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But despite the slight decline in the Nasdaq, all three major indexes still finished the week higher than they were at the start of it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We made a breakout to new record high," said Karl Haeling from LBBW.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The market is just choosing to consolidate, which is probably a healthy thing," he continued. "Because it's racing and getting too exuberant."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, petrochemical producer Valero Energy finished the day up 4.8 percent, while the mining company Freeport McMoRan was up 4.2 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the day's big losers was Paramount Global, which saw its share price fall 4.9 percent. (AFP)

    E-CNY pilot scheme expanded to HK for the first time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition seeking liquidation of Country Garden. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753541_1_20240517125904.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong stocks opened with more gains on Friday morning as investors brushed off losses on Wall Street and focused on possible US interest rate cuts and strong earnings for tech giants.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reddit has partnered with OpenAI to bring its content to popular chatbot ChatGPT, the companies said on Thursday, sending the social media platform's shares up 12 percent in extended trade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The deal underscores Reddit's attempt to diversify beyond its advertising business, and follows its recent partnership with Alphabet to make its content available for training Google's AI models.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 ChatGPT and other OpenAI products will use Reddit's application programming interface, the means by which Reddit distributes its content, following the new partnership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 OpenAI will also become a Reddit advertising partner, the company said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ahead of Reddit's March IPO, Reuters reported that Reddit struck its deal with Alphabet, worth about US$60 million per year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Investors view selling its data to train AI models as a key source of revenue beyond Reddit's advertising business.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The social media company earlier this month reported strong revenue growth and improving profitability in the first earnings since its market debut, indicating that its Google deal and its push to grow its ads business were paying off.

 Reddit's shares rose 10.5 percent to US$62.31 after the bell. As of Wednesday's close, the stock is up nearly 12 percent since its market debut in March. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished modestly lower on Thursday, retreating from a record run that included the Dow's first ever rise above 40,000 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow lingered above that level for hours before ending slightly lower.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We had a big move yesterday in response to data that were friendly for the Fed," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Today there was this absence of any major catalyst," he said. "With stocks at all-time highs, I think taking a breather is healthy."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,869.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 5,297, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 percent to 16,698.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All three indices finished at records on Wednesday following data showing a cooling in US inflation that raised hopes of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Walmart shot up 7.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as the retail giant pointed to gains from wealthier consumers.
 <br/>

 But Deere & Company dropped 4.7 percent as it projected broad-based 2024 sales declines in light of a tough operating environment in the farming economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday after data showed a moderation in US consumer prices in April, boosting the chances for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All three major indices rocketed to fresh all-time highs after monthly US consumer prices came in slightly below expectations, with annual inflation at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage points from March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones gained 0.9 percent to 39,908, putting it back within striking distance of a first-ever close above 40,000 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 jumped 1.2 percent to 5,308, while the Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent to 16,742, notching a second straight record.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Retail sales were flat in April, missing estimates for a 0.4 percent increase.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The reports together "point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US stocks rallied in the first quarter on expectations for interest rate cuts, but hit obstacles later in the spring as Fed officials pushed back the timeframe for easing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Dell surged 11.2 percent after Morgan Stanley analysts lifted their price target on the technology company, highlighting its artificial intelligence offerings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Boeing slumped 2.1 percent after the Department of Justice said the company had breached a 2021 criminal settlement, potentially leading to criminal prosecution.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 GameStop and AMC Entertainment tumbled following two days of gains that prompted talk of a revived "meme stock" craze. GameStop dropped 18.9 percent, while AMC lost 20 percent. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US consumer inflation eased slightly last month, according to US government data published on Wednesday, a positive sign for President Joe Biden ahead of November's election.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The data supports the Biden administration's messaging that the US economy has turned a corner, as it looks to quell consumers' concerns about the impact of rising prices going into the likely rematch against former president Donald Trump.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage point from March, the US Labour Department said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Monthly inflation came in at 0.3 percent, slightly below expectations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CPI data also helps the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates to their highest level for 23 years in a bid to bring inflation back down firmly to its long-term target of two percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It marks the first month of slowing annual data since January, although both the annual and monthly figures remain too high.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline," the Labour Department said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Combined, these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items," it added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A widely-watched inflation measure excluding volatile food and energy prices also eased last month, rising at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, down from 3.8 percent in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The so-called "core" inflation index rose 0.3 percent in April from a month earlier, according to the Labour Department, also slightly lower than in March. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq finished at a new record on Tuesday as US stocks rallied, shrugging off data that showed April wholesale inflation that topped expectations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tech-focused index closed at 16,511, up 0.8 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to 39,558, while the S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 5,246.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US wholesale prices jumped by 0.5 percent in April, much above estimates in a dynamic that could keep Federal Reserve interest rates higher for longer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, analysts noted that the gain was offset by a revision to the March report, which showed wholesale inflation cooling in that period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The numbers were more or less in line," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, who pointed to Wednesday's consumer price report as a key test for stocks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the first quarter as "notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," adding that "we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet rose 0.6 percent as the tech giant highlighted its artificial intelligence offerings at a developer conference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Home Depot dipped 0.1 percent after reporting a decline in first-quarter revenues as it pointed to "continued softness" in some consumer segments. The home-improvement retailer confirmed its full-year forecast.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 GameStop jumped 60.1 percent and AMC Entertainment 32 percent in a revival of the so-called "meme stock" craze from 2021. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that hot US inflation data has lowered his level of confidence that price rises will slow back down towards the bank's long-term target.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The first quarter in the United States was notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," the head of the US central bank said during an event in the Netherlands that was streamed online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected," he continued. "And so what that has told us is we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed has held interest rates at a 23-year high as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making progress for much of last year, the rate at which consumer prices have been rising has accelerated since the start of 2024, pushing back expectations of interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell said that, while he still expected inflation to move back down towards the levels seen last year, "my confidence in that is not as high as it was having seen these readings in these first three months of the year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the recent uptick in inflation, Powell said he did not think it was necessary to raise rates from their current "restrictive" levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is," he added. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A revival in GameStop and other meme stocks overshadowed a mixed performance in the broader stock market on Monday as a Dow winning streak ended.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Art Hogan, from B. Riley Financial, said the markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's consumer price index report for April.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The market will celebrate signs of moderating inflation, Hogan said, while further signs of intensifying inflation will lead to "the kind of selling pressure that we saw in April."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 percent to 39,431, ending an eight-day winning streak.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 was flat at 5,221, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 percent to 16,388.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Monday's light schedule in terms of economic reports continued the sleepy tenor of last week, when stocks climbed on hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The inflation report -- along with this week's retail sales data -- will inform expectations about US monetary policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, GameStop rocketed 70.9 percent higher while AMC Entertainment surged 80.9 percent. Both benefited from the return to social media of "Roaring Kitty," whose posts helped ignite a massive rally in a handful of stocks in January 2021.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Apple jumped 1.8 percent following a Bloomberg report that the smartphone giant is close to a deal with OpenAI to add ChatGPT to iPhones. (AFP)

    Anglo American rebuffs BHP's revised offer

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian mining giant BHP announced on Monday that British rival Anglo American has rejected an "improved" takeover bid worth £34 billion (almost HK$333.5 billion).
 <br>
  <br/>
  BHP's latest offer, which aims to create the world's biggest-listed copper producer, comes after its initial £31.1-billion approach had already been rebuffed last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The revised proposal was rejected by the Anglo American board on 13 May 2024. BHP is disappointed that the... board has chosen not to engage with BHP with respect to the revised proposal and the improved terms," the company said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new bid was pitched at £27.53 per share, up from £25.08 per share that had been slammed by Anglo as "highly unattractive" and "opportunistic" in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP has lifted the number of shares that would be given to Anglo investors under the improved terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it still plans to split off Anglo's platinum and iron ore subsidiaries in South Africa, with shares split between the British firm's shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP put forward a revised proposal to the Anglo American Board that we strongly believe would be a win-win for BHP and Anglo American shareholders," said BHP chief executive Mike Henry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are disappointed that this second proposal has been rejected," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest offer would increase Anglo's share of the new combined group to 16.6 percent, up from 14.8 percent previously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP and Anglo American are a strategic fit and the combination is a unique and compelling opportunity to unlock significant synergies by bringing together two highly complementary, world class businesses," added Henry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The combined business would have a leading portfolio of high-quality assets in copper, potash, iron ore and metallurgical coal and BHP would bring its track record of operational excellence to maximise returns from these high-quality assets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-afternoon deals on the London stock market, Anglo American's share price slid 0.8 percent to £27.51, while BHP dipped 0.6 percent to £22.83. (AFP)

    Retail workers at Apple store okay strike action

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Employees at an Apple store in the United States have given the go-ahead for the first strike action against the retailer in the United States. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752877_1_20240513010852.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionized workers at a Maryland Apple store voted on Saturday to authorize a strike, which would mark the first such labour action against the retailer in the United States if it goes forward.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Employees at the Apple store in the town of Towson, near Baltimore, voted to unionise in 2022 -- another first for the iPhone maker's US stores.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But a contract has yet to be agreed upon.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Following over a year of negotiations with Apple management that yielded unsatisfactory outcomes," union members are "signaling their collective demand for meaningful change," a union statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The issues at the forefront of this action include concerns over work-life balance, unpredictable scheduling practices disrupting personal lives, and wages failing to align with the area's cost of living."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Towson store has about 100 employees. A majority of them were required to vote for the result to be valid.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The next negotiation meeting is scheduled for May 21, though a strike could come before that.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, employees at another of the California-based company's stores, in New Jersey, voted down a unionisation effort over the weekend.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a statement to CNN, Apple said it would "engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The National Labor Relations Board, the federal labour regulator, has received numerous complaints against Apple, accusing it of trying to discourage staff from unionising.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US tech companies in general are seen as hostile toward unionisation efforts -- particularly Amazon.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In September, nearly a quarter of Apple store employees in France went on strike the day the iPhone 15 launched, demanding a pay raise at least equal to inflation. (AFP)

    Wall Street makes gains ahead of inflation data

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street closed higher for the week after a slow Friday. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752698_1_20240511044929.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks eked out modest gains on Friday and all three indexes posted another weekly advance as investors parsed comments from Federal Reserve officials and looked ahead to crucial inflation figures next week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 and the Dow were modestly higher and the Nasdaq ended essentially unchanged. All three indexes were up for the week with the blue-chip Dow nabbing its largest Friday-to-Friday percentage advance since mid-December.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Commentary from several Fed officials helped set expectations as market participants looked toward next week's inflation data.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Nobody really wants to take a big position prior to next week," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. "And we’re getting into a time of year where people seem to slip out early on Fridays."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The biggest story is the decline in Consumer Sentiment, but outside of that there isn't much to hang your hat on," Carlson added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic acknowledged recent clues the economy is slowing, but added the timing of rate cuts remains uncertain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Striking a more hawkish tone, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said it was unclear whether monetary policy was tight enough to bring inflation down to the central bank's 2 percent target.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hints of progress toward that target will come next week when the Labour Department releases its Consumer and Producer price indexes (CPI and PPI).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Analysts expect the crucial CPI report to show underlying "core" price of 3.6 percent year-on-year, which would be the coolest reading in over three years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Fed is geared not to raise rates but cut them, so 'higher for longer' is about as dire as it's going to unless things really fall off the table," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor & market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest in Elmhurst, Illinois.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent, to 39,513, the S&P 500 gained 0.16 percent, to 5,223 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.03 percent, to 16,341.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nvidia gained 1.3 percent after TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker and a major supplier to Nvidia, reported a near 60 percent jump in April sales.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Novavax shares surged 98.7 percent in the wake of the vaccine maker's licensing deal worth up to US$1.2 billion with Sanofi. SoundHound AI jumped 7.2 percent after beating first-quarter revenue estimates. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks climbed on Thursday as economic data raised hopes that the US central bank is on track for interest rate cuts later this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones rose 0.9 percent to 39,387, while the S&P 500 jumped 0.5 percent to 5,214.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Nasdaq added 0.3 percent to 16,346.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The gains came after initial jobless claims rose to the highest level since last August, to 231,000 for the week ending May 4.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A higher level of claims – if the trend persists – could be seen as a sign of the labour market cooling down, giving the Federal Reserve impetus to lower interest rates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the higher unemployment claims has helped bond markets. US Treasury bond yields, a proxy for interest rates, moved lower.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While rate cuts will depend on subsequent inflation data, he added: "We are seeing some cracks in the labour market and when that happens, that eventually leads to slow economic activity."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among companies reporting results, Warner Bros. Discovery closed 3.1 percent up while Arm Holdings slumped by 2.3 percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Airbnb shares slid by 6.9 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved sideways on Thursday following mixed earnings reports as weekly US jobless claims pushed higher.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The jump in initial jobless claims by 22,000 to 231,000 puts the benchmark at the highest level since last August, according to Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The data "will be construed as a sign of softening in the labour market," O'Hare said. "That view, in turn, will be construed as a possible trigger for a Fed rate cut in coming months."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The data came as the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones was up 0.1 percent at 39,098.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,186, while the Nasdaq declined 0.3 percent to 16,262.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among companies reporting results, Warner Brothers Discovery advanced 2.0 percent, Arm Holdings dropped 6.3 percent and Airbnb fell 7.2 percent. (AFP)

    Stock market rebound helps more IPO listings: HKEX

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Figures from the General Administration of Customs show that exports grew 1.5 percent from April last year, in line with analysts' expectations, after contracting sharply to 7.5 percent in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Imports in April surged 8.4 percent – nearly double market estimates – after falling by 1.9 percent in the previous month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, imports from the United States jumped by nine percent, while exports fell by nearly three percent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China's trade surplus rose to US$72.35 billion from US$58.55 billion in March. (Agencies)

    Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's best friend: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The friendship between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia has blossomed since SAR officials visited the Middle Eastern country two years ago, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the Capital Markets Forum, co-organised by the Hong Kong and Saudi bourses, Wong said the two territories are discussing an investment promotion and protection deal and a number of organisations have signed memoranda of understanding on issues ranging from dispute avoidance and resolution to artificial intelligence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also pointed out that the SAR provides a fundraising platform for Saudi Arabian businesses to expand, serves as a springboard to access the mainland Chinese market, and offers opportunities to allocate offshore renminbi assets.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wong stressed that the SAR and Saudi Arabia can help each other achieve their "ambitious goals in finance and well beyond".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Saudi Arabia has clear and ambitious goals for the development of its financial markets, and it's cultivating a diversified and efficient financial sector that contributes to realising the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong, meanwhile, is an international financial centre, with a highly open and internationalised market and a regulatory regime that is aligned with major overseas markets. We adopt the best practices in the world... With our advanced capital markets, Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's partner and best friend."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also revealed that the SAR administration is considering setting up an economic and trade office in Saudi Arabia, and that Cathay Pacific will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh in the fourth quarter of this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The new CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Bonnie Chan, told the same event that the SAR and Saudi Arabia have been working closely together.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The HKEX has been playing its role by building more connectivity between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's capital markets," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have signed a [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Tadawul Group. We have added the Saudi exchange as one of our recognised stock exchanges. We listed the world's largest and Asia's first Saudi ETF on our markets, an important first step in enabling Hong Kong investors to get to know to the Saudi market."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Deputy Minister of Investment Development in Saudi Arabia, Saleh Al-Khabti, said Hong Kong could be more involved in the kingdom's development, as Riyadh aims to invest US$3.2 trillion into its economy by 2030.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "One thing that's very important is I believe we don't see enough participation from the Hong Kong financial sector and the role it can play to facilitate for China and the rest of Asia, becoming part of that beautiful story we have," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved in opposite directions on Wednesday, digesting another round of mixed earnings in a quarter that has seen solid but unspectacular corporate results.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think that companies did a nice job of outpacing their Q1 expectations. But I did notice that earnings estimates for the year for 2024 really haven't changed much," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that companies aren't reporting "much earnings growth."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dow Jones finished up 0.4 percent at 39,056.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The S&P 500 was flat at 5,187, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,302.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Stocks finished little changed on Tuesday after three up days in which markets embraced Federal Reserve comments that further interest rate hikes were unlikely.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A handful of prominent earnings reports have commanded focus in a week with few major economic reports following last week's heavy calendar that included April jobs data and a Federal Reserve decision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among individual companies, Uber dropped 5.7 percent after reporting a US$654 million loss, while rival ride-hailing company Lyft jumped 7.1 percent after topping estimates, saying it sees solid demand growth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Also higher was Reddit, which advanced 3.9 percent as it posted a 48 percent jump in revenues to US$243 million. The social media company said higher costs were driven by expenses for its initial public offering. (AFP)

    FTX says customers will be repaid for losses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customers of failed cryptocurrency platform FTX will be made whole on the assets they lost when the company collapsed in 2022, it announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plan "contemplates the centralised distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022," said a statement released by FTX Trading LTD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total distributions to customers will be between US$14.5-US$16.3 billion. FTX said the plan still must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 percent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors," said John Ray III, chief executive and chief restructurings officer of FTX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX said it garnered the funds "by monetising an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets," mostly investments held by the company and affiliates and litigation claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another factor was the resolution of claims against the firm, including some US$24 billion that had been sought by the Internal Revenue Service for the period prior to the Chapter 11 filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To resolve the IRS cases, FTX will instead pay US$200 million in cash and US$685 million to be paid out after other claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan also will pay out interest of up to nine percent, FTX said. What won't be included will be the appreciation in value that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed since November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX collapsed suddenly following a deluge of customer withdrawals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's chief architect, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison following a conviction of fraud and other financial crimes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Auto-giant Toyota doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March, as strong vehicles sales and a favorable exchange rate lifted results for Japan’s top carmaker.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Toyota on Wednesday said its annual profit totaled 4.9 trillion yen, up from 2.45 trillion yen the year before, while its sales jumped 21 percent to 45 trillion yen.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The results exceeded Toyota’s own projection for a 4.5 trillion yen profit, as its global sales surged to 9.4 million vehicles from 8.8 million vehicles in the previous fiscal year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sales of hybrids performed well, although Toyota stressed it was working hard to offer various kinds of electric vehicles, including battery EVs, plug-ins and fuel cell models.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles during this fiscal year, with sales projected to grow in the US and the rest of Asia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Toyota said it will make key investments in areas such as research on technology in coming months to sustain long-term growth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It expects its net profit for the fiscal year through to March 2025 to decline nearly 28 percent to 3.57 trillion yen, with spending also covering investments in workers at suppliers and dealers it called “human capital.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The auto industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation away from old-style gasoline engines, especially in markets like China, where EVs dominate and some analysts say automakers like Toyota may have fallen behind. (AP)
