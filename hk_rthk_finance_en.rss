  <div class="itemFullText">
   OpenAI has raised US$6.6 billion from investors at a post-money valuation of US$157 billion, the company announced on Wednesday, cementing the ChatGPT maker's status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The funding has attracted returning venture capital investors including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, as well as OpenAI's biggest corporate backer Microsoft, and new participation from Nvidia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The closing of the funds coincides with the company's ongoing restructuring efforts and executive changes, including the abrupt departure of its longtime chief technology officer, Mira Murati, last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Altimeter Capital, Fidelity, SoftBank, Abu Dhabi's state-backed investment firm MGX also participated in the round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The funding came in the form of convertible notes, and hinges on a successful structural change into a for-profit that would no longer be controlled by the non-profit board and the removal of cap on returns for investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The personnel changes haven't deterred enthusiasm from most investors, who are anticipating significant growth based on the projections by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company is on pace to generate US$3.6 billion in revenue this year on mounting losses of over US$5 billion. It projects major revenue jump next year to US$11.6 billion, according to sources familiar with the figures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors have also secured some protections as OpenAI undergoes the complex corporate restructuring that would grant Altman equity. The talks are still ongoing, and no timeline has been determined yet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors have negotiated terms that would allow them to claw back their capital or renegotiate the valuation if the changes are not implemented within two years, sources said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   OpenAI's meteoric rise in terms of product popularity and valuation has captured the world's imagination. Since the launch of ChatGPT, it has attracted 250 million weekly active users.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company has told investors it is still actively pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning developing AI systems that surpass human intelligence, as it ramps up commercialisation and tries to be profitable. (Reuters)

      Wall Street flat as jobs data beats expectations

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The S&P 500 ended little changed on Wednesday, with technology shares gaining but investors nervous about Middle East tensions and more US labour data due this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nvidia shares rose 1.6 percent, helping to lift the S&P 500 technology index. However, Tesla shares fell 3.5 percent after the electric carmaker reported third-quarter vehicle deliveries below estimates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors monitored Mideast news after Israel and the US vowed to strike back following Iran's attack on Israel on Tuesday. US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he would not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its missile attack and urged Israel to act "proportionally."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Data released early on Wednesday showed US private payrolls increased more than expected in September, further evidence that the labour market is not deteriorating. Investors remained focused on September non-farm payrolls data due on Friday, while US jobless claims data is due on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have the jobs report Friday, and then earnings season starts at the end of next week," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're near all-time highs, and we know we have a friendly Fed out there. Before they push stocks to another round of new highs, investors want to hear some positive commentary from companies. People like that the Fed is very dovish and they are just waiting for another reason to push prices higher."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.09 percent, to 42,197. The S&P 500 gained 0.01 percent, at 5,710 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.08 percent, to 17,925.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   JPMorgan Chase and other big banks will kick off S&P 500 third-quarter earnings season on October 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A strike by 45,000 dockworkers halting shipments at US East Coast and Gulf Coast ports entered its second day on Wednesday with no negotiations scheduled between the two sides. The dockworkers' strike is costing the economy roughly US$5 billion per day, JPMorgan analysts estimated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among declining shares, Nike dropped 6.8 percent after the athletic footwear and apparel maker withdrew its annual revenue forecast just as a new chief executive is set to take charge. (Reuters)

      DAB urges govt to reduce stamp duty on stock trading
     </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   DAB lawmakers on Thursday called on the government to further reduce stamp duty on stock transactions to make the stock market more appealing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government reduced the stamp duty on stock transactions from 0.13 percent to 0.1 percent for both buyers and sellers in November last year, but DAB lawmaker Edmund Wong suggested that only sellers should pay the stamp duty of 0.1 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Most of the capital markets are now charging a zero stamp duty or a relatively low stamp duty. We believe that lowering the transaction cost is also essential for maintaining our competitiveness with the global markets, as well as in line with the global trend of a zero stamp duty tax rate," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Though it may affect government revenues in the long term, we believe that the applications could further enhance our competitiveness, as well as attracting the talent, and the money to Hong Kong for further investment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DAB lawmaker Rock Chen, meanwhile, said it took an average of eight months for companies to get newly listed in Hong Kong, which was double that in the US.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said Hong Kong should streamline its vetting and approval procedures for new listing applications as that would provide more certainty for companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For Hong Kong, the time to go through IPO applications is relatively lengthier than a lot of our international competitors, especially the US," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We propose a service pledge, meaning for both sides, the regulators and also the applicants, further enquiries must be issued within 22 business days, roughly one calendar month. So that would make the communication and the enquiries more effective."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chen said China's central bank unveiled a series of measures to boost the country's economy, which included cutting interest rates and rates on existing mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the measures would benefit Hong Kong, but the city should make its market more appealing, instead of only relying on external factors.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Retail sales were down 10.1 percent in August compared to the same month last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the sixth consecutive month of year-on-year declines, after an 11.8 percent drop in July and a 9.7 percent decrease in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sales of commodities in supermarkets, jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts saw the most dramatic drops.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first eight months of this year, the value of total sales edged down by 7.7 percent on a year-on-year basis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The value of total retail sales recorded a year-on-year decline in August amid the continued impact of the change in consumption patterns, the relatively strong Hong Kong dollar, and increased outbound travels by residents during the summer holidays, among other factors," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The executive director of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said the outlook for whole-year retail sales is gloomy, despite recent rate cuts and stock market rallies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As we can see that the start of Hong Kong's rate cuts circle in September and the recent surge in the stock market are favourable for strengthening the consumption atmosphere," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "However, there are still many uncertainties regarding the pace of rate cuts and the stock market is also expected to be unstable in the short term. At present, we still maintain our forecast that the overall retail sales for the entire year of 2024 will record a low double-digit decline."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Looking ahead, officials said retailers will continue to face headwinds, but economic growth, rising employment earnings and the US interest rate cut should offer support to the sector.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks slipped on Thursday, extending a downcast week as markets assessed tensions in the Middle East and awaited key US jobs data.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oil prices jumped after US President Joe Biden told reporters he was discussing possible Israeli retaliatory strikes on Iranian oil facilities. The move lifted petroleum-linked equities but pressured the broader market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There's a "lot of concern" that the Iran-Israel conflict will escalate, said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare. "So you have a little bit of a hesitation factor, not a lot of conviction on the part of buyers."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4 percent to 42,011.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The broad-based S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 4,699, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slipped less than 0.1 percent at 17,918.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Institute for Supply Management's services index jumped to 54.9 percent in September, above expectations and a boost to confidence in the US economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Markets are looking ahead to Friday's September jobs report, which will influence upcoming Federal Reserve decisions on whether to keep cutting interest rates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors are also monitoring a major US ports strike, which entered its third day and has potential to reignite inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Petroleum-linked shares advanced with oil prices. ConocoPhillips gained 1.8 percent and both Halliburton and Apache won about three percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Constellation Brands dropped 4.7 percent as the company's wine and spirits division experienced a 12 percent drop in quarterly sales compared with the year-ago period. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US dockworkers will return to work after a three-day strike at East and Gulf Coast ports after the union and port operators reached a tentative deal on pay and extended the current contract to January 15, both sides said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) had launched a work stoppage early Tuesday after negotiations with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents shipping companies and terminal operators, came to an impasse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike - which involved 45,000 workers, according to the ILA - paralysed 36 ports from Maine to Texas, which handle an array of goods from food to electronics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Thursday evening, the two sides announced in a joint statement that they had "reached a tentative agreement on wages and have agreed to extend the Master Contract until January 15, 2025 to return to the bargaining table to negotiate all other outstanding issues.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Effective immediately, all current job actions will cease and all work covered by the Master Contract will resume."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The statement did not offer terms of the deal, but The Wall Street Journal, citing sources close to the matter, said USMX had proposed a 62 percent salary increase over six years, which allowed the deal to be reached.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike was the first walkout by the union since 1977 after negotiations stalled over union demands for significant wage increases and protection against automation-related job loss.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US President Joe Biden -- who had been under pressure to intervene in negotiations to keep ports open, but had demurred citing respect for collective bargaining rights -- celebrated the suspension of the strike late Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to thank the union workers, the carriers, and the port operators for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding," Biden said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Collective bargaining works, and it is critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Outside the White House, Biden added: "They've got the next 90 days, they are going to settle everything."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Republican former president Donald Trump, who is seeking to take back the Oval Office, had blamed Biden for the crisis, saying Tuesday in Milwaukee: "He should have worked out a deal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts had cautioned that a lengthy strike could pose a major headwind to the US economy, leading to shortages of some items and lifting costs at a time when inflation has been moderating.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oxford Economics had estimated that the strike would dent US gross domestic product by US$4.5 billion to US$7.5 billion per week, with the overall impact depending on how long the strike lasts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Capital Economics said fears about the economic impact of the strike were "overdone," in part because recent shocks to the supply chain have made businesses more aware of the need to bake in precautionary measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike arrived at a politically precarious time, just one month before the US presidential election on November 5, but the tentative agreement relieves the political pressure. (AFP)

      EU members to vote on Chinese electric vehicle tariffs

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   European Union members face a pivotal vote on Friday on whether to impose tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles in the bloc's highest profile trade case, which risks retaliation from Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, proposed final duties for the next five years to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under EU rules, the Commission can impose the tariffs for the next five years unless a qualified majority of 15 EU countries representing 65 percent of the EU's population votes against the plan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reuters reported on Wednesday that France, Greece, Italy and Poland would vote in favour, enough to avert a blocking majority against tariffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the absence of a qualified majority either way, the EU executive can adopt the tariffs. However, it could also submit an amended proposal if it wanted to secure greater backing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The region's top economy and major car producer, Germany, will vote against the introduction of tariffs, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters late on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   German carmakers, for which China represents almost a third of their sales, have been particularly vocal against tariffs. Volkswagen said they were "the wrong approach".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The economy minister in Spain, a previous tariff backer, also said in a letter to European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, seen by Reuters on Thursday, that instead of imposing tariffs, the EU should "keep negotiations open... beyond the binding vote" to strike a deal on prices as well as the relocation of battery production to the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had already said on a visit to China that the EU should reconsider its position.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some EU members are nervous about Beijing's response. In moves seen as a retaliation, Beijing this year launched its own probes into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the EU's stance towards Beijing has hardened in the past five years, now viewing China as a potential partner in some issues, but also as a competitor and a systemic rival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commission says China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year, which needed to be exported, is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100 percent tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU executive has said it is willing to continue negotiating an alternative to tariffs with China and could re-examine a price undertaking - involving a minimum import price and typically a volume cap - having previously rejected those offered by Chinese companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One option under negotiation is minimum import prices calculated using criteria such as the range, battery performance and length of the electric vehicle, along with whether it is two- or four-wheel drive, a source familiar with the matter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tariffs range from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for SAIC and other companies deemed not to have cooperated with the EU investigation. These tariffs are on top of the EU's standard 10 percent import duty for cars. (Reuters)

   The Hang Seng Index fell 98.43 points, or 0.45 percent, to open at 22,015.08 points on Friday.

   Overnight the main Wall Street indices closed between 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent lower on concerns about an escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict, with oil prices spiking.

      EU greenlights new tariffs on Chinese EVs

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   EU countries on Friday gave a definitive green light to hefty additional tariffs on electric cars (EVs) made in China, despite strong opposition led by Germany.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten countries including France and Italy supported slapping tariffs of up to 35.3 percent, on top of the current 10 percent, EU diplomats said, while five including Germany and Hungary voted against and 12 abstained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission provisionally approved additional duties in June after an inquiry concluded that Beijing's state aid to auto manufacturers was unfair.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China has slammed the new tariffs as "protectionist" and warned they would trigger a trade war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brussels says it aims to protect European carmakers in a critical industry that provides jobs to around 14 million people across the EU.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canada and the United States have in recent months imposed much higher tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese electric car imports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier on Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban warned the EU was headed for an "economic cold war" if it placed tariffs on Chinese EVs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   German auto giant Mercedes-Benz said the tariffs were a "mistake", urging the European Commission to delay their implementation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are convinced that punitive tariffs worsen the competitiveness of an industry in the long term," the company said in a statement. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Commerce Ministry in Beijing has firmly opposed the European Union’s decision to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, describing the move as protectionist and a grave violation of World Trade Organisation regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement on Friday, the ministry added the tariffs disrupted the international trade order, and threatened the global effort to tackle climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China has all along demonstrated the utmost sincerity to resolve the differences through dialogue. Since the end of June, the two sides have engaged in more than 10 discussions on the matter," a spokesman said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The imposition of tariffs will not solve matters, and instead “rattle and impede” the confidence and determination of Chinese enterprises to invest in Europe, he warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The spokesman once again urged the EU to return to the negotiating table, and vowed to take all necessary measures to defend the interests of Chinese firms.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks jumped on Friday, concluding the week higher following strong jobs data and the resolution of a US ports strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world's biggest economy added 254,000 jobs last month, far above analyst expectations, as the unemployment rate dipped from 4.2 percent to 4.1 percent, according to US Department of Labor data.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dockworkers at ports on the East and Gulf coasts were also heading back on the job after union leaders and shippers reached a tentative agreement, ending a three-day stoppage that threatened the US economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 finished at 5,751, up 0.9 percent for the day and enough to coax out a weekly 0.2 percent gain despite losses earlier in the week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8 percent to 42,352, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added 1.2 percent at 18,137.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Across every dimension, the September employment report showed a job market that was stronger than expected," said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "All of these signs point toward a successful 'soft landing,' but also stoke worries that inflation may not move in a straight line to the Fed's two percent target. This report could certainly slow the expected pace of rate cuts."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gains were broad-based, with all but two of the S&P 500's 11 sectors advancing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Spirit Airlines sank nearly 25 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that the carrier is exploring a bankruptcy filing. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said a new list of strategic enterprises would be announced next month, which includes more than 10 companies with over half in the fields of artificial intelligence and big data.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said these companies come from the mainland, the US and Europe, and some are leaders in their fields.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also noted the market was doing better heading into the fourth quarter, with the Hang Seng Index reaching its highest in about 2.5 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can be expected that the market recovery and investors' cautious optimism about the future will drive many companies to speed up their listing process in Hong Kong, including many tech startups," Chan wrote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the same time, this will also encourage more enterprises to set up offices in Hong Kong. This trend also shows that the SAR government's efforts to enhance market competitiveness are starting to pay off."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The finance minister also said he would lead a delegation of financial and tech leaders to the Middle East at the end of this month to promote Hong Kong's strengths under the One Country, Two Systems principle.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of the Real Estate Developers Association, Stewart Leung, on Sunday said the local property market would gradually rebound after second-hand property prices in August dropped to their lowest point in eight years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a TV programme, Leung said Hong Kong’s stock market had benefited from policies to stimulate the Chinese economy which were rolled out by the central authorities last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was optimistic this would have a positive effect on the city's property market.
   <br/>

   “If the economy is slow, there is no way the property market will thrive. The stock market is a starting point. If the stock market performance improves, other things will see a chance. When people earn money, they will be able to buy things, and of course buying a house is one of the most important events in life. If the economy can recover, the property market will be able to improve,” Leung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leung said it would take some time for the property market to see an improvement after policies are implemented.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Stock markets are the most sensitive as their exchanges can be done very quickly. But for the property market, buildings cannot be built immediately after we think about building something,” Leung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leung said he earlier predicted property prices to increase by five to 10 percent this year because he believed Hong Kong’s economy would be able to recover faster than other places due to its smaller size.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that property rolled out by developers would raise their prices in the short term as market prospects improve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When asked whether he would buy a property, Leung said he does not speculate and that purchasing a flat depends on whether the buyer can afford the price.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Vietnam's economy grew by 7.4 percent in the third quarter, government figures showed Sunday, despite severe economic damage caused by Typhoon Yagi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vietnam suffered US$3.3 billion in economic losses as a result of Yagi which swept across the country's north, causing devastating flooding and 345 deaths.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The growth rate was the result of "adapting effectively to the fluctuations of the global economy and addressing the severe consequences of natural disasters", the General Statistics Office (GSO) said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agriculture, forestry and the fishery sector was particularly affected by Yagi, the GSO said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But exports were up 15.8 percent compared to the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Vietnamese government is aiming to reach an economic growth rate of 6.8 to seven percent for 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Asian Development Bank (ADB) warned in September that "geopolitical tensions and uncertainties related to the United States election in November could lead to trade fragmentation, adversely affecting exports, manufacturing activity, and employment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States was Vietnam's largest export market in the first nine months of 2024, according to the GSO.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ADB also said that Vietnam was still in the recovery phase after the storm, and the estimated damage figures may not yet be final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   S&P Global Market Intelligence said that manufacturing production dropped sharply in September, with new orders down and firms unable to complete or export orders they had.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ADB predicts six percent growth for Vietnam's year-end figure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The communist state has long been a success story among Asian economies and in 2022 its economy grew eight percent. (AFP)

  <img alt="Economy Minister Robert Habeck will unveil the forecast on Wednesday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773453_1_20241006213607.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The German government has slashed its forecast and now expects Europe's largest economy to shrink for a second year running as hopes for a consumption-driven recovery fizzle out, media reported on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The economy ministry sees the German economy contracting by 0.2 percent this year, a dramatic downgrade from its prior estimate of 0.3-percent growth, according to the Sueddeutsche newspaper.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Economy Minister Robert Habeck will officially unveil the latest forecasts on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Germany was the only major advanced economy to contract in 2023, hit hard by an industrial slowdown, cooling export demand and surging energy prices following Russia's assault on Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expectations that easing inflation and the first interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank would drive a recovery this year have however seemed increasingly out of reach in recent months, as demand at home and abroad remained weak.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Germany's leading economic institutes have also recently downgraded their forecasts, and now expect the economy to either stagnate or shrink by 0.1 percent this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Instead of gaining momentum, the economy continues to be characterised by a general reluctance by consumers to spend," the Sueddeutsche said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The economic headwinds come as Germany also faces structural challenges including increased competition from China, a shortage of skilled workers and a complex green transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nevertheless, the German government was optimistic in its outlook for 2025, the newspaper reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Habeck's economy ministry will on Wednesday say it now expects 1.1-percent growth next year, according to Sueddeutsche, up from one percent in the previous forecast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By 2026, the economy is expected to expand 1.6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government's proposed "growth initiative" has a key role to play in the recovery, Habeck told the Sueddeutsche.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures include tax relief, permanently reduced energy prices for industry, less red tape and incentives to keep older people in the workforce as well as attract foreign skilled workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The German economy can grow significantly stronger in the next two years if the measures are fully implemented," Habeck was quoted as saying. (AFP)

  <img alt="Stocks were down around 1 percent on all three major Wall Street Indices.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street's three major indexes closed down around 1% on Monday while Treasury yields rose, as traders tamped down bets for Federal Reserve interest-rate easing and worried about the Middle East conflict's impact on oil prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors also braced for another big hurricane, Milton, which is expected to hit the United States this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Further dampening sentiment on Monday was an order from a US judge for market heavyweight Alphabet's Google to overhaul its mobile-app business to give Android phone users more options. Analyst reports also spurred selling of Amazon.com and Apple Inc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a combination of things over the last couple of days: the jobs report, the hurricane damage, the elevated energy prices and negative comments about some of the large-cap tech names," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "All of that combined just makes for a nervous day, and the Google headlines tipped things over to more aggressive selling in the last hour."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   James pointed to the Middle East conflict as a concern for US investors who are worried about the war's economic impact, including rising oil prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors continue to fret about how Israel would respond to Iran's missile strikes. On Monday, Lebanon's armed group Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel's city of Haifa while Israeli forces looked poised to expand ground raids into south Lebanon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398 points, or 0.9%, to 41,954, the S&P 500 lost 55 points, or 1%, to 5,695 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 213 points, or 1.2%, to 17,923.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry indexes, only energy advanced, finishing up 0.4%.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US crude futures settled up 3.7% in their fifth-straight advance on concerns about Middle East supply disruptions. (Reuters)

      Partial victory for Man City in Premier League dispute

  <img alt="City claimed a partial victory over the Premier League after an arbitration panel ruled on sponsorship deals. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773606_1_20241008084426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City claimed a partial victory over the Premier League on Monday after an arbitration panel ruled on sponsorship deals, known as Associated Party Transactions (APT), that the Abu Dhabi-owned club was blocked from completing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League put its own spin on what some commentators saw as a landmark verdict, saying the panel's redacted 175-page document endorsed the overall objectives and decision-making of the APT system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The panel found parts of the league's APT rules broke British competition law, however, and were also unlawful because clubs were unable to comment on types of data the league would take into account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League's decision in relation to two City transactions in 2023, with First Abu Dhabi Bank and Etihad Aviation group, were "reached in a procedurally unfair manner" and must be overturned, the panel ruled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   APT rules were designed to maintain the Premier League's competitiveness by preventing clubs from inflating the value of sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City said in a statement it had succeeded with their claim and the Premier League was found, among other things, to have abused its dominant position.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Tribunal has determined both that the rules are structurally unfair and that the Premier League was specifically unfair in how it applied those rules to the Club in practice," City added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The rules were found to be discriminatory in how they operate, because they deliberately excluded shareholder loans," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League said the majority of City's challenges had been rejected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moreover, the Tribunal found that the rules are necessary in order for the League’s financial controls to be effective," it added in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reigning champions City are also involved in a separate independent hearing into the club's alleged breaches of Premier League financial regulations which began in September, with a verdict expected some time before the end of the current season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The club have won eight Premier League titles, the Champions League, three FA Cups, six League Cups, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup since being bought by Sheikh Mansour's Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League introduced a temporary ban on clubs being sponsored by firms linked to their owners following the sale of Newcastle United to a consortium dominated by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in 2021. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Economy-boosting stimulus measures from Beijing have sent mainland markets soaring. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773613_1_20241008094444.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland stocks soared more than 10 percent at the open on Tuesday as traders resumed a blistering rally after a week-long break hoping for more economy-boosting measures from Beijing, which unveiled a slew of stimulus last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai Composite Index surged 10.13 percent, or 337 points, to 3,674, to its highest point since mid-2022 while the Shenzhen Composite Index piled on 11.37 percent, or 219 points, to 2,146, its best level since December 2021.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before the break, China announced the most aggressive stimulus measures since the pandemic and the CSI300 gained 25 percent over five sessions. Turnover soared as heavy buying strained brokers and trading systems, and last Monday the CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite both notched their largest gains since 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have cut rates and hinted at fiscal support to shore up an economy that, by Chinese standards, is ailing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before the Golden Week holiday break, hedge fund manager David Tepper said on CNBC the moves were encouraging enough that he would buy "everything" on China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But gains have been so large that others now urge caution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China's weighting in the MSCI EM Index rose from 24 percent in August to 30 percent now, and its continued out-performance may drive a self-reinforcing 'pain-trade' before the year-end," Bank of America analysts said in a note on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they said, the "'buy everything' stage will be over soon," with market momentum, fiscal support, earnings, the US election and further policy settings all part of the outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Consumer, property (and) broker stocks could be profit-taking candidates ... big cap internet and high-yield SOEs are our preferred exposure," they said. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee has vowed to work with authorities across the border to enhance measures facilitating mutual access between financial markets on the mainland and in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a forum on Tuesday, Lee hailed the Greater Bay Area as "an important testing ground and participant" for mutual market access.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the administration would continue to make good use of Hong Kong's leading advantages as a financial centre, while calling on political and business leaders to capitalise on the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The SAR government will continue to work closely with relevant mainland departments and trades to continuously optimise various mutual access measures, promote the integration of financial markets in the Greater Bay Area, work for the country's development strategy on being a financial powerhouse, and achieve high-quality development," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "All political and business leaders should also make good use of the countless opportunities in the Greater Bay Area to work together for a win-win situation."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun Yu, vice-chairman and chief executive of Bank of China (Hong Kong), urged the city to "take the initiative" to attract more businesses from all over the world to invest and operate in Hong Kong and other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added the SAR should strive to further develop into an investment and financial centre for emerging markets, to bring in companies with development potential from Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong stocks nosedived on Tuesday, losing more than 9 percent, while mainland markets reopened after a weeklong holiday with solid gains as Beijing expressed confidence that it will meet its economic targets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hang Seng Index had shed more than 5.5 percent, or nearly 1,300 points, in morning trade, and the sell-off continued in the afternoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The index finished the day 9.4 percent or 2,172 points lower at 20,926, the biggest drop in 16 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turnover topped HK$620 billion, a fresh record high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Losses were recorded across the board.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a different story on the mainland, with the Shanghai Composite Index up 4.59 percent to 3,489 and the Shenzhen Component Index putting on 9.17 percent at 11,495.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares had hit two-year peaks in early trade before giving up some of those gains.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a press briefing in Beijing, the head of the National Development and Reform Commission, Zheng Shanjie, said China is fully confident of achieving economic targets for 2024 and would pull forward 200 billion yuan from next year's budget to spend on investment projects and support local governments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But some investors were left disappointed by what they see as a lack of new stimulus. (Agencies)

      China to impose anti-dumping measures on EU brandy

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China has imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on brandy imports from the European Union (EU), hitting brands from Hennessy to Remy Martin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday that an investigation has preliminarily determined that dumping of brandy, or the act of exporting goods to a foreign market at a low price, from the EU is threatening the nation's own brandy sector with "substantial damage".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that as of October 11, importers of brandy originating in the EU will have to put down security deposits, mostly ranging from 34.8 percent to 39 percent of the import value.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   France, which supported tariffs on mainland-made electric vehicles (EVs), accounted for 99 percent of China's brandy imports last year, with brandy shipments from the country reaching US$1.7 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hennessy and Remy Martin were among the brands worst-hit, with importers having to pay security deposits of 39 and 38.1 percent, respectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures came on the heels of the EU's move to adopt tariffs on China-made EVs by the end of October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In that decision, the bloc set tariff rates ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for SAIC and other producers deemed not to have cooperated with the EU's anti-subsidy investigation. These will come on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing called the tariffs protectionist and a violation of World Trade Organisation regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission has said it's willing to continue negotiating an alternative, even after tariffs are imposed. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street advanced on Tuesday as tech shares gained and oil prices fell, while investors assessed unrest in the Middle East.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to 42,080, while the S&P 500 added 1.0 percent to 5,751.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq jumped 1.5 percent to 18,182.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Technology is up, and that's helping the sentiment of the market," said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Nvidia shares were up 4.1 percent while Facebook parent Meta Platforms increased 1.4 percent and Microsoft rose 1.3 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cardillo added that a pullback in oil prices was another positive for the market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Oil prices were moving up on anticipation of a retaliation move by Iran. And so far, that hasn't happened," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brent, the international benchmark, and US contract West Texas Intermediate both slipped by 4.6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This likely reflected a shift in focus, back on demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an interview published on Tuesday, New York Federal Reserve president John Williams also told the Financial Times that the central bank's bold interest rate cut in September is not necessarily an indication of how it will act in the coming months. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Shanghai stocks tumbled more than four percent at the open on Wednesday after racking up big gains a day earlier following a week-long break, but Hong Kong clawed back some of the losses of more than nine percent it suffered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai Composite Index shed 4.54 percent, or 158 points, to 3,331, and the Shenzhen Composite Index dropped 4.31 percent, or 90 points, to 2,008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both bourses saw big gains the day before but were well off their initial highs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hang Seng Index gained 1.74 percent, or 363 points, to 21,290, having tanked more than nine percent on Tuesday, its biggest loss since the 2008 global financial crisis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Equities in the mainland and Hong Kong rocketed after China last month began announcing measures aimed at boosting the world's number two economy, piling on more than 20 percent each.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, a much-anticipated news conference in Beijing on Tuesday – after the Golden Week break – left traders disappointed as officials refused to unveil more stimulus and provided scant detail on the measures already pledged. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said Hong Kong should position itself as Asia's leading green financing hub due to it making significant strides in green and sustainable finance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Citing the size of green bonds and debts, and the number of green funds setting up in Hong Kong over the past three years, Chan expressed optimism about the city's potential to emerge as a leading hub in Asia for transition finance -- which seeks to support high-emission sectors in their journey towards sustainability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong already has a very strong foundation to develop the transition finance market – including a robust regulatory framework, the necessary financial infrastructure, a well-developed market, and expertise on standard-setting and compliance. What we need now is to raise the awareness of the necessity of transition finance and the potential it offers," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also addressed the importance of developing a taxonomy for sustainable finance. He said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is working on a taxonomy that will incorporate transition activities, with plans for public consultation in early 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan emphasised the need for improved sustainability disclosures at the company level to enable investors to evaluate corporate commitments to environmental standards. He said Hong Kong aims to align its local sustainability disclosure requirements with those set by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

      Boeing suspends negotiations with striking workers

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing on Tuesday suspended talks with its striking workers as it accused the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) of making unreasonable demands and withdrew its offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The union made non-negotiable demands far in excess of what can be accepted if we are to remain competitive as a business," the US aerospace giant said in an email to employees late Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Given that position, further negotiations do not make sense at this point and our offer has been withdrawn."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 33,000 Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest have been on strike for nearly a month in a fight focused on higher wages and improved retirement benefits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workers complain of more than a decade of near-flat wages during a period when inflation has risen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing's most recent offer included a 30 percent wage hike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Negotiations, which included the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, resumed on Monday and continued into Tuesday, but no agreement was reached.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our team bargained in good faith and made new and improved proposals to try to reach a compromise, including increases in take-home pay and retirement," Boeing said in the email, adding that "the union did not seriously consider our proposals."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We remain committed to finding a resolution and will work with the union when they are ready to bargain an agreement that recognises our employees and preserves our company's future," the email read.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the company announced earlier on Tuesday that it had delivered 33 new aircraft to customers in September in spite of the strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The aerospace giant delivered 27 Boeing 737 MAX jets assembled in Renton, Washington, which has gone quiet since the strike launched on September 13.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 737 MAX planes were cleared for delivery by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to Boeing, which expects fewer deliveries in the coming period due to the strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Airlines receiving new MAX planes included United Airlines, Ryanair, Southwest Airlines, Air India, China Southern Airlines and Shenzhen Airlines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing also delivered four 787 Dreamliner planes, which are assembled at a non-union plant in Charleston, South Carolina that is not out on strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing has delivered 291 aircraft through the end of the third quarter, down 22 percent from the same period in 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prior to the IAM strike, which has also shuttered an Everett plant where the 777 is assembled, the FAA had limited Boeing's production following a January incident on Alaska Airlines in which a panel blew out mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Stocks in Hong Kong and the mainland tumbled on another volatile day on Wednesday after Beijing disappointed investors over a lack of fresh stimulus and scant detail on its plans for implementing a raft of measures already unveiled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After blockbuster performances in the wake of last month's announcements to kickstart growth, traders were left deflated after a news conference on Tuesday fell short of expectations and revived worries about the outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After swinging in the morning, the Hang Seng Index closed down 1.4 percent at 20,637.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turnover reached HK$427 billion, down from a record HK$620 billion on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai Composite Index closed down 6.6 percent at 3,258 and the Shenzhen Component Index finished 8.15 percent lower at 10,557.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Sales of US automaker Tesla's China-made electric vehicles rose 19.2 percent in September from a year earlier, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Wednesday. Deliveries of China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles were up 1.9 percent from the previous month. The company has already announced quarterly global deliveries but had not detailed sales in China. Chinese rival BYD, with its Dynasty and Ocean lineups of EVs and plug-in hybrids, recorded its best month with a 45.56 percent year-on-year increase in passenger vehicle sales to 417,603 units in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 33,012 BYD cars, or 7.9 percent of the total sales, were sold overseas, BYD's filing showed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the September gain, Tesla saw 12 percent growth in China-made EV sales in the July-September period, its first quarterly rise this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US EV giant has been extending incentives to encourage consumers in the world's largest auto market where rivals including Xpeng and Nio were racing to launch new budget models.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It extended zero-interest financing in late September for some Model 3 and Model Y cars in China by another month to the end of October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tesla also plans to produce a six-seat variant of its best-selling, yet aging, Model Y in China from late 2025, Reuters reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EV maker, due to unveil its robotaxi on Oct. 10, said it was on course to launch Full Self-Driving (FSD) advanced driver assistance software in China and Europe next year, pending approval from regulators. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Both the Dow and S&P 500 rocketed to fresh records on Wednesday behind gains in technology shares as markets monitored a major US hurricane and digested Federal Reserve minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Major tech names such as Apple and Amazon won more than one percent in a move analysts characterised as a "buy-the-dip" bounce after weakness in recent sessions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fed minutes showed a divided group of policy makers, belying a one-sided vote last month for a large interest rate cut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones jumped 1.0 percent to 42,512, topping a record from late September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 climbed 0.7 percent to 5,792, also a record, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.6 percent to 18,291.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Florida residents fled – or defied warnings and tried to take shelter – on Wednesday in the final hours before Hurricane Milton, a lethal Category 4 storm, roars out of the ocean and tears across the state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial markets were looking ahead to Thursday's consumer price index report, expected to influence future Fed actions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An exception among tech stocks was Alphabet, which fell 1.6 percent after the Department of Justice said on Tuesday it would demand that Google make profound changes to how it does business and even consider the possibility of a breakup, after the tech juggernaut was found to be running an illegal monopoly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing sank 3.4 percent as the aerospace giant suspended negotiations with its striking workers in the Pacific Northwest after two days of talks with the machinist union yielded no breakthrough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   S&P put Boeing on credit watch negative on Tuesday, pointing to "strike-related financial risk."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The action "reflects the increased likelihood of a downgrade if the strike persists toward the end of the year, further constraining the recovery in the company's cash flow generation and the company does not raise capital sufficient to meet its upcoming needs in such a way that does not increase financial leverage," S&P said.

      Central bank opens up 500bn yuan swap facility

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's central bank said on Thursday it would start accepting applications from financial institutions to join a newly created funding scheme, initially worth 500 billion yuan, to aid the capital market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said eligible securities firms, fund companies and insurers can apply to join the swap scheme, which gives them easier access to funding to buy stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC first announced the scheme on September 24 as part of a broad package of policies to stimulate the economy and boost capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the swap facility, eligible securities firms, fund companies and insurers can use their assets including bonds, stock ETFs and holdings in constituents of the CSI 300 Index as collateral in exchange for highly liquid assets such as treasury bonds and central bank bills.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The initial scale of the swap program is set at 500 billion yuan, and can be expanded in the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement came after mainland stocks tumbled on Wednesday following a blistering rally in response to one of Beijing’s most aggressive stimulus package in years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC had slashed interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several major cities – including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen – have also further eased restrictions on buying homes, and top officials including Premier Li Qiang have called for more effective implementation of the slate of measures.(Agencies)

      Indian tycoon Ratan Tata dies aged 86

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ratan Tata, a former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons hailed as a visionary business leader, died at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday night. He was 86.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran confirmed Tata’s death and described him in a statement as his “friend, mentor, and guide.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He did not provide a cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata was admitted this week to the Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai, the city where he lived.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soon after he was hospitalised, Tata issued a statement on Monday saying there was no cause for concern regarding his health and he was undergoing checkups for age-related medical conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Tata as a visionary leader, and a compassionate and extraordinary human being.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond boardrooms," Modi said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tata endeared himself to people, thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,” Modi said, referring to his philanthropy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Ratan Tata left behind an extraordinary business and philanthropic legacy and he was instrumental in mentoring and developing modern business leadership in India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My last meeting with Ratan Tata at Google, we talked about the progress of Waymo and his vision was inspiring to hear,” Pichai said on X. "He deeply cared about making India better.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said, “It is a very sad day for India and India Inc," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ratan Tata’s passing away is a big loss, not just to the Tata Group, but to every Indian.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata received the Padma Bhushan, one of India’s most distinguished civilian awards, in 2000 and "Padma Vibhushan" in 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata Group is a sprawling collection of nearly 100 companies, including the country’s largest automaker, the largest private steel company and a leading outsourcing firm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The companies employ more than 350,000 people worldwide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In June 2008, Tata bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford for US$2.3 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched an airline in 1932 that later became Air India. The government later took it over.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata Group bought state-owned Air India in 2021. It also started a full-service carrier, Vistara, with Singapore Airlines, but recently merged it with Air India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata companies include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power and the information technology company Tata Consultancy Services. (AP)

   Asian markets tracked a record day on Wall Street Thursday, with Shanghai and Hong Kong supported by the People's Bank of China's move to boost liquidity for major stock-buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.86 percent, or 795 points, to 21,432.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.57 percent, or 83 points, to 3,342, and the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange advanced 2.21 percent, or 42 points, to 1,959.

   Traders cheered as China's central bank fleshed out plans to encourage "the healthy and stable development of the capital market" by opening up a "swap facility" worth 500 billion yuan that will allow firms to access cash to buy stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Companies will be allowed to use equities, bonds and other assets as collateral for "high-grade liquid assets such as treasury bonds and central bank bills", it said.
   <br/>

   The programme may be "further expanded depending on the situation", it added. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China will resume imports of Australian lobster by year-end, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday, marking the end of a four-year diplomatic fight that saw tens of billions of dollars of Australian exports locked out of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albanese said he agreed on the timeline to resume full lobster trade by year end during a meeting with Premier Li Qiang on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Laos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This, of course, will be in time for Chinese New Year and this will be welcomed by the people engaged in the live lobster industry in places like Geraldton, and South Australia and Tasmania, and so many parts of particularly regional Australia," Albanese said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China first imposed unofficial bans and tariffs on Australian goods ranging from coal to wine and rock lobster in late 2020 after years of tensions that culminated in Canberra calling for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before Thursday's announcement, all the restrictions on bar lobster had been removed as relations between the major trading partners improved.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li said the progress reached on the issue showed that China-Australia relations were promising, as long as the two sides continued to work towards a common goal. (Reuters/Xinhua)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US consumer inflation cooled slightly less than expected last month, according to government data published on Thursday, providing further evidence that price pressures are easing ahead of November's presidential election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 2.4 percent in September from a year ago, down from 2.5 percent in August, the Labor Department said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was slightly below the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was also some cause for concern for the Federal Reserve as it looks to cut interest rates: A measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy costs rose slightly to 3.3 percent, up from 3.2 percent in August, buoyed by a jump in the transportation services index last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Monthly headline inflation rose by 0.2 percent, while core inflation also exceeded forecasts to increase by 0.3 percent. Both monthly figures also exceeded expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite the "slight upward surprise relative to what we're expecting," the inflation picture isn't all bad, Oxford Economics' deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the broader trend in services inflation, I think I'm still confident in the view that that's going to continue to trend lower over the next 12 months," he said, referring to easing of services inflation from 0.2 percent in August to 0.2 percent in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The economy has remained a top concern for voters going into the upcoming presidential election, in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is running against the Republican former president Donald Trump.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both candidates have looked to talk up their record in government while criticizing their opponent's economic plans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While inflation has eased toward the Federal Reserve's long-term target of two percent, the labour market has shown some signs of cooling in recent months, causing policymakers to refocus their attention on the employment side of the bank's dual mandate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Against this backdrop, the Fed voted last month to cut interest rates by half a percentage-point and pencilled in an additional half point of cuts this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thursday's inflation data "supports a more measured pace of rate cuts," Pearce from Oxford Economics said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think they're still confident that inflation is heading down, but obviously that, you know, we will see noisy reports like today's," he added. "It's going to be a bumpy process. It's not a glide path down to down to two percent." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street's main indices closed lower on Thursday as investors looked to higher-than-expected inflation and unemployment claims for indications on the health of the US economy and the path for interest rates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent on a monthly basis in September and 2.4% on an annual basis, with both figures being slightly higher than estimated by economists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The core figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.3 percent year-over-year, versus an estimate of 3.2 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a separate report released on Thursday, jobless claims also rose to 258,000 for the week ending Oct. 5, versus an estimate of 230,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Investors were torn between a stronger than expected CPI report and a weaker than expected unemployment claims report," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital in Chicago. "One showed inflation running hotter than expected and the other showed the economy looking weaker than expected. It's the worst of both worlds."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the economic data, traders were pricing in a roughly 80 percent probability that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in November and a roughly 20 percent chance it would leave rates unchanged, according to CME's FedWatch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic on Thursday said he would be "totally comfortable" skipping an interest-rate cut at an upcoming meeting of the US central bank, adding that the "choppiness" in recent data on inflation and employment may warrant leaving rates on hold in November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he sees "gradual" rate cuts over the next year-and-a-half, while the New York Fed's John Williams said he still sees rate reductions ahead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to preliminary data, the Dow Jones fell 0.13 percent to 42,456, the S&P fell 0.20 percent, closing at 5,780 and the Nasdaq fell 0.05 percent to finish at 18,281.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both the S&P 500 and the Dow had notched record closing highs in the previous day's session. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to fresh records on Friday behind solid bank earnings, adding to weekly gains, as markets shrugged off mixed economic data.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up 1.0 percent to 42,863.86, an all-time high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 5,815.03, also a record, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.3 percent to 18,342.94.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dow member JPMorgan Chase rose more than four percent as it reported better than expected earnings behind higher revenues for equity trading and increased fees for asset management and investment banking.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors also cheered the bank's assessment that the US economy remains "resilient" and poised to avoid a recession.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The bank earnings were an excuse to rally, not necessarily a reason to rally," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. "Right now the market mentality is to rally, and it's going to do that... unless it has a reason not to, and there was no reason not to today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Markets digested data showing US wholesale prices were flat in September and a dip in US consumer confidence in October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts have said the latest inflation data likely reduces the odds of another large interest cut by the Federal Reserve in November, but doesn't eliminate the chance for a smaller reduction.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expectations for Fed relief on interest rates has propelled the market for much of 2024.

   Among other individual stocks, Tesla slumped 8.7 percent after Elon Musk demonstrated an electric Robotaxi without steering wheels or pedals at a long-awaited event in Los Angeles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A JPMorgan Chase note described the Tesla presentation as "underwhelming," saying it was "notably lacking in detail." (AFP)

      Boeing to cut 10% of workforce as it sees big Q3 loss

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing announced that it plans to cut 10 percent of its workforce as it projected a large third-quarter loss amid a machinist strike in the Seattle region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The aviation giant must "reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality," Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg said on Friday, adding that the cuts of 17,000 positions globally "will include executives, managers and employees."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company announced a series of belt-tightening measures and production delays as the nearly monthlong strike of 33,000 workers has added to the company's litany of problems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing staff with the International Association of Machinists (IAM) and Aerospace Workers walked off the job on September 13 after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing, which has also faced significant scrutiny over commercial aviation safety lapses and stumbles in its Starliner space program, said the IAM strike contributed to US$3 billion in pre-tax charges to its commercial aviation results in the third quarter, part of an anticipated loss of US$9.97 per share.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "While our business is facing near-term challenges, we are making important strategic decisions for our future and have a clear view on the work we must do to restore our company," Ortberg said in a press release.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These decisive actions, along with key structural changes to our business, are necessary to remain competitive over the long term."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Details of the cuts would come next week, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As a result of the strike, Boeing said it is pushing back first delivery of the 777X to 2026 from 2025. The much-delayed jet was originally supposed to enter service in January 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company plans to cease production of the 767 Freighter in 2027 once it completes production on current orders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The striking workers are seeking hefty wage hikes and a reinstatement of their pension, complaining of more than a decade of near-flat wages amid inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ratings agency S&P estimated this week that the strike was costing Boeing US$1 billion per month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Boeing fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading. (AFP)

   The annual return rate of the pension funds entrusted for investment by local governments in China has reached 5 percent since the end of 2016, according to a report released on Saturday by the National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The local pension fund is part of the basic pension fund. The central government started market operation of the basic pension fund in December 2016, with the aim of preserving and increasing its value.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, the local pension funds managed by the NCSSF have earned an investment income of 306.67 billion yuan, achieving an average annual investment return rate of 5 percent, according to the report.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2023, investment income of the local pension funds amounted to 39.58 billion yuan, with an investment return rate of 2.42 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The report went on to say that the total assets of the basic pension funds had reached over 2.23 trillion yuan by the end of 2023. (CCTV)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Commerce Ministry said on Saturday that talks in Brussels over the European Union's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles have ended with "major differences" remaining.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last Friday, Brussels voted to impose additional new tariffs of up to 35.3 percent on imports of Chinese-made electric cars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Representatives from Beijing and the 27-member bloc have held eight rounds of talks over the issue in Brussels since September 20.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are still major differences between the two sides," a ministry statement said, adding that it has invited EU negotiators for further discussions in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Negotiators "made important progress in some areas," the statement said, but "have not reached a solution acceptable to both sides".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is hoped that the EU can meet China halfway, arrange to come to China as soon as possible, and accelerate the consultations with a constructive attitude, so as to reach a proper solution as soon as possible," the statement said.
   <br/>

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's consumer inflation rate slowed in September, official data showed on Sunday, while producer price deflation deepened.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.4 percent year-on-year in September, down from the 0.6 percent increase recorded in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the producer price index (PPI) fell at the fastest pace in six months, down 2.8 percent year-on-year in September, versus a 1.8 percent decline the previous month
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The slowdown comes as authorities have been seeking to boost domestic activity and shore up China's property sector, with officials on Saturday announcing plans for a significant fiscal stimulus package.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finance Minister Lan Fo'an told a news conference there will be more "counter-cyclical measures" this year, but officials did not provide details on the size or timing of fiscal stimulus being prepared, which investors hope will ease deflationary pressures in the world's second-largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China faces persistent deflationary pressure due to weak domestic demand. The change of fiscal policy stance as indicated by the press conference yesterday (Saturday) would help to deal with such problems," said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland authorities have stepped up stimulus efforts in recent weeks to spur demand and help meet an around 5 percent economic growth target for this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In recent weeks, policymakers have unveiled a string of measures in a bid to stimulate activity and spur household consumption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank in late September announced the most aggressive monetary support measures since the Covid-19 pandemic, including numerous steps to help pull the property sector out of a severe, multi-year slump, including mortgage rate cuts. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of the accounting regulatory body has been appointed chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kelvin Wong will take up the SFC post from October 24 on a three-year term and will step down as head of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (AFRC) on December 31.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong was a non-executive director of the SFC from 2012 to 2018 and a member of the listing committee of Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited from 2007 to 2013.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Wong has been dedicated to serving the financial services industry, with extensive experience in the operation of the securities and futures markets, capital market development, corporate governance and financial regulatory matters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I expect that under Dr Wong's leadership, the SFC will continue to uphold its dual role as a regulator and facilitator of market development to ensure the fair, transparent and orderly operation of the local securities and futures markets, and to strive for reforms and innovations, with a view to solidifying and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre," Chan said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Incumbent SFC chairman Tim Lui will complete his six-year term on October 19.

      China's export growth slows sharply in September

  <img alt="Export growth slowed sharply while imports remained sluggish, as authorities wait for recent stimulus measures to perk up weak domestic demand. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774457_1_20241014173744.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's exports grew at the slowest pace in five months in September, suggesting manufacturers are no longer rushing out orders ahead of tariffs from several trade partners and that global demand for Chinese goods is softening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 2.4 percent year on year by value last month, customs data showed on Monday, missing a forecast of six percent increase by a poll of economists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Exports rose 8.7 percent in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Imports edged up 0.3 percent, missing expectations for a 0.9 percent increase and in contrast to the previous figure of 0.5 percent growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's exports grew at their fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years in August, but economists cautioned that officials in the country should avoid becoming too reliant on global demand as they work to bolster overall growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, officials in Beijing announced plans to ramp up debt issuance to aid local governments in managing their debt problems and provide increased support to low-income earners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they did not state the size of the fiscal stimulus at the highly anticipated news conference, disappointing markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts anticipate it will take a long time to restore consumer and business confidence and get the US$19 trillion economy on a more solid footing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A housing market recovery, in particular, could be a long way off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, the head of China's state planner said he was "fully confident" of achieving the government's full-year growth target of around five percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in September, with new export orders falling to their worst in seven months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts have attributed previous months' strong export performance to factory owners slashing prices to find buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission last week saw its motion to impose additional duties on electric vehicles built in China of up to 45 percent pass in a divided vote of EU member states, joining the US and Canada in tightening trade measures against China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's overall trade surplus narrowed to US$81.71 billion in September from US$91.02 billion in August and missed a forecast of US$89.80 billion. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street finished higher on Monday ahead of a slew of high-profile corporate earnings, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 to fresh records.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 percent at 5,859.85, while the Dow ended the day up 0.5 at 43,065.22 -- the first time it has closed above 43,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 percent to finish the day at 18,502.69, spurred by a 2.4 percent increase in the share price of chipmaker Nvidia, which closed at a new high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The market "just continues to sort of squeeze higher, led by primarily the mega cap stocks," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You have a market that clearly is continuing to show no signs of breaking here," he added. "And that, I think, is kind of keeping people fearful about missing out on further gains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elsewhere on Wall Street, McDonald's and UnitedHealth Group finished up 1.6 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traders are eying a busy week of earnings results ahead from US companies including Netflix, Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Australia took aim at firms charging consumers for tap or bankcard payments on Tuesday, targeting "hefty" fees in a billion-dollar industry dominated by Visa and Mastercard.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's centre-left government said it would "ban debit card surcharges" from 2026 and work to lower the cost of other types of electronic payments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australians now use cash for less than 16 percent of transactions, spelling boom times for electronic payment providers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They take a cut of almost every transaction, charging retailers a fee of between one and two percent to run each payment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia's central bank estimates merchants paid more than US$4 billion in transaction fees from 2022-2023 alone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many small shops pass along these costs to the consumer. But some larger companies – such as global retail chains – are often able to negotiate substantial discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have said it was determined to bring costs down and to stop small vendors from being gouged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Consumers shouldn't be punished for using cards or digital payments, and at the same time, small businesses shouldn't have to pay hefty fees just to get paid themselves," said economy minister Jim Chalmers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the United States, Visa and Mastercard this year agreed to limit transaction fees and pay US$30 billion to end an anti-trust investigation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A court has since threatened to reject that deal as overgenerous to Visa and Mastercard. The European Union has longstanding caps on fees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Credit and debit card companies have previously warned that regulation would mean less competitive markets and only mask the cost for consumers. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors assessed a series of earnings reports, and with chipmaker equities weakening on news the United States may introduce export curbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones slumped 0.8 percent to 42,740, as did the S&P 500 to 5,815.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq retreated 1.0 percent to 18,315.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks saw a mixed performance at the start of the day, with traders responding mostly positively to earnings reports, but eventually they lost ground.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chipmakers in particular struggled as markets reacted to reports that President Joe Biden's administration was considering a cap on exports of advanced AI chips to some countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dutch tech giant ASML, which supplies chip-making machines to the semiconductor industry, also saw its shares dive in Europe after unveiling a cut to its 2025 guidance and seeing a disappointing slump in sales bookings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The selloff is because of ASML suggesting that demand is not as strong" as anticipated for chips and AI, said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "ASML mentioned that demand is down from China. That's one of the biggest markets. There's chatter that the US government could start perhaps curbing chip sales even more," Krosby added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, ASML shares plunged 16.3 percent in the United States, while chip titan Nvidia lost 4.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   AMD, another major chip company, was down 5.2 percent. (AFP)

      Trump's crypto platform falters on first day of sales

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former US president Donald Trump's cryptocurrency platform had a faltering sales launch on Tuesday, with only a fraction of its digital tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Republican candidate announced in mid-September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch the platform named World Liberty Financial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 20 billion digital tokens, priced at 1.5 cents each, were offered by the company – a total value of US$300 million – but just three percent had been purchased by Tuesday evening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tokens can be used as cryptocurrencies and give buyers a vote on the platform's governance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many observers blamed the low sales on technical problems, as the company's website suffered outages earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World Liberty Financial will enable users to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies to or from one another, a service already offered by many platforms, one of the best-known of which is Aave.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, presenting himself as a "pro-bitcoin president" if elected in November. (AFP)

   US stocks bounced back on Wednesday after retreating a day prior, while earnings season was off to a relatively positive start.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones gained 0.8 percent to 43,077, while the S&P 500 Index added 0.5 percent to 5,842.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq advanced 0.3 percent, closing at 18,367.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks picked up towards the end of the day as investors sought to "buy the dip," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Also, the nuclear stocks are going crazy on the Amazon announcement," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tech giant Amazon announced significant investments in nuclear energy on Wednesday, joining other major companies in aiming to meet the high electric power demands of artificial intelligence using atomic energy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its shares closed 0.4 percent lower.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among companies that reported financial results this week, Morgan Stanley beat estimates with its third quarter report on Wednesday – after quarterly results from Goldman Sachs showed a jump in profits a day earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick said the bank saw a "strong third quarter in a constructive environment," and its shares closed 6.5 percent up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is "not a lot of conviction after yesterday's chipmaker-led declines," noted Briefing.com on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dutch tech giant ASML saw its shares plunge after it unveiled a cut to its 2025 guidance and slump in sales bookings, sending share prices of other firms falling on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Nvidia recovered some ground on Wednesday, with its shares up 3.1 percent, ASML and AMD both logged declines still. (AFP)

      China boosts credit to shore up property market

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China said on Thursday it would boost the credit available to the ailing property market and help renovate a million homes as it unveiled another round of measures to shore up the sector and try to reignite the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said Beijing would expand a "white list" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to four trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million "urban villages" to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled would help absorb existing housing inventories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilising a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021 and has acted as a drag on growth in the world's second largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun," Ni told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In January, China announced a plan for a "white list" of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly 1.4 trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Approved loans for the "white list" projects had risen to 2.23 trillion yuan as of October 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15 percent for all buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rate cuts helped households save 150 billion yuan, she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   TSMC, the dominant producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, reported on Thursday a forecast-beating 54 percent jump in third-quarter profit on the back of soaring demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards AI across a spectrum of industries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC posted a net profit of T$325.3 billion (US$10.11 billion) for the quarter which ended September 30, compared with the T$300.2 billion predicted by analysts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said third-quarter revenue rose 36 percent year-on-year to US$23.5 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of up to US$23.2 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC is spending billions of dollars building new factories in other parts of the world, including US$65 billion on three plants in the US state of Arizona.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On its last earnings call in July, TSMC raised its full-year revenue forecast and adjusted its capital expenditure plans for this year to between US$30 billion and US$32 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The AI boom has helped drive up TSMC shares, with its Taipei-listed stock leaping 75 percent so far this year, compared with a 28 percent gain for the broader market, giving it a market capitalisation of around US$840 billion. (Reuters)
