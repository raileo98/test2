<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Tuesday as traders responded positively to cooler-than-expected producer inflation data, bolstering expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.1 percent in July, down slightly from a month earlier, the Labour Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data will likely be well-received by the Federal Reserve as it weighs the right time to begin cutting interest rates from their current 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices on Wall Street finished higher on Wednesday, led by the Nasdaq, which closed up 2.4 percent at 17,187.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished 1.0 percent higher at 39,765, and the S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent to 5,434.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trend in inflation is leading in the right direction, and today was good news," said Tom Cahill, from Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That suggests that the Fed will very likely cut the rates" in September, he added,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual firms, coffee giant Starbucks closed 24.5 percent higher after it named Chipotle chief executive Brian Niccol as its new CEO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the good news for Starbucks was bad news for Chipotle, whose shares closed down 7.5 percent following the news of Niccol's departure. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wholesale price increases in the United States eased in July, suggesting that inflation pressures are further cooling. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766045_1_20240813212653.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wholesale price increases in the United States eased in July, suggesting that inflation pressures were cooling further as the Federal Reserve moves closer to cutting interest rates, likely beginning next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that its producer price index — which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers — rose 0.1 percent from June to July and 2.2 percent from a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to fluctuate from month to month, so-called core wholesale prices were unchanged from June and up 2.4 percent from July 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases were milder than forecasters had expected and were nearly consistent with the Fed's two percent inflation target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index can provide an early sign of where consumer inflation is headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Labor Department will release the most well-known inflation measure, the consumer price index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters have estimated that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent from June to July, after actually falling 0.1 percent the previous month, and three percent from July 2023, according to a survey by the data firm FactSet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation has plummeted since peaking at a four-decade high in mid-2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as Americans prepare to vote in the November presidential election, many remain unhappy with consumer prices, which are nearly 19 percent higher than were before the inflationary surge began in the spring of 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have assigned blame to US President Joe Biden, though it's unclear whether they will hold Vice President Kamala Harris responsible as she seeks the presidency. (AP)

    'High interest rates weigh on SMEs confidence'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Senior Standard Chartered economist Kelvin Lau (right) says lingering global uncertainties have affected SME business confidence. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766023_1_20240813172255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Productivity Council on Tuesday warned that a high interest rate environment is putting pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with business confidence among SMEs dropping to the lowest point in two years
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a quarterly survey conducted by the council in July, 56 percent of the 814 local businesses interviewed said high interest rates had affected consumer spending, with the most affected industries being retail, accommodation and food services and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, about one-third of the SMEs interviewed said they had a cash flow or supply chain problem because of the high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said business sentiment among SMEs remained cautious, with the latest Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index recording a decline in confidence to 42.5 points, dropping from 47.3 in the previous quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief innovation officer Lawrence Cheung said 10 of the 11 industries involved in the survey had shown a drop in confidence, with real estate having the lowest score. He said that indicated both external and domestic-oriented sectors were under-performing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Standard Chartered senior economist Kelvin Lau said the survey indicated a lack of confidence among SMEs over the global economic outlook due to external uncertainties lingering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Number one is the possibility of [Donald] Trump coming into office after the US elections in November. And the other being China's recent macro data weakness following its slightly weaker than expected Q2 GDP [growth], which came in at 4.7 percent rather than anything closer to 5 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So overall, it's kind of like a double whammy that the local businesses need to worry about the US and they need to worry about China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he added there are certain bright spots, citing expectations the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates from September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our own view is that we could see a collective 75 basis points of cuts between now and the year-end and possibly even more cuts in the first half of next year, to as much as 125 basis points in total,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So that would hopefully be a lot of relief to the Hong Kong SMEs, in particular the real estate sector, for example, and to some extent the accommodation and food services sector as well.”

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Investors are eyeing a report on the consumer price index – a key inflation gauge – due out on Wednesday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765932_1_20240813051023.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Results on Wall Street were mixed on Monday, with markets in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the release of US inflation data this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.4 percent to 39,357, while the S&P 500 was flat at 5,344.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq gained 0.2 percent to 16,780.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is another one of these watch-and-wait days," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The volume is not very high," he added, while noting the week ahead would be "busy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In particular, investors are eyeing a report on the consumer price index – a key inflation gauge – due out on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This "should have some effect on how we view the battle against inflation," Sosnick added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to start lowering interest rates at its meeting in September, although a weaker than expected labour market report at the start of this month fanned fears surrounding the US economy's health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are monitoring to see if inflation is cooling at a gradual pace – signalling the world's biggest economy is indeed achieving a "soft landing" where price increases ease without a downturn.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog on Sunday that Hong Kong should integrate further with China's national development and contribute to modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan said that the Third Plenary Session held in Beijing last month passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform and Promoting Chinese-style Modernization," which outlines Hong Kong's strategic positioning in leveraging the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, enhances the city's status as an international hub, and supports Hong Kong's bid in gathering top international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an international financial centre, Chan said that Hong Kong should fulfil its role as an offshore RMB business hub, focusing on shipping centre development, smart shipping, and green shipping, to make Hong Kong a "cross-border supply chain management centre" that provides one-stop support for mainland enterprises in expanding their production capacity and supply chain layout overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said this will generate new trade service demands and attract greater opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the SAR government is also recruiting talent and has launched a series of initiatives like the Top Talent Pass Scheme that supports talent development, to attract more top international talent to the region.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US inflation remains "uncomfortably" above the Federal Reserve's target despite the progress it has made in recent months, a senior bank official said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank has held interest rates at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent following a pandemic-era surge in prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed's favoured inflation gauge now sits at an annual rate of just 2.5 percent – well below the peak reached in 2022 – while the US economy is still growing and the labour market has weakened somewhat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against this backdrop, Fed chair Jerome Powell suggested in late July that the bank could move ahead with its first interest rate cut as soon as September – if economic data continues to come in as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some Fed officials have been more cautious about signalling rate cuts than others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The progress in lowering inflation during May and June is a welcome development," Fed governor Michelle Bowman told a conference in Colorado Springs, according to prepared remarks. "But inflation is still uncomfortably above the committee's two percent goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite "upside risks," Bowman said she still expects inflation to ease in the coming months, but warned policymakers to remain patient "and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to a single data point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The remarks from Bowman, who is a permanent voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, suggest she remains concerned about cutting interest rates too soon – despite overwhelming support for a September rate cut in the financial markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures traders are now wholly convinced that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September, and are instead split over how big its first cut will be, according to data from CME Group. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended higher on Friday after a tumultuous week in which markets clawed their way back from Monday's steep dive that was prompted by fears of a recession and unwinding of a global yen-funded carry trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to end at 5,344, the Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.5 percent to 16,745. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 percent to 39,497.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology sector led gains in the index for the day, while the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's "fear gauge", was down on Friday after surging to 65.73 at the start of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Fed policymakers expressed confidence that inflation was cooling enough to allow interest-rate cuts ahead, and will take their cues on the size and timing of those cuts from the economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's big decline followed a sharp sell-off last week as a weaker-than-expected July jobs report sparked recession fears, and the Bank of Japan's decision to hike interest rates on July 31 led to a sharp appreciation in the yen. That resulted in the unwinding of currency carry trade positions in which the yen is used to buy high-yielding assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For most of the last week the negative opinions were driving sentiment and direction and those have been outweighed by a little less pessimism," in recent days, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he said, "there is going to continue to be a significant amount of uncertainty and anxiety hanging over the market for the course of the next month until we get to the next Fed meeting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors see a 55 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on September 17-18, with a 25 basis point cut seen as having a 45 percent probability, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors also await next week's readings on US consumer prices and retail sales for July, which could provide fresh evidence on the chances of a soft landing for the American economy. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street bounced back, with all three major indices ending the session higher. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765409_1_20240809043424.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Thursday in Wall Street’s latest sharp swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries about the slowing economy .
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 jumped 119.81 points, or 2.3 percent, to 5,319.31, for its best day since 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683.04 points, or 1.8 percent to 39,446.49, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 464.22 points, or 2.9 percent to 16,660.02.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A week ago worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims fuelled worries that the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates at too high for too long. That sent markets reeling, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that hit the carry trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down about 9 percent from its all-time set last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the market’s swings look more like a “positioning-driven crash” caused by too many investors piling into similar trades and then exiting them together, rather than the start of a long-term downward market caused by a recession, according to strategists at BNP Paribas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say it looks more similar to the “flash crash” of 2010 than the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 recession caused by the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course, markets have been quick to turn over the past week regardless of any long-term predictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Today’s jobless claims data may ease some of the concerns raised by last week’s soft jobs report,” said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. “But with inflation data due out next week and the stock market still working through its biggest pullback of the year, it’s unclear how much this will move the sentiment needle.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the meantime, big US companies continue to turn in profit reports for the spring that are mostly better than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Big Tech stocks also rose to claw back some of their sharp losses from the last month. (AP)

    Apple says it's falling into line with new EU rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The EU is also investigating Apple over changes previously made to comply with new European digital laws by allowing third-party app stores. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765399_1_20240809022302.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday announced changes to its App Store after the European Union accused the iPhone maker of breaking the bloc's landmark new digital rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU said the App Store terms prevented app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative ways to pay, making Apple the first ever tech firm to face accusations of breaching a new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now Apple says there will be changes to comply with the DMA and address the findings of the European Commission, the EU's powerful antitrust regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels at the time said developers could only steer customers through a link in their app that redirected the user to a web page to conclude any contracts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regulators said Apple placed "several restrictions" meaning app developers could not communicate, promote offers and conclude contracts through the channel of their choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the autumn, Apple said developers in the EU "can communicate and promote offers for purchases" wherever they want, for example, via an alternative app marketplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in Thursday's announcement, Apple said the changes mean developers will have a new fee structure for customers linking out of an app for offers and content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For instance, developers will have to pay a five-percent fee on sales of digital goods and services made on any platforms within a year of a user first installing an app with the ability to link out to a different channel such as a website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the big tech firms modify their platforms in accordance with EU rules, they can avoid large penalties. The DMA demands the EU wrap up any probe within a year of its start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission told AFP it "will assess Apple's eventual changes to the compliance measures, also taking into account any feedback from the market, notably developers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges against Apple came after the commission launched investigations in March into Apple, Facebook owner Meta and Google under the DMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta also faced formal accusations of violating the DMA in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DMA gives big tech a list of what they can and can't do in business in a bid to increase competition in the digital sphere. For example, they must offer choice screens for web browsers and search engines to give users more options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law gives the EU the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. This can rise to up to 20 percent for repeat offenders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also faces daily penalties of up to five percent of its average daily worldwide turnover if found to be non-compliant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Coalition for App Fairness, whose members include Swedish streaming giant Spotify and which has long called for Apple to open up its marketplace, dismissed the latest Apple announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the introduction of yet another confusing, arbitrary, and expensive fee structure, Apple continues to evade compliance and make the digital landscape in Europe more complicated for developers and more costly for consumers," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU is also investigating Apple over changes previously made to comply with the DMA by allowing third-party app stores. (AFP)

    FTX ordered to pay customers almost US$13bn

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A US court has ordered bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX to pay US$12.7 billion in relief to its customers, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  FTX drew customers in with "an illusion that it was a safe and secure place to access crypto markets," then misappropriated their customer deposits to make its own risky investments, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The repayment order implements a settlement between the CFTC and the bankrupt crypto exchange, which has committed to a bankruptcy liquidation that will repay customers whose deposits were locked during its late 2022 collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX has said its customers will receive 100 percent recovery on their claims against the company, based on the value of their accounts at the time it filed for bankruptcy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CFTC agreement resolves a potential roadblock to that repayment, ensuring that the government's lawsuit against FTX will not reduce the funds available to its customers. The CFTC agreed not to collect any payment from FTX until all its customers are repaid, with interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CFTC settlement requires FTX to pay US$8.7 billion in restitution and US$4 billion in disgorgement, which will be used to further compensate victims for losses suffered during the exchange's collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for stealing US$8 billion from customers. He has appealed the conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX has used its bankruptcy to reach settlements with US regulators and former business partners and to sell assets that had been purchased with misappropriated customer funds, including real estate and investments in crypto and other tech companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX is currently soliciting votes on its bankruptcy proposal but faces opposition from some customers who feel short-changed by the decision to repay them based on much-lower cryptocurrency prices from November 2022. Votes are due on August 16, and FTX intends to seek final approval of its wind-down plan on October 7. (Reuters)

 Wall Street finished lower on Wednesday after an early rally petered out, in a sign of lingering unease after recent equity market weakness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is what happens when you have a big risk-off type of event," Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers, said of Monday's equity market plunge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's normal to see the market display uncertainty," said Sosnick, who pointed to a poorly received US Treasury bond auction as further evidence of investor angst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 38,763.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,199, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.1 percent to 16,195.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices sank more than 2.5 percent on Monday amid worries over a potential US recession and the unwinding of the so-called "carry trade" that took advantage of the weak yen prior to last week's interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many analysts expect more effects from the unwinding, extending a period of volatility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney fell 4.5 percent despite reporting better than expected earnings as investors digested commentary that a weakening of demand in the parks business "could impact the next few quarters."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airbnb slumped 13.4 percent after reporting lower than expected profits and cautioning of "some signs of slowing demand from US guests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TripAdvisor also fell sharply after earnings, tumbling 16.7 percent. (AFP)

    Cathay declares interim dividend despite profit drop

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cathay Pacific says it will buy 30 Airbus wide-body aircraft with an option to purchase another 30. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765141_1_20240807130622.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Wednesday announced an interim dividend due to its strong performance in the first six months of 2024, despite reporting a drop in first-half profit from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm added that a decrease in profit for its airlines and subsidiaries was "principally attributable to the normalisation of ticket prices".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group recorded a 14 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our strong performance for the first six months of the year was primarily driven by the ongoing robust demand for travel, and the solid performance of our cargo business," said the airline's chairman Patrick Healy in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This result has allowed us to announce a first interim dividend payment to ordinary shareholders of HK$0.20 per ordinary share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay's budget arm, HK Express, reported a loss of HK$73 million in the first half of the year, following earnings of HK$333 million in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Lam said the low-cost carrier had been facing engine issues and regional competition, but he remained confident in the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of those aircraft are on ground and not being able to generate revenue for HK Express in the short term," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second issue HK Express is facing short-term, is the very keen competition among short-haul carriers based in Hong Kong, as well as the foreign low-cost carriers flying into Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Healy said the company is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic flight levels within the first quarter of 2025 as it enters "the final stretch" of its rebuilding journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are increasing our group headcount by 5,000 to a total of 29,000 people by the end of this year to support this pace of growth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline had also bought back HK$19.5 billion in preference shares acquired by the government as part of a bailout package to stay afloat, and said it would continue to maintain a lower level of liquidity than it did during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of its fleet, Cathay said it would buy 30 Airbus A330-900 wide-body aircraft, with an option to purchase 30 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not disclose the purchase price but said it received "significant price concessions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The basic price is about US$11 billion, or roughly HK$85.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These new regional wide-body aircraft are expected to be delivered from 2028 and will join the Cathay Pacific fleet, principally serving destinations in Asia. We now have more than 100 new-generation aircraft in our delivery pipeline, with the rights to acquire 80 additional aircraft in future," Healy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The purchase of Airbus aircraft is part of an investment drive of more than HK$100 billion over the next seven years, which also includes newly designed lounges and cabin products.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Growth in China's exports slowed last month while imports returned to the black, customs data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Exports were up 7 percent in July year on year after posting an 8.6 percent increase the month before, the strongest rise in 15 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's figure was the weakest since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of the year taken together, exports rose 6.7 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, rose at a robust 7.2 percent last month, compared with a 2.3 percent contraction in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's imports growth was the fastest in three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports climbed 5.4 percent in the January-July period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus narrowed to US$84.65 billion in July from US$99.05 billion in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, the trade surplus expanded by 7.9 percent year on year to US$518 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns remained for the world's second-largest economy after second-quarter GDP growth slowed to 4.7 percent from 5.3 percent in the January-March period, keeping alive calls for policymakers to roll out more support to reach the government's full-year growth target of around 5 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong market opened stronger on Wednesday, taking its cue from Wall Street, which partially rebounded from a sell-off in the previous session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index was up 37.44 points, or 0.22 percent, at 16,684.78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the United States, investors returned to the market after soothing comments by Federal Reserve officials eased US recession worries, with the S&P and the Nasdaq both gaining more than one percent, and the Dow rising 0.8 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rebounded on Tuesday after three straight days of losses, with analysts pointing to bargain hunting and US bond markets bouncing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gains in New York also followed a quieter day in most overseas stock markets and came as Caterpillar and Uber reported solid earnings, lifting shares of both companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm hopeful that we'll get some stability back," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that there could still be "a little more downside risks to the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.8 percent at 38,997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,240, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 1.0 percent to 16,366.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices fell more than 2.5 percent on Monday in a move seen as a reflection of worries about a US recession following Friday's disappointing jobs data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market watchers have also pointed to ripple effects from Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and have led to liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei, which slumped 12.4 percent on Monday, jumped 10.2 percent on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reversal in the US equity market came as US Treasury bond yields climbed and as a closely-watched volatility index retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Caterpillar gained 3.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as strong pricing offset the hit from lower revenues. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered a bruising rout on Monday, extending a pullback attributed to economic unease and fallout from recent lurches in overseas financial markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major indices spent the entire day in the red, with the Dow Jones losing 2.6 percent, or more than 1,000 points, to finish at 38,703.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 3.0 percent to end at 5,186, while the Nasdaq dropped 3.4 percent to 16,200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses followed down days last Thursday and Friday on the heels of poor US employment data and a negative survey from manufacturers that sparked worries about a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seizing on that point, some market watchers have called for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – perhaps even in an emergency meeting – after the central bank kept rates unchanged last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But market watchers are also focusing on the ripple effects of Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and slammed Japan's Nikkei equity market, which dove 12.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an abrupt move in a market that has a lot of tentacles," Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said of the Japan currency shift, which is believed to have led to speedy liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan believes the Japan currency movements are much more a factor in the turbulence than recession fears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survey results of services companies by the Institute for Supply Management showed stronger than expected growth, boosting US Treasury bond yields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts at High Frequency Economics called the report "a refreshingly stronger-than-expected outcome" that helps to counter the gloom from last week's economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether it will turn around the US equity sell-off is to be determined, of course," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet dropped 4.6 percent after a US judge sided with antitrust officials who had alleged that the company operated a monopoly with its dominant search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also had a bad day, losing 4.8 percent on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had cut its stake in the tech giant. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bank of China (Hong Kong) said the outlook for the SAR and mainland economies is positive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said the local economy is seeing a stable recovery, with strong inbound tourist figures and low unemployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also said retail sales remained weak and housing prices could drop "by a small margin" this year.

  On the world's second-largest economy, the bank believes it will reach its 5 percent growth target for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still believe that the growth rate in China will eventually translate to the growth rate in China's enterprise sector, I mean all the corporates in China," said Ding Meng, senior economist of Bank of China (Hong Kong).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we are anticipating the improvement of the profits prospect in China-related investments, so we are kind of positive for the stock market here in Hong Kong and also in mainland China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank also said it expects the US Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September or December this year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says hot weather led to increased electricity demand. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764812_1_20240805153704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday announced a mid-year net profit of HK$5.95 billion, a near 18 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company said Hong Kong’s accelerated economic recovery, along with hotter weather, led to increased electricity demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Australian and Indian business also improved, offsetting the impact of reduced electricity generation at its nuclear power plants on the mainland due to scheduled maintenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP also pointed to various renewable energy projects on the mainland, saying they will be the key drivers for its profit in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s revenue rose to HK$44.09 billion, an almost 2 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.63 per share, matching the first interim dividend of the year and unchanged from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have always been generating revenue and dividends for the benefit of our shareholders. And we adopt a policy to have a reliable and consistent dividend with steady growth supported by sustainable business development,” said CLP's chief executive officer TK Chiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we will continue to grow the business and if the condition approves, of course, we will try to adjust our dividend. But at the end of the day, the dividend will be approved by the board.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiang also said any further reduction in prices for consumers in the remainder of the year will depend on the international fuel market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because of the continued easing of the energy prices globally, we saw tariff reduction. From January up to August, the tariff for CLP's customers in Hong Kong saw a reduction of about 2 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the remaining part of the year, it will really depend on the international fuel price trend. If the fuel price continues to follow the current trend, there could be an opportunity for further adjustments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about progress in reviewing its power management system following several voltage dips this year, Chiang said the company is working on solutions to minimise the impact such incidents have on customers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff, driven by last week's plunge in global stock markets, economic concerns and worries investments funded by a cheap yen were being unwound.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei share average shed a staggering 12.4 percent as Friday's dismal US jobs data heightened worries of a possible recession, and as the yen rallied to seven-month highs versus the US dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27 percent drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the close on Monday, the index closed at 31,458.42 and had wiped out 113 trillion yen (US$792.32 billion) of that peak market value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks," said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after a soft jobs report stoked fears of an oncoming recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the US economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike," said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yen was last up 2.5 percent at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14 percent in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The banking sector slumped 17 percent to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broader Topix fell 12.2 percent to 2,227.15. (Reuters)

    Cathay to increase flights to Phnom Penh

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Saturday announced it will offer daily flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh from October 27, up from the current five trips per week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came after the CEO of the SAR's flag carrier, Ronald Lam, signed an agreement to boost its partnership with Cambodia Airports during Chief Executive John Lee's recent six-day Asean trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision is also part of Cathay's plan to prepare for the completion of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group emphasised that it will continue to strengthen its existing routes, as well as expand its network and collaboration with Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, this year marks the 75th anniversary since Cathay operated its inaugural flight to Vietnam. The airline announced that it will kick off another round of recruitment in the country this month, after welcoming more than 170 Vietnamese flight attendants earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And low-cost airline Hong Kong Express, which is owned by Cathay, is planning to start flights between Hong Kong and Phu Quoc – a Vietnamese island – in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay currently flies to 17 Asean destinations, with over 360 flights per week.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street took a dive on Friday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764530_1_20240803044225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday following a disappointing US jobs report that raised recession worries while also boosting the odds of interest rate cuts by the Fed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy added 114,000 jobs last month, a drop from the prior month and fewer than expected, while the jobless rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest level since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report added to recession fears following lacklustre manufacturing data on Thursday, with losses in the week's final two days leaving all three major indices down for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 39,737, down 1.5 percent for the day and 2.1 percent for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 fell 1.8 percent to 5,346, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.4 percent to 16,776.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Historically it's very difficult to achieve a soft landing," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. "It's easy for a soft landing to sneak up on you and become a hard landing. And that's what the market is very much afraid of right now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said the market is likely overreacting to a few weak data points, noting that most of the corporate earnings released in the last few weeks have been solid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are ready to shoot first and ask questions later," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Intel shares sank more than 26 percent after the US chip maker announced it would cut more than 15 percent of its workforce while reporting a US$1.6 billion quarterly loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon also had a bad day, losing nearly nine percent on worries about the tech giant's profit outlook after revenues fell short of expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Apple advanced 0.7 percent after reporting quarterly profit of US$21.4 billion, besting analyst forecasts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coca-Cola rose 2.0 percent as it announced plans to pay a tax penalty worth US$6 billion while it pursues an appeal in a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soft drinks giant had previously said the dispute could potentially involve a liability of US$16 billion. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data shows US unemployment edging up to 4.3 percent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764508_1_20240803000230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with sustained higher interest rates taking a toll on businesses and consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Friday’s report from the US Labor Department showed that employers added just 114,000 jobs in July – 35 percent fewer than forecasters had expected – and that unemployment, now up to 4.3 percent, was the highest since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Things are deteriorating quickly,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news shook financial markets around the world, with the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq both dropping sharply at the open of trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sturdiness of the US economy — the world’s largest — has been a key driver of global economic growth and the US jobs market is a big reason for it, underpinning the American expansion and giving consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unemployment rate's jump to 4.3 percent in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signalled that the United States is in recession — though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the topsy-turvy post-pandemic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weak jobs report came two days after the Federal Reserve said it would hold off on cutting interest rates until it sees more evidence that inflation is continuing to move down and closer to its 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterised the American job market as healthy, despite growing calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high, to pre-empt a major weakening of the US economy and job market. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index on Friday was down about 1.4 percent, or 240 points, in early trading at 17,064.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sell-off came after Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday following weak manufacturing data, sparking worries about a US recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, European stocks had slumped on disappointing bank earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US indices finished decisively lower, with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index falling the most at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets will get another key US economic data point on Friday with monthly jobs data. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

    Wall Street ends down on jitters over manufacturing

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks kicked off August sharply lower after a round of economic data on Thursday spurred concerns the economy may be slowing faster than anticipated while the Federal Reserve maintains a restrictive monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities initially opened higher, partly lifted by Meta Platforms after its quarterly results topped expectations and the Facebook parent issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the early gains evaporated after data showed a measure of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) dropped to an eight-month low in July at 46.8, signifying contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What you’re seeing now, and you will probably see it for the next month or two, is some kind of consolidation and sideways price action," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bigger picture bull trend is intact ... But we're in a period now where the market is kind of digesting its gains sideways, back and forth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 lost 75.62 points, or 1.4 percent, to end at 5,446.68, the Nasdaq Composite lost 405.26 points, or 2 .3 percent, to 17,194.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 494.82 points, or 1.2 percent, to 40,347.97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  August is typically one of the weakest months of the year for stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other data showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labour market, although seasonal factors also played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will eye government payroll data later on Friday for signs of further weakness in the labour market. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of England on Thursday cut its main interest rate for the first time since the pandemic broke out in 2020, as British inflation has retreated in recent months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight 5-4 vote, BoE policymakers agreed to reduce borrowing costs by a quarter-point to 5.0 percent, the central bank announced following a regular meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Andrew Bailey joined four other policymakers in bringing the rate down from a 16-year high, which will ease pressure on borrowers while denting interest earned by savers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail banks tend to mirror the direction of BoE policy when setting their own interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Inflationary pressures have eased enough that we've been able to cut interest rates," Bailey said in a short statement. "But we need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's annual inflation rate has returned to the BoE target of two percent, after soaring to a four-decade high above 11 percent in late 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its key lending rate unchanged, but noted "some further progress" had been made in bringing inflation down. It is expected to cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the BoE's action Thursday, analysts said they expected the British central bank to cut again this year, but maybe not as early as next month. That helped the pound claw back earlier losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, the European Central Bank has started to trim rates as gains to prices of global goods and services have largely slowed in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, the Bank of Japan on Wednesday hiked borrowing costs for only the second time in 17 years amid a pickup in the country's inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's rate cut comes less than one month after the country elected a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour administration has vowed to grow the UK economy but has already warned that state spending will be hampered by tight finances. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 9.7 percent to HK$29.9 billion in June, government data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, total retail sales were down 6.6 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman attributed the decline to changing consumer behaviour among both visitors and residents, as well as the strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said the rate of decline narrowed further in June, signalling a stabilisation in retail activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the spokesman pointed to ongoing challenges for the sector in the near term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said central government initiatives benefiting Hong Kong and the SAR government's efforts to support the retail sector through mega-events would help retailers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will actively expand domestic demand and put consumption promotion at a more prominent position in the next step, Yuan Da, a senior official with the National Development and Reform Commission, told a press conference on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The state planner will launch efforts to boost consumption of major commodities such as automobiles and home appliances, and to improve and expand the quality and capacity of service consumption in education, elderly care, child care and domestic services, Yuan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support will be given to the high-quality development of cultural and sports tourism, Yuan said, adding that measures will be optimised to make travel in China more convenient and comfortable for foreign visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also expressed confidence that China will achieve its full-year economic growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is "sufficient" room for counter-cyclical policy adjustments, said Zhao Chenxin, vice head of the state planner. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday kept its base rate at 5.75 percent, after the US Federal Reserve ended a two-day meeting leaving its key rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the first interest rate cut could come as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said “inflation pressure in the US has somewhat abated lately, and the market expects that the easing cycle might begin soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it added that the pace of any easing remains uncertain, and said the interbank offered rate in Hong Kong might stay high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said in a statement.

 The Hang Seng Index fell 16.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to open at 17,327.85 points on Thursday, following its 2 percent rise on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.

  Overnight, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates could be cut as soon as September if the US economy follows its expected path, putting the central bank near the end of a more than two-year battle against inflation. The Fed ended its latest two-day policy meeting with a decision to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the 5.25-5.50 percent range that was set a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it was keeping its base rate at 5.75 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could cut interest rates as soon as September, with technology shares leading the way.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Fed delivered what the markets anticipated in terms of opening the door to a rate cut in September without overcommitting," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major US indices spent almost the entire day in positive territory, hitting peaks during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference before edging down a bit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index led major indices, winning 2.6 percent to finish at 17,599.40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 percent to 40,842.79, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.6 percent to 5,522.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain interest rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Powell told a news conference that the first interest rate cut could come "as soon as" the Fed's next rate meeting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is beginning to feel more comfortable that inflation is beginning to come down," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Capital. "The Fed feels that it can finally get control of inflation, there is a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductor shares enjoyed a buoyant session, with artificial intelligence player Nvidia rocketing up 12.8 percent and Broadcom and Micron also advancing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing gained 2.1 percent despite reporting a bigger than expected loss as the troubled aviation company named Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO. The appointment won praise from analysts who said Ortberg's extensive aerospace experience would bolster a turnaround.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft fell 1.1 percent despite reporting a 10 percent jump in quarterly profit to US$22 billion. Analysts said a crucial cloud computing unit did not grow as strongly as expected. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve left its key lending rate unchanged again on Wednesday and said it had made "some further progress" in its inflation fight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the US central bank's benchmark interest rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement -- keeping rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a small uptick in inflation earlier this year, recent data suggest the Fed's mission of bringing inflation back down to its long-term target of 2 percent is now firmly back on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its favoured measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labour market has come into better balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective," the Fed said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks a slight change in tone from its decision in June, when it noted only that "modest further progress" had been made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance," the Fed said, adding that it was "attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But since then, the official figures have painted a better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 60 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cuts are expected to come in the form of three separate quarter-point moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favouritism towards the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November. (AFP)

    Boeing names new boss, unveils hefty loss

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing named former Rockwell Collins chief Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO on Wednesday, as the planemaker reported a loss on continued operational problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ortberg, 64, helped lead Rockwell Collins and integrate it into United Technology prior to his retirement from RTX in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment comes as Boeing attempts to rebound from a series of safety and quality control problems that have sharpened scrutiny on the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg "is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry," said Boeing chairman Steve Mollenkopf in a message to employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg is set to become CEO on August 8, taking over for Dave Calhoun, a former General Electric and private equity executive who has held the post since early 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with Kelly as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in our long history," Mollenkopf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing on Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss of US$1.4 billion, compared with a loss of US$149 million in the year-ago period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenues fell 14.6 percent to US$16.9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterly results reflected a continued drag from Boeing's commercial division, where it has lowered production while addressing safety and quality control issues under the close watch of regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has been in the hot seat since a January incident in which a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest results also showed significant weakness in its defence business due to a number of fixed price contracts where it has experienced deep losses due to supply chain problems, as well as higher engineering costs and technical issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's press release listed four defence contracts behind an operating loss of US$913 million in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations," Calhoun said. "We are making important progress in our recovery and will continue to build trust through action and transparency." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official advance estimates released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compares with a revised 2.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed the second quarter growth to an increase in exports and investment spending, saying it expects the economy to continue to expand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year, but performance of the different economic segments may vary amid uncertainties on various fronts," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions, escalating trade conflicts, and US interest rate trajectory remaining not entirely clear may add uncertainties to economic sentiment and activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Natixis Asia Pacific economist Gary Ng said the figure for the second quarter was slightly higher than he expected, but pressures still remain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the other components, such as the contraction in the household spending and also the greater growth in the import of services, which is basically reflecting the outbound tourism and also the rebound in investment, which basically just get back to the pre-Covid level and is still 16 percent lower than 2018 for the same period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think these are all the sorts of pressures that I would see within the economy that can actually drag the growth rate further in the future."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Holdings on Wednesday said its first-half pre-tax profit came in at US$21.6 billion, a 0.5 percent decline compared to the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it will pay an interim dividend of 10 US cents per share, the second payment this year following the 31 US cents announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC also announced a further three-month repurchase of up to US$3 billion, following the completed US$3 billion buyback announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With several major central banks seen likely to cut interest rates later this year, the group's outgoing chief executive, Noel Quinn, told an online press call that HSBC has reduced its sensitivity to interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates. And this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we knew that interest rate declines were going to come at some stage, we've been investing heavily in building up alternative revenue growth options, mainly around wealth, international wholesale banking and international transaction banking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incumbent chief financial officer, Georges Elhedery, will step into the chief executive role in September following Quinn's retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery highlighted the bank's commitment to its core Hong Kong and UK markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bulk of our capital and resources are deployed in our four scale activities, that is Hong Kong, the UK, our international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities, and our wealth proposition, and that's in particular in Asia," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm intending to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, intending to continue improving operating leverage, while maintaining a very strong discipline which is now embedded in the firm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has named Jonathan Bingham as the interim group chief financial officer, effective from September 2.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The tech-rich Nasdaq tumbled again while the Dow forged higher on Tuesday as investors continued to steer funds away from artificial intelligence equities toward other sectors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing so-called "rotation" from tech giants to smaller and medium-sized company comes as some of the biggest tech companies are set to report quarterly results in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, noted that this buying trend may be almost over now that Microsoft, Nvidia and others have fallen significantly from their peaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 percent to 40,743.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.5 percent to 5,436, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.3 percent to 17,147.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft reported after the market closed on Tuesday, while Apple, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta will report over the next two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This rotation likely stops when we get the majority of these mega caps to report," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Procter & Gamble dropped 4.9 percent as it reported a seven percent fall in quarterly profits on flat sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowdstrike also plunged nearly 10 percent following reports Delta hired attorney David Boies to seek damages following an IT outage that threw the airline's operations into turmoil for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the deluge of corporate earnings, this week's calendar includes Wednesday's Fed decision, as well as monthly US employment data on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Monday following a choppy session to open a news-jammed week that includes major tech earnings and a Federal Reserve decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Investors are adopting a wait-and-see posture ahead of quarterly results from Microsoft, Apple and other tech giants, as well as a Wednesday Fed decision, analysts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but could hint at a rate cut at its next meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.1 percent at 40,539.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.1 percent at 5,463, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also won 0.1 percent at 17,370.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tech shares have been under pressure in recent weeks after leading the market for the first half of 2024, with investors shifting funds to other sectors due to concerns about excessive valuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, McDonald's gained 3.3 percent despite missing analyst estimates as the company vowed to redouble efforts to win over value-focused consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts noted the fast-food chain had fallen 17 percent prior to the results, suggesting the negative news was priced in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's agenda also includes a monthly US employment report for July. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's home prices have fallen to their lowest level in almost eight years, with analysts predicting a further slump in the property market due to high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Monday showed that private flat prices fell about 1.2 percent in June, pulling the official index down from 305.6 in May to 301.8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices also dropped for the second straight month, plunging to their lowest since September 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, senior director and head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said high interest rates and the inventory of unsold units will continue to affect the city's property market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still expect the prices to go down a little bit in the second half of the year. But the price drop will be narrowed, because people are expecting the US to cut the rates later this year, and it will increase the market confidence for some of the buyers... Across the whole year, the price drop will be about five percent," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents rose nearly 0.2 percent month-on-month in June to the highest level in four and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said he expects rents to continue to go up steadily, saying levels are being boosted by the arrival of overseas students and people moving to Hong Kong under talent admission schemes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks cheered a benign US inflation report on Friday, powering the market to a positive conclusion to the week despite weakness in tech shares in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report showed that the personal consumption expenditures price index eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in June, from 2.6 percent, amounting to progress in a key US Federal Reserve indicator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut interest rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones jumped 1.6 percent to 40,589.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 percent to 5,459, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.0 percent to 17,357.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Wednesday, led by a rout in tech shares, which have been seen as overvalued after strong gains in the first half of 2024. Despite the Nasdaq's bounce on Friday, the index finished the week down more than two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to have slowing inflation and solid growth," conditions "consistent with a soft landing thesis," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kourkafas expects more of a "rotation" away from technology to other sectors in the upcoming period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, 3M shot up around 23 percent after reporting better-than-expected earnings and lifting its full-year profit forecast. Analysts see the industrial heavyweight as well positioned following progress on major litigation issues that have dogged the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biogen dove 7.2 percent after announcing European officials gave a negative reading on a new Alzheimer's disease treatment. Biogen and partner Eisai said they would seek a reexamination of the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DexCom, which supplies glucose monitoring systems for diabetes, plunged more than 40 percent after lowering its sales forecast. (AFP)
