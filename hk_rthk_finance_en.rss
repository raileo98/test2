    Japan to list Tokyo Metro in autumn

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said Japan's national and Tokyo governments were seeking a 700 billion yen valuation for the Tokyo Metro as they prepare to list the subway operator as early as the end of October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  If the deal goes ahead, it would be Japan's biggest initial public offering (IPO) in roughly six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two governments, which own 100 percent of Tokyo Metro, plan to arrange a meeting of brokerages within a week for a briefing on the IPO and expect to receive approval for the listing from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as soon as mid-September, sources told the Reuters news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half the company to be sold, the IPO could raise 350 billion yen, which would exceed the size of Kokusai Electric's IPO last year and become the largest since SoftBank Group listed its wireless unit in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IPO follows the listing of other railway operators, including Kyushu Railway (JR Kyushu) in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo Metro runs 195 kilometres of lines carrying 6.5 million passengers daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo Metro's history dates back to 1920 with the establishment of the Tokyo Underground Railway Company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven years later, it opened Japan's first subway line, between the Asakusa and Ueno districts of Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company, whose business includes real estate and retail, reported net profit jumped by two-thirds to 46 billion yen in the financial year ended March 2024 as economic activity rebounded from the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central Japanese government, which owns 53.4 percent of Tokyo Metro, plans to use the funds raised to repay reconstruction bonds issued following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tokyo government holds the remaining 46.6 percent of the subway operator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nomura, Mizuho and Goldman Sachs are the joint global coordinators for the listing. (Reuters)

 The Hang Seng Index gained 139.5 points, or 0.8 percent, to open at 17,569.66 points on Monday after hopes for an economic soft landing powered US stocks higher last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Encouraging data relieved recession worries following a brutal sell-off earlier this month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD on Saturday announced plans to open a car production plant in Pakistan, where it will also start selling three models through a partnership with Mega Motors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BYD is the first major new electric vehicle entrant in the Pakistani market, where there is a lack of charging infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entry into the Pakistani market is not just about bringing advanced vehicles to consumers," said Liu Xueliang, BYD's general manager for Asia Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's about driving a broader vision of environmental responsibility and technological innovation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BYD also plans to open three "flagship stores and experience centres" in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, the company said at a launch event in Lahore, adding it plans to start selling two SUV models and a sedan from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mega Motors is a unit of Pakistan's largest private utility Hub Power Co Ltd, known as Hubco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will establish Pakistan's first NEV assembly plant... dedicated to producing BYD's cutting-edge new energy vehicles," said Hubco Chief Executive Kamran Kamal, who described the deal as a "landmark investment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new plant will begin operations in 2026, Kamal told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hubco will setup fast-charging stations across major cities, motorways and highways to enhance Pakistan's charging infrastructure. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Major Wall Street indices all closed higher on Friday, with investors increasingly confident of a rate cut next month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks shook off an early slump to close higher on Friday, ending a positive week for the major indices on Wall Street, as gold prices hit a record high.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We had very big moves over the past two weeks, off the low," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments. "And now we are only five percent below the all time high."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That shows us that there is still a lot of demand for stocks at lower prices," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.2 percent at 40,659.76, the S&P 500 finished 0.2 percent higher at 5,554.25 and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day 0.2 percent higher at 17,631.72.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gold hit a new record on Friday as investors snapped up the precious metal amid increasing confidence that US rates will fall in September, weakening the US dollar. Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also increased market appetite for safe haven investments like gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders are now looking ahead to Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes of its most recent interest rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also be closely scrutinizing comments from Fed officials around the Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers next weekend, according to Sarhan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You have expectations that the Fed is going to cut, the question now becomes how many times they will cut," he said. "Nobody knows, not even the Fed. It's data dependent once again." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gold hit a record high on Friday as global stock markets diverged, with profit-taking on Wall Street while European and Asian markets gained on reassuring data about the health of the world's biggest economy and likely US interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Expectations of US interest rate cuts weakened the dollar, while oil prices tumbled as weak Chinese demand expectations offset turmoil in the Middle East, according to traders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gold rose to a record high of US$2,500.16 an ounce as investors snapped up the haven investment in the face of an increasingly likely US interest rate cut in September and heightened geopolitical risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sharp drop in bond yields amid expectations of rate cuts by the Fed" have pushed gold prices higher, said City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's major indices dipped at the start of trading after rallying on Thursday following stronger-than-expected retail sales data that dispelled fears the US economy is heading for a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These aren't big moves at all relative to the gains that have preceded them, yet buyers aren't rushing in to buy the dip just yet knowing the market has come a long way in a short amount of time," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the S&P 500 is up more than eight percent from its August 5 low and the Nasdaq Composite has gained 12 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices slumped more than 1.5 percent, Brent North Sea crude falling under US$80 per barrel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The significant price recovery on the oil market has run out of steam in recent days," said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For one thing, the feared retaliatory strike by Iran (on Israel) has so far failed to materialise, which has probably favoured a partial pricing out of the risk premium. In addition, new demand concerns are weighing on the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major oil producer Iran has threatened to retaliate against Israel for last month's killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. (AFP)

    Job market remains stable for fifth straight month

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's labour market remains stable, with the unemployment rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive month. File photo: Xinhua" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766471_1_20240816172116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's job market remained steady, with the latest government data showing the unemployment rate at three percent between May and July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure has been unchanged since March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a government spokesperson warned the labour market could be under pressure in the short term, as changing spending habits of locals and visitors would dent consumption-related industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the jobless rate remained consistent, around 3,100 people still lost their jobs in July, joining more than 114,000 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, the labour force expanded by 8,400 to roughly 3.83 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weak domestic demand continued to weigh on consumption-related industries. The jobless rate for the retail sector worsened by 0.4 percent to 4.3 percent, while food and beverage industry hit five percent after going up three-tenths of a percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other sectors improved, notably trade and wholesale, accommodation services, transportation, insurance sector and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market "should remain tight in the near term", according to labour and welfare minister Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Statistics from the Labour Department suggest job hunters have much less choice. There were around 71,700 private-sector vacancies in July, a 31 percent decline from a year ago.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the three-month period ending in June, according to revised figures released by the government on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth followed a 2.8 percent increase in GDP in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, government economist Adolph Leung said he expects the economy to continue to expand, driven by strong export demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year. Exports of goods should sustain a positive performance if external demand holds up, though trade conflicts would present risks,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials kept this year's projected economic growth unchanged at 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It downgraded the projected inflation rate from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent for the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq rising more than 2 percent after July US retail sales data signaled resilient consumer spending, allaying fears of an imminent recession in the world's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Retail sales increased 1.0 percent after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent drop in June, easing fears of a sharp economic slowdown fanned by a jump in the unemployment rate last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail bellwether Walmart rose 6.58 percent after raising its annual profit forecast for the second time this year as Americans flocked to its stores for inexpensive essentials. Rivals Target and Costco also advanced 4.35 percent and 1.69 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate reading also showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell unexpectedly last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The wall of worry is beginning to crumble as sentiment is improving and the fundamentals support a risk-on bias," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. "Retail sales were above expectations, Consumer Price Index numbers came in at a tolerable level, so the fundamental backdrop is consistent with rising equity prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors have cautiously eyed this week's economic data releases, the last set before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivers a much-awaited speech at Jackson Hole next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39 percent, to 40,563. The S&P 500 gained 1.61 percent, at 5,543. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.34 percent, to 17,595.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other movers, Cisco Systems rose 6.8 percent after it forecast better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and said it was cutting 7 percent of its global workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike climbed 5.07 percent as billionaire investor William Ackman built new stakes in the sportswear company. Ulta Beauty jumped 11.17 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a stake in the cosmetics store chain. (Reuters)

    Ridership, property earnings boost MTR profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR Corporation has proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766327_1_20240815183232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday reported an almost 45 percent rise in first-half profit compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by a strong recovery in ridership and earnings from property development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the railway firm conceded that passenger numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, even after patronage jumped more than four percent to surpass 950 million in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jacob Kam, the MTR's chief executive officer, said ridership had not been "very good" in the second quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe there are many factors that would affect patronage, the overall economic situation, consumers' patterns, they all play a role," Kam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to be cautiously optimistic as the economy recovers. We hope that patronage will improve over time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, the railway giant posted a net profit of HK$6 billion, up 44.7 percent from the same period in 2023. Total revenue rose 6.2 percent year-on-year to HK$29.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the MTR proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share, same as the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm also reversed its HK$774 million Hong Kong railway business loss into a profit of HK$415 million, while earnings from property development more than doubled to HK$1.74 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are making progress on 14 residential property projects. We will continue to explore property development opportunities along our existing and future railway lines, making optimal use of all land resources," Kam added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the firm will roll out more discounts for commuters, he said the corporation has to invest more than HK$100 billion for its projects in the future, and that it has to be prudent with its finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the railway giant is looking to tender the Tung Chung East project again after it failed to receive any bids last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively studying our projects and we are looking at our tender strategy. Subject to market conditions, we shall continue to orderly tender out our land parcels, in order to meet with the demands of Hong Kong," said David Tang, the firm’s property and international business director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for a land use study near Pak Shek Kok, the corporation said the assessment, which includes the possibility of constructing a new station along the East Rail Line, is still ongoing.

    China retail sales improve, but factory output slows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's factory output growth slowed and missed expectations in July, but consumption figures were better than expected for that period. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766264_1_20240815122932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales rebounded in July while industrial production growth slowed, official data showed Thursday, highlighting an uneven recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Industrial output grew 5.1 percent from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed, slowing from the 5.3 percent pace in June and below expectations for a 5.2 percent increase in a Reuters poll of analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the NBS' monthly activity indicators showed retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 2.7 percent in July, quickening from a two percent increase in June and beating expectations for growth of 2.6 percent, a sign efforts to boost household spending were getting some traction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the jobs front, China's labour market remained stable in the January-July period as the surveyed urban unemployment rate dropped on a year-on-year basis, according to NBS data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average of surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first seven months of 2024, down 0.2 percentage points from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July alone, the unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, up from five percent in June but still lower than 5.3 percent a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts warn the broader outlook remained challenging for policymakers, suggesting more stimulus measures will be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The data shows that the economy has gotten off to a weak start in the second half of the year, and it is expected that the probability of replacing MLF with a RRR cut will increase, but key to maintaining five percent economic growth remains the arrival of fiscal spending," said ANZ China market economist Xing Zhaopeng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was referring to the People's Bank of China's medium-term lending facility and reserve requirement ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the central bank injected cash through a short-term bond instrument and said it would conduct an MLF rollover later this month as it extends liquidity support to the financial system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's central bank at a meeting earlier this month said it would step up financial support to the broader economy and efforts would be directed more at consumers to spur consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with domestic demand weak and the outlook unclear, households and businesses are in no rush to borrow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for more growth boosting measures have dogged officials ever since a widely expected post-pandemic recovery failed to materialise in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded 3.6 percent in the first seven months of 2024 year-on-year, but also missed expectations for a 3.9 percent rise and also slowed from the 3.9 percent growth in the January to June period. (Agencies and Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 ended higher on Wednesday, stretching its winning streak to five sessions, as the latest inflation data reassured investors betting the Federal Reserve would start cutting US interest rates next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also posted its fifth straight daily gain, although it barely scraped into positive territory as Alphabet and some megacap tech stocks weighed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moves were generally subdued with many investors away for August vacations, and new triggers for trading were absent, contributing to an overall listless picture among the benchmarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest US consumer price data, released earlier on Wednesday, reinforced expectations that the Fed would start interest rate cuts in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US consumer prices rose moderately in July, and the annual increase in inflation slowed to below 3 percent for the first time since early 2021. A day earlier, softer-than-expected producer prices data indicated inflation continued to moderate, although not yet all the way to the US central bank's 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments, said he called days such as this "markets violently going nowhere", adding with CPI painting a similar picture to PPI data, there was no reason for traders to reassess moves put in place on the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no huge rationale to move prices one way or another," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 closed at 5,455, up 0.38 percent. The Nasdaq Composite closed at 17,193, up 0.03 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.61 percent at 40,008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Alphabet, the Google-parent, dropped 2.3 percent on a media report that the US Department of Justice is considering options that include breaking up the online search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other megacaps were mixed: Tesla slumped 3.1 percent and Meta Platforms dropped 0.3 percent, while Microsoft fell 0.7 percent and Nvidia declined 1.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rebound in megacap and tech stocks has helped markets recoup most losses from a global market rout early this month after data showed the U.S. unemployment rate surged in July. (Reuters)

    Mars swallows Pringles maker in US$36bn deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pringles will now be part of a snack empire that also includes Mars products. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766209_1_20240815034438.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family-owned candy giant Mars is buying Cheez-It maker Kellanova in a nearly US$36 billion deal, bringing together brands from M&M's and Snickers to Pringles and Pop-Tarts in the year's biggest deal to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mars said on Wednesday it will pay US$83.50 per share for Kellanova, representing about a 33 percent premium to its closing price on August 2 before it was first reported that Mars was exploring a deal for the maker of frozen breakfast foods, such as Morningstar Farms and Eggo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal is a bet on consumers continuing to indulge in branded snacks, and comes as packaged food companies face stalling growth after years of price hikes to cover sky-rocketing inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The combined company aims to hold prices steady, said Mars CEO Poul Weihrauch, and not pass on costs from the deal to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a big and stronger company," Weihrauch said. "We hope to be able to absorb more costs in our structure and help alleviate the issues we have in an inflationary environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Food prices in the United States increased roughly 25 percent from 2019 through 2023, far more than other categories such as housing and medical care, according to data from the US Department of Agriculture. But inflation has started to moderate, according to the US consumer price index data released on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Consumers in the United States and Europe – major markets for both companies – have been looking for cheaper alternatives or ditching brands for cheaper private label goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kellanova has seen private label encroach on its market share for cereal in Europe and other areas, said CEO Steve Cahillane. The company sells sweet cereals such as Smacks, Frosties and Coco Pops in Europe, according to securities filings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US packaged food sector is seeing robust dealmaking as companies seek scale to weather the impact of inflation-weary consumers cutting back and shifting their purchases to private label brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think an environment more conducive to deal-making could also encourage some of the large-cap packaged food names within the industry to shift their focus away from portfolio cleanup and divestiture efforts and towards a more offensive, acquisition-led posture with a focus on growth," Barclays analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The infrastructure arm of Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison conglomerate announced on Wednesday that it would put in place a secondary share listing on the London Stock Exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure Holdings said in an announcement that it had sought permission from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, and expected to begin trading in its shares on the London bourse’s main market on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The company believes that a listing in London, in addition to the Company’s listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will benefit its geographically diverse shareholder base and will assist in building the company’s profile and provide a greater market for trading in the shares,” CK said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has been appointed to manage the listing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company noted that Britain was its largest market, with 35.7 percent of profit attributable to shareholders coming from the UK last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company had earlier announced a 2 percent increase in earnings for the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CK Infrastructure also announced that it was buying a portfolio of windfarms in the UK for HK$3.5 billion, its third acquisition of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tencent has posted a 72 percent year-on-year increase in interim net profit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  First-half earnings at the Chinese internet giant reached 89.5 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's not offering an interim dividend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Net profit for the April-June period, meanwhile, jumped 82 percent from a year ago to 47.6 billion yuan.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tech giant Foxconn on Wednesday reported a six percent jump in net profit for the second quarter of the year, driven by strong growth in demand for artificial intelligence servers.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple supplier Foxconn on Wednesday reported a six percent rise in second-quarter net profit, driven by strong AI server demand as the company touted "strong growth momentum" from the technology boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's largest contract electronics maker, said net profit for the April-June quarter rose to US$1.09 billion from US$1.02 billion in the same period the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That beat analysts' average estimate of US$1.06 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the firm's fourth consecutive quarterly profit rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said AI servers accounted for more than 40 percent of its server business in the second quarter, saying its next generation AI computing solution had brought "strong growth momentum."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foxconn had previously expected revenue for the second quarter to grow significantly from a year earlier, although revenue from smart computer electronics including smartphones was likely to be flattish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company expected its operations to pick up gradually in the second half as many electronics vendors, including Apple, usually release new products ahead of the year-end holiday season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a report prior to the earnings announcement, Taipei-based KGI Securities revised up its sales forecast for Foxconn this year, saying strong demand for new iPhones and AI servers were likely to lead to a better-than-expected outlook for the firm in the second half. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Tuesday as traders responded positively to cooler-than-expected producer inflation data, bolstering expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.1 percent in July, down slightly from a month earlier, the Labour Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data will likely be well-received by the Federal Reserve as it weighs the right time to begin cutting interest rates from their current 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices on Wall Street finished higher on Wednesday, led by the Nasdaq, which closed up 2.4 percent at 17,187.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished 1.0 percent higher at 39,765, and the S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent to 5,434.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trend in inflation is leading in the right direction, and today was good news," said Tom Cahill, from Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That suggests that the Fed will very likely cut the rates" in September, he added,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual firms, coffee giant Starbucks closed 24.5 percent higher after it named Chipotle chief executive Brian Niccol as its new CEO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the good news for Starbucks was bad news for Chipotle, whose shares closed down 7.5 percent following the news of Niccol's departure. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wholesale price increases in the United States eased in July, suggesting that inflation pressures are further cooling. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766045_1_20240813212653.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wholesale price increases in the United States eased in July, suggesting that inflation pressures were cooling further as the Federal Reserve moves closer to cutting interest rates, likely beginning next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Labor Department reported on Tuesday that its producer price index — which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers — rose 0.1 percent from June to July and 2.2 percent from a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to fluctuate from month to month, so-called core wholesale prices were unchanged from June and up 2.4 percent from July 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases were milder than forecasters had expected and were nearly consistent with the Fed's two percent inflation target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index can provide an early sign of where consumer inflation is headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably healthcare and financial services, flow into the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Labor Department will release the most well-known inflation measure, the consumer price index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters have estimated that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent from June to July, after actually falling 0.1 percent the previous month, and three percent from July 2023, according to a survey by the data firm FactSet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation has plummeted since peaking at a four-decade high in mid-2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as Americans prepare to vote in the November presidential election, many remain unhappy with consumer prices, which are nearly 19 percent higher than were before the inflationary surge began in the spring of 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have assigned blame to US President Joe Biden, though it's unclear whether they will hold Vice President Kamala Harris responsible as she seeks the presidency. (AP)

    'High interest rates weigh on SMEs confidence'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Senior Standard Chartered economist Kelvin Lau (right) says lingering global uncertainties have affected SME business confidence. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766023_1_20240813172255.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Productivity Council on Tuesday warned that a high interest rate environment is putting pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with business confidence among SMEs dropping to the lowest point in two years
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a quarterly survey conducted by the council in July, 56 percent of the 814 local businesses interviewed said high interest rates had affected consumer spending, with the most affected industries being retail, accommodation and food services and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, about one-third of the SMEs interviewed said they had a cash flow or supply chain problem because of the high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said business sentiment among SMEs remained cautious, with the latest Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index recording a decline in confidence to 42.5 points, dropping from 47.3 in the previous quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief innovation officer Lawrence Cheung said 10 of the 11 industries involved in the survey had shown a drop in confidence, with real estate having the lowest score. He said that indicated both external and domestic-oriented sectors were under-performing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Standard Chartered senior economist Kelvin Lau said the survey indicated a lack of confidence among SMEs over the global economic outlook due to external uncertainties lingering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Number one is the possibility of [Donald] Trump coming into office after the US elections in November. And the other being China's recent macro data weakness following its slightly weaker than expected Q2 GDP [growth], which came in at 4.7 percent rather than anything closer to 5 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So overall, it's kind of like a double whammy that the local businesses need to worry about the US and they need to worry about China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he added there are certain bright spots, citing expectations the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates from September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our own view is that we could see a collective 75 basis points of cuts between now and the year-end and possibly even more cuts in the first half of next year, to as much as 125 basis points in total,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So that would hopefully be a lot of relief to the Hong Kong SMEs, in particular the real estate sector, for example, and to some extent the accommodation and food services sector as well.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Results on Wall Street were mixed on Monday, with markets in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the release of US inflation data this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.4 percent to 39,357, while the S&P 500 was flat at 5,344.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq gained 0.2 percent to 16,780.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is another one of these watch-and-wait days," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The volume is not very high," he added, while noting the week ahead would be "busy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In particular, investors are eyeing a report on the consumer price index – a key inflation gauge – due out on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This "should have some effect on how we view the battle against inflation," Sosnick added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to start lowering interest rates at its meeting in September, although a weaker than expected labour market report at the start of this month fanned fears surrounding the US economy's health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are monitoring to see if inflation is cooling at a gradual pace – signalling the world's biggest economy is indeed achieving a "soft landing" where price increases ease without a downturn.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog on Sunday that Hong Kong should integrate further with China's national development and contribute to modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan said that the Third Plenary Session held in Beijing last month passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform and Promoting Chinese-style Modernization," which outlines Hong Kong's strategic positioning in leveraging the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, enhances the city's status as an international hub, and supports Hong Kong's bid in gathering top international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an international financial centre, Chan said that Hong Kong should fulfil its role as an offshore RMB business hub, focusing on shipping centre development, smart shipping, and green shipping, to make Hong Kong a "cross-border supply chain management centre" that provides one-stop support for mainland enterprises in expanding their production capacity and supply chain layout overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said this will generate new trade service demands and attract greater opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the SAR government is also recruiting talent and has launched a series of initiatives like the Top Talent Pass Scheme that supports talent development, to attract more top international talent to the region.

    US inflation still 'uncomfortably' high: Fed official

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US inflation remains "uncomfortably" above the Federal Reserve's target despite the progress it has made in recent months, a senior bank official said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank has held interest rates at a two-decade high for the past year as it battles to return inflation to its long-term target of two percent following a pandemic-era surge in prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed's favoured inflation gauge now sits at an annual rate of just 2.5 percent – well below the peak reached in 2022 – while the US economy is still growing and the labour market has weakened somewhat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against this backdrop, Fed chair Jerome Powell suggested in late July that the bank could move ahead with its first interest rate cut as soon as September – if economic data continues to come in as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some Fed officials have been more cautious about signalling rate cuts than others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The progress in lowering inflation during May and June is a welcome development," Fed governor Michelle Bowman told a conference in Colorado Springs, according to prepared remarks. "But inflation is still uncomfortably above the committee's two percent goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite "upside risks," Bowman said she still expects inflation to ease in the coming months, but warned policymakers to remain patient "and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to a single data point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The remarks from Bowman, who is a permanent voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, suggest she remains concerned about cutting interest rates too soon – despite overwhelming support for a September rate cut in the financial markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures traders are now wholly convinced that the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September, and are instead split over how big its first cut will be, according to data from CME Group. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street ended a volatile week higher. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765571_1_20240810042652.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended higher on Friday after a tumultuous week in which markets clawed their way back from Monday's steep dive that was prompted by fears of a recession and unwinding of a global yen-funded carry trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to end at 5,344, the Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.5 percent to 16,745. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 percent to 39,497.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology sector led gains in the index for the day, while the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's "fear gauge", was down on Friday after surging to 65.73 at the start of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Fed policymakers expressed confidence that inflation was cooling enough to allow interest-rate cuts ahead, and will take their cues on the size and timing of those cuts from the economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's big decline followed a sharp sell-off last week as a weaker-than-expected July jobs report sparked recession fears, and the Bank of Japan's decision to hike interest rates on July 31 led to a sharp appreciation in the yen. That resulted in the unwinding of currency carry trade positions in which the yen is used to buy high-yielding assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For most of the last week the negative opinions were driving sentiment and direction and those have been outweighed by a little less pessimism," in recent days, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he said, "there is going to continue to be a significant amount of uncertainty and anxiety hanging over the market for the course of the next month until we get to the next Fed meeting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors see a 55 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on September 17-18, with a 25 basis point cut seen as having a 45 percent probability, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors also await next week's readings on US consumer prices and retail sales for July, which could provide fresh evidence on the chances of a soft landing for the American economy. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street bounced back, with all three major indices ending the session higher. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765409_1_20240809043424.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Thursday in Wall Street’s latest sharp swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries about the slowing economy .
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 jumped 119.81 points, or 2.3 percent, to 5,319.31, for its best day since 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683.04 points, or 1.8 percent to 39,446.49, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 464.22 points, or 2.9 percent to 16,660.02.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A week ago worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims fuelled worries that the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates at too high for too long. That sent markets reeling, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that hit the carry trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down about 9 percent from its all-time set last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the market’s swings look more like a “positioning-driven crash” caused by too many investors piling into similar trades and then exiting them together, rather than the start of a long-term downward market caused by a recession, according to strategists at BNP Paribas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say it looks more similar to the “flash crash” of 2010 than the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 recession caused by the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course, markets have been quick to turn over the past week regardless of any long-term predictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Today’s jobless claims data may ease some of the concerns raised by last week’s soft jobs report,” said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. “But with inflation data due out next week and the stock market still working through its biggest pullback of the year, it’s unclear how much this will move the sentiment needle.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the meantime, big US companies continue to turn in profit reports for the spring that are mostly better than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Big Tech stocks also rose to claw back some of their sharp losses from the last month. (AP)

    Apple says it's falling into line with new EU rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The EU is also investigating Apple over changes previously made to comply with new European digital laws by allowing third-party app stores. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765399_1_20240809022302.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday announced changes to its App Store after the European Union accused the iPhone maker of breaking the bloc's landmark new digital rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU said the App Store terms prevented app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative ways to pay, making Apple the first ever tech firm to face accusations of breaching a new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now Apple says there will be changes to comply with the DMA and address the findings of the European Commission, the EU's powerful antitrust regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels at the time said developers could only steer customers through a link in their app that redirected the user to a web page to conclude any contracts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regulators said Apple placed "several restrictions" meaning app developers could not communicate, promote offers and conclude contracts through the channel of their choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the autumn, Apple said developers in the EU "can communicate and promote offers for purchases" wherever they want, for example, via an alternative app marketplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in Thursday's announcement, Apple said the changes mean developers will have a new fee structure for customers linking out of an app for offers and content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For instance, developers will have to pay a five-percent fee on sales of digital goods and services made on any platforms within a year of a user first installing an app with the ability to link out to a different channel such as a website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the big tech firms modify their platforms in accordance with EU rules, they can avoid large penalties. The DMA demands the EU wrap up any probe within a year of its start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission told AFP it "will assess Apple's eventual changes to the compliance measures, also taking into account any feedback from the market, notably developers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges against Apple came after the commission launched investigations in March into Apple, Facebook owner Meta and Google under the DMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta also faced formal accusations of violating the DMA in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DMA gives big tech a list of what they can and can't do in business in a bid to increase competition in the digital sphere. For example, they must offer choice screens for web browsers and search engines to give users more options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law gives the EU the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. This can rise to up to 20 percent for repeat offenders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also faces daily penalties of up to five percent of its average daily worldwide turnover if found to be non-compliant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Coalition for App Fairness, whose members include Swedish streaming giant Spotify and which has long called for Apple to open up its marketplace, dismissed the latest Apple announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the introduction of yet another confusing, arbitrary, and expensive fee structure, Apple continues to evade compliance and make the digital landscape in Europe more complicated for developers and more costly for consumers," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU is also investigating Apple over changes previously made to comply with the DMA by allowing third-party app stores. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US court has ordered bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX to pay US$12.7 billion in relief to its customers, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  FTX drew customers in with "an illusion that it was a safe and secure place to access crypto markets," then misappropriated their customer deposits to make its own risky investments, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The repayment order implements a settlement between the CFTC and the bankrupt crypto exchange, which has committed to a bankruptcy liquidation that will repay customers whose deposits were locked during its late 2022 collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX has said its customers will receive 100 percent recovery on their claims against the company, based on the value of their accounts at the time it filed for bankruptcy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CFTC agreement resolves a potential roadblock to that repayment, ensuring that the government's lawsuit against FTX will not reduce the funds available to its customers. The CFTC agreed not to collect any payment from FTX until all its customers are repaid, with interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CFTC settlement requires FTX to pay US$8.7 billion in restitution and US$4 billion in disgorgement, which will be used to further compensate victims for losses suffered during the exchange's collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for stealing US$8 billion from customers. He has appealed the conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX has used its bankruptcy to reach settlements with US regulators and former business partners and to sell assets that had been purchased with misappropriated customer funds, including real estate and investments in crypto and other tech companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX is currently soliciting votes on its bankruptcy proposal but faces opposition from some customers who feel short-changed by the decision to repay them based on much-lower cryptocurrency prices from November 2022. Votes are due on August 16, and FTX intends to seek final approval of its wind-down plan on October 7. (Reuters)

 The Hang Seng Index fell 104.82 points, or 0.62 percent, to open at 16,773.04 on Thursday.

  <br/>
  Investors have been worried about a possible US recession and weaker-than-expected forecasts from US companies.

  Markets are also awaiting more commentary on monetary policy from US central bank officials next week, in the run-up to the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, event where Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street finished lower on Wednesday after an early rally petered out. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765247_1_20240808055746.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished lower on Wednesday after an early rally petered out, in a sign of lingering unease after recent equity market weakness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is what happens when you have a big risk-off type of event," Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers, said of Monday's equity market plunge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's normal to see the market display uncertainty," said Sosnick, who pointed to a poorly received US Treasury bond auction as further evidence of investor angst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 38,763.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,199, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.1 percent to 16,195.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices sank more than 2.5 percent on Monday amid worries over a potential US recession and the unwinding of the so-called "carry trade" that took advantage of the weak yen prior to last week's interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many analysts expect more effects from the unwinding, extending a period of volatility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney fell 4.5 percent despite reporting better than expected earnings as investors digested commentary that a weakening of demand in the parks business "could impact the next few quarters."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airbnb slumped 13.4 percent after reporting lower than expected profits and cautioning of "some signs of slowing demand from US guests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TripAdvisor also fell sharply after earnings, tumbling 16.7 percent. (AFP)

    Cathay declares interim dividend despite profit drop

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cathay Pacific says it will buy 30 Airbus wide-body aircraft with an option to purchase another 30. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765141_1_20240807130622.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Wednesday announced an interim dividend due to its strong performance in the first six months of 2024, despite reporting a drop in first-half profit from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm added that a decrease in profit for its airlines and subsidiaries was "principally attributable to the normalisation of ticket prices".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group recorded a 14 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our strong performance for the first six months of the year was primarily driven by the ongoing robust demand for travel, and the solid performance of our cargo business," said the airline's chairman Patrick Healy in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This result has allowed us to announce a first interim dividend payment to ordinary shareholders of HK$0.20 per ordinary share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay's budget arm, HK Express, reported a loss of HK$73 million in the first half of the year, following earnings of HK$333 million in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Lam said the low-cost carrier had been facing engine issues and regional competition, but he remained confident in the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of those aircraft are on ground and not being able to generate revenue for HK Express in the short term," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second issue HK Express is facing short-term, is the very keen competition among short-haul carriers based in Hong Kong, as well as the foreign low-cost carriers flying into Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Healy said the company is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic flight levels within the first quarter of 2025 as it enters "the final stretch" of its rebuilding journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are increasing our group headcount by 5,000 to a total of 29,000 people by the end of this year to support this pace of growth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline had also bought back HK$19.5 billion in preference shares acquired by the government as part of a bailout package to stay afloat, and said it would continue to maintain a lower level of liquidity than it did during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of its fleet, Cathay said it would buy 30 Airbus A330-900 wide-body aircraft, with an option to purchase 30 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not disclose the purchase price but said it received "significant price concessions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The basic price is about US$11 billion, or roughly HK$85.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These new regional wide-body aircraft are expected to be delivered from 2028 and will join the Cathay Pacific fleet, principally serving destinations in Asia. We now have more than 100 new-generation aircraft in our delivery pipeline, with the rights to acquire 80 additional aircraft in future," Healy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The purchase of Airbus aircraft is part of an investment drive of more than HK$100 billion over the next seven years, which also includes newly designed lounges and cabin products.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Growth in China's exports slowed last month while imports returned to the black, customs data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Exports were up 7 percent in July year on year after posting an 8.6 percent increase the month before, the strongest rise in 15 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's figure was the weakest since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of the year taken together, exports rose 6.7 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, rose at a robust 7.2 percent last month, compared with a 2.3 percent contraction in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's imports growth was the fastest in three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports climbed 5.4 percent in the January-July period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus narrowed to US$84.65 billion in July from US$99.05 billion in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, the trade surplus expanded by 7.9 percent year on year to US$518 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns remained for the world's second-largest economy after second-quarter GDP growth slowed to 4.7 percent from 5.3 percent in the January-March period, keeping alive calls for policymakers to roll out more support to reach the government's full-year growth target of around 5 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong market opened stronger on Wednesday, taking its cue from Wall Street, which partially rebounded from a sell-off in the previous session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index was up 37.44 points, or 0.22 percent, at 16,684.78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the United States, investors returned to the market after soothing comments by Federal Reserve officials eased US recession worries, with the S&P and the Nasdaq both gaining more than one percent, and the Dow rising 0.8 percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rebounded on Tuesday after three straight days of losses, with analysts pointing to bargain hunting and US bond markets bouncing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gains in New York also followed a quieter day in most overseas stock markets and came as Caterpillar and Uber reported solid earnings, lifting shares of both companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm hopeful that we'll get some stability back," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that there could still be "a little more downside risks to the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.8 percent at 38,997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,240, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 1.0 percent to 16,366.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices fell more than 2.5 percent on Monday in a move seen as a reflection of worries about a US recession following Friday's disappointing jobs data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market watchers have also pointed to ripple effects from Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and have led to liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei, which slumped 12.4 percent on Monday, jumped 10.2 percent on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reversal in the US equity market came as US Treasury bond yields climbed and as a closely-watched volatility index retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Caterpillar gained 3.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as strong pricing offset the hit from lower revenues. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered a bruising rout on Monday, extending a pullback attributed to economic unease and fallout from recent lurches in overseas financial markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major indices spent the entire day in the red, with the Dow Jones losing 2.6 percent, or more than 1,000 points, to finish at 38,703.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 3.0 percent to end at 5,186, while the Nasdaq dropped 3.4 percent to 16,200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses followed down days last Thursday and Friday on the heels of poor US employment data and a negative survey from manufacturers that sparked worries about a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seizing on that point, some market watchers have called for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – perhaps even in an emergency meeting – after the central bank kept rates unchanged last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But market watchers are also focusing on the ripple effects of Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and slammed Japan's Nikkei equity market, which dove 12.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an abrupt move in a market that has a lot of tentacles," Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said of the Japan currency shift, which is believed to have led to speedy liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan believes the Japan currency movements are much more a factor in the turbulence than recession fears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survey results of services companies by the Institute for Supply Management showed stronger than expected growth, boosting US Treasury bond yields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts at High Frequency Economics called the report "a refreshingly stronger-than-expected outcome" that helps to counter the gloom from last week's economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether it will turn around the US equity sell-off is to be determined, of course," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet dropped 4.6 percent after a US judge sided with antitrust officials who had alleged that the company operated a monopoly with its dominant search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also had a bad day, losing 4.8 percent on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had cut its stake in the tech giant. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bank of China (Hong Kong) said the outlook for the SAR and mainland economies is positive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said the local economy is seeing a stable recovery, with strong inbound tourist figures and low unemployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also said retail sales remained weak and housing prices could drop "by a small margin" this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the world's second-largest economy, the bank believes it will reach its 5 percent growth target for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still believe that the growth rate in China will eventually translate to the growth rate in China's enterprise sector, I mean all the corporates in China," said Ding Meng, senior economist of Bank of China (Hong Kong).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we are anticipating the improvement of the profits prospect in China-related investments, so we are kind of positive for the stock market here in Hong Kong and also in mainland China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank also said it expects the US Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September or December this year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says hot weather led to increased electricity demand. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764812_1_20240805153704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday announced a mid-year net profit of HK$5.95 billion, a near 18 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company said Hong Kong’s accelerated economic recovery, along with hotter weather, led to increased electricity demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Australian and Indian business also improved, offsetting the impact of reduced electricity generation at its nuclear power plants on the mainland due to scheduled maintenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP also pointed to various renewable energy projects on the mainland, saying they will be the key drivers for its profit in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s revenue rose to HK$44.09 billion, an almost 2 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.63 per share, matching the first interim dividend of the year and unchanged from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have always been generating revenue and dividends for the benefit of our shareholders. And we adopt a policy to have a reliable and consistent dividend with steady growth supported by sustainable business development,” said CLP's chief executive officer TK Chiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we will continue to grow the business and if the condition approves, of course, we will try to adjust our dividend. But at the end of the day, the dividend will be approved by the board.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiang also said any further reduction in prices for consumers in the remainder of the year will depend on the international fuel market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because of the continued easing of the energy prices globally, we saw tariff reduction. From January up to August, the tariff for CLP's customers in Hong Kong saw a reduction of about 2 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the remaining part of the year, it will really depend on the international fuel price trend. If the fuel price continues to follow the current trend, there could be an opportunity for further adjustments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about progress in reviewing its power management system following several voltage dips this year, Chiang said the company is working on solutions to minimise the impact such incidents have on customers.

    Nikkei suffers record points loss

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff, driven by last week's plunge in global stock markets, economic concerns and worries investments funded by a cheap yen were being unwound.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei share average shed a staggering 12.4 percent as Friday's dismal US jobs data heightened worries of a possible recession, and as the yen rallied to seven-month highs versus the US dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27 percent drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the close on Monday, the index closed at 31,458.42 and had wiped out 113 trillion yen (US$792.32 billion) of that peak market value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks," said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after a soft jobs report stoked fears of an oncoming recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the US economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike," said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yen was last up 2.5 percent at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14 percent in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The banking sector slumped 17 percent to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broader Topix fell 12.2 percent to 2,227.15. (Reuters)

    Cathay to increase flights to Phnom Penh

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Saturday announced it will offer daily flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh from October 27, up from the current five trips per week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came after the CEO of the SAR's flag carrier, Ronald Lam, signed an agreement to boost its partnership with Cambodia Airports during Chief Executive John Lee's recent six-day Asean trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision is also part of Cathay's plan to prepare for the completion of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group emphasised that it will continue to strengthen its existing routes, as well as expand its network and collaboration with Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, this year marks the 75th anniversary since Cathay operated its inaugural flight to Vietnam. The airline announced that it will kick off another round of recruitment in the country this month, after welcoming more than 170 Vietnamese flight attendants earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And low-cost airline Hong Kong Express, which is owned by Cathay, is planning to start flights between Hong Kong and Phu Quoc – a Vietnamese island – in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay currently flies to 17 Asean destinations, with over 360 flights per week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday following a disappointing US jobs report that raised recession worries while also boosting the odds of interest rate cuts by the Fed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy added 114,000 jobs last month, a drop from the prior month and fewer than expected, while the jobless rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest level since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report added to recession fears following lacklustre manufacturing data on Thursday, with losses in the week's final two days leaving all three major indices down for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 39,737, down 1.5 percent for the day and 2.1 percent for the week.
  <br/>

  "Historically it's very difficult to achieve a soft landing," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. "It's easy for a soft landing to sneak up on you and become a hard landing. And that's what the market is very much afraid of right now."

  But Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said the market is likely overreacting to a few weak data points, noting that most of the corporate earnings released in the last few weeks have been solid.

  <br/>
  "Investors are ready to shoot first and ask questions later," Hogan said.

  Amazon also had a bad day, losing nearly nine percent on worries about the tech giant's profit outlook after revenues fell short of expectations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with sustained higher interest rates taking a toll on businesses and consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Friday’s report from the US Labor Department showed that employers added just 114,000 jobs in July – 35 percent fewer than forecasters had expected – and that unemployment, now up to 4.3 percent, was the highest since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Things are deteriorating quickly,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news shook financial markets around the world, with the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq both dropping sharply at the open of trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sturdiness of the US economy — the world’s largest — has been a key driver of global economic growth and the US jobs market is a big reason for it, underpinning the American expansion and giving consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unemployment rate's jump to 4.3 percent in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signalled that the United States is in recession — though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the topsy-turvy post-pandemic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weak jobs report came two days after the Federal Reserve said it would hold off on cutting interest rates until it sees more evidence that inflation is continuing to move down and closer to its 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterised the American job market as healthy, despite growing calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high, to pre-empt a major weakening of the US economy and job market. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index on Friday was down about 1.4 percent, or 240 points, in early trading at 17,064.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sell-off came after Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday following weak manufacturing data, sparking worries about a US recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, European stocks had slumped on disappointing bank earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US indices finished decisively lower, with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index falling the most at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets will get another key US economic data point on Friday with monthly jobs data. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

    Wall Street ends down on jitters over manufacturing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street initially opened stronger, but changed direction after manufacturing data raised concerns about the economy. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764341_1_20240802042650.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks kicked off August sharply lower after a round of economic data on Thursday spurred concerns the economy may be slowing faster than anticipated while the Federal Reserve maintains a restrictive monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities initially opened higher, partly lifted by Meta Platforms after its quarterly results topped expectations and the Facebook parent issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the early gains evaporated after data showed a measure of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) dropped to an eight-month low in July at 46.8, signifying contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What you’re seeing now, and you will probably see it for the next month or two, is some kind of consolidation and sideways price action," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bigger picture bull trend is intact ... But we're in a period now where the market is kind of digesting its gains sideways, back and forth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 lost 75.62 points, or 1.4 percent, to end at 5,446.68, the Nasdaq Composite lost 405.26 points, or 2 .3 percent, to 17,194.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 494.82 points, or 1.2 percent, to 40,347.97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  August is typically one of the weakest months of the year for stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other data showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labour market, although seasonal factors also played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will eye government payroll data later on Friday for signs of further weakness in the labour market. (Reuters)
