 The Hang Seng Index climbed 140 points, or 0.79 percent, to open at 18,056 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rise in the local bourse tracked gains across the region as Asian shares rose to their highest level in three weeks at the start of trading on Wednesday, boosted by a rally in tech stocks while the dollar wobbled after soft US retail sales data reinforced expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates later this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 reaching a new record on a day that Nvidia edged ahead of Microsoft to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chip company, which has enjoyed a monumental ascent over the last 18 months amid enthusiasm over generative AI, closed 3.5 percent higher, giving it a market capitalisation of about US$3.3 trillion, slightly ahead of the tech giants Microsoft and Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were kind of waiting for this moment, actually, for quite some time," said Angelo Zino from the financial intelligence firm CFRA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The semiconductor industry is now the biggest sub-industry in the S&P 500," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices rose on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 rising 0.3 percent to reach a new all-time high of 5,487.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.2 percent to 38,834, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq finished up less than 0.1 percent at 17,862.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid the ongoing enthusiasm for Nvidia, other chip companies saw gains on Tuesday, including Qualcomm and Micron, which closed up 2.2 percent and 3.8 percent respectively. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia edged ahead of other tech companies on Tuesday to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in the latest sign of the might of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chip company, which has enjoyed a monumental ascent over the last 18 months amid enthusiasm over generative AI, jumped 3.4 percent near 1:25 pm (1725 GMT), giving it a market capitalisation of about US$3.3 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft and Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The California-based company, which is led by Jensen Huang, has seen profits soar due to torrid demand for its powerful GPU chips, which have set the industry's pace in pushing new advances in AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, Nvidia reported a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe over the next year the race to US$4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft," said a note earlier this week from Wedbush Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Christopher Hui (middle) says there's a "holistic package" of support given to small-sized brokers over arrangements for remote working during severe weather. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757998_1_20240618184720.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small and medium-sized brokers have enough time and support to get themselves ready, officials said on Tuesday, as the financial market is set to remain in operation under severe weather conditions from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The securities and derivatives markets, including northbound and southbound trading, will continue operating during severe weather conditions, while banks and securities dealers will provide electronic services but shut down their physical outlets, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brokers are required to set up a remote office and adopt digital trading by the implementation date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For those failing to meet the requirements, they can assign a small number of staff to return to their workplaces in times of typhoons and heavy rain, in accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said there’s a “holistic package” of support for brokers, especially smaller-sized firms, to put arrangements for remote working in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Technically we have the solutions ready in the market and the HKEx has already set out in the consultation document conclusions that they will provide necessary support in order to connect the potential service providers to the participants if they are needed,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Incentives are being given to the participants to upgrade themselves because for those that cannot do that before the end of September, if they need more time, we will support them through shouldering the relevant clearing responsibilities. At the same time, the regulators will pragmatically deal with their relevant compliance issues if they cannot during that period move everything online."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial services chief said people can draw on the experience of remote working during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Working from home or using technology or online, whatever systems are available to do all the arrangements, it's not something new to the market, and especially during Covid times when already certain members of our financial community are already doing that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what we are proposing here is not drastic change but rather incremental change which is contingent on experience that we get before.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that tests will be conducted in August to check market readiness, but noting that the official implementation will not be delayed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial industry on Tuesday welcomed the government's move to keep the local stock market open during typhoons and heavy rain storms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's stock market will continue trading under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robert Lee, who represents the financial services sector, said the new arrangement could enhance Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Lee, who is also a director of the Hong Kong Securities Association, called on authorities to offer more support to small and medium-sized financial institutions to help them adapt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The industry had been expecting it for quite some time now, especially it being mentioned in the Policy Address as well as the Budget. I think international firms and larger scale firms fully support this initiative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for some of the SMEs, or the local brokers, I would encourage the SAR government as well as HKEX to provide more assistance to them as they adapt to the new measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan said the industry now had sufficient time to prepare to operate in severe weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the right time to implement such kind of arrangement because during the last few years (of the) epidemic situation, a number of electronic trading systems and business solutions have been upgraded," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because the implementation time will be this September, now we have sufficient time for us to effectively assist those smaller-scale firms to smoothly transition to the new arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Funds Association and accounting firm KPMG welcomed the new arrangement, saying it would put Hong Kong's bourse in line with other major markets on the mainland and overseas.

    KPMG downgrades local IPO outlook

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Irene Chu says regional and global uncertainty is weighing on IPO valuations.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Accountancy giant KPMG on Tuesday said it has downgraded its expectations for Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) market this year, citing a global decline in dealmaking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  KPMG now expects to see up to 80 companies listing, raising HK$60 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, the accountancy firm had projected 90 listings, with revenue of HK$100 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, KPMG's Head of New Economy and Life Sciences Irene Chu said regional and global uncertainty is weighing on valuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no shortage of companies that want to apply for an IPO... A lot of the time, it is about how attractive they are to investors," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is not as much about the local economic condition, it actually has a lot to do with the regional and global situation when it comes to interest rates and economic performance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, Hong Kong saw 27 IPOs which raised HK$12 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was down from 31 listings with revenue of HK$18 billion in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KPMG said it expects Hong Kong will see more IPOs in the second half of the year thanks to the loosening of listing rules as well as supportive measures from the nation's market regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing earlier introduced the Chapter 18C listing regime, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, meanwhile, rolled out five measures to strengthen Hong Kong's status as a financial centre.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investors will still be able to trade in the city's financial market under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee made the announcement ahead of his weekly Executive Council meeting, saying Hong Kong has no valid reason to stop the financial market operating during severe weather conditions, when other major financial hubs are able to continue trading in such circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other securities markets around the world such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, they maintain trading even under severe weather conditions. Hong Kong is the only exception. Hong Kong is an international financial centre and there is no reason for us not to align with international standards," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the move would consolidate the competitiveness of HKEx and raise Hong Kong's role as a trading corridor with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing a public consultation exercise carried out by HKEx, Lee said about 90 percent of brokerages and banks support keeping the financial market open under severe weather conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the implementation date in late September will give the trade enough time to prepare, and the relevant authorities will offer support to small brokerages to cope with the change.

 Wall Street stocks began the week on a strong note, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finishing at records spurred on by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence.

  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq led the major indices, climbing 1.0 percent to 17,857, a closing record for the sixth straight day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones climbed 0.5 percent to 38,778, while the S&P 500 also finished at an all-time high, rising 0.8 percent to 5,473.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not a broad rally but it's a rally with the index up for sure," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, who pointed to recent share price gains of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia as a source of momentum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan also noted that the outlook for US monetary policy had improved somewhat following last week's US inflation data, which kept alive the chance of interest rate cuts in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's calendar includes the release of US retail sales data, as well a Bank of England policy meeting.

  Among individual companies, Boeing advanced 0.7 percent as markets look ahead to Tuesday's hearing in the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations into the aviation giant's safety problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop slumped 12.1 percent on disappointment that the company did not provide any major announcements at its annual meeting. The company has been in focus lately with the resurfacing of "meme" stock figure Keith Gill, who has touted the company.

  Markets will be closed on Wednesday to mark the Juneteenth National Independence Day. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday said it had launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork and pork by-products from the European Union.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce has opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of relevant pork and pig by-products originating from the European Union," the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation would begin on June 17, the ministry said, and was prompted by a complaint submitted by the China Animal Husbandry Association on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry said the investigation should be completed by June 17, 2025, but could be extended by another six months if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the European Commission's June 12 announcement that it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from July, global food companies have been on high alert for retaliatory tariffs from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities on the mainland had previously dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows improving consumer sentiment, although industrial output lagged expectations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757755_1_20240617113531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales figures in May, a major indicator of consumption sentiment, rose 3.7 percent year on year to 3.92 trillion yuan, accelerating from a 2.3 percent increase in April and marking the quickest rate of growth since February.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newly released data on Monday from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) also showed that retail sales climbed 4.1 percent year on year in the first five months of 2024, to hit 19.52 trillion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected retail sales to grow three percent due to the five-day public holiday earlier in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, industrial output on the mainland lagged expectations with the property sector still weak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial data released by the NBS came in below expectations for a six percent increase, with output rising only 5.6 percent year on year in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded four percent in the first five months of 2024 from the same period a year earlier, versus expectations for a 4.2 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It grew 4.2 percent in the January to April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS also reported that China's raw coal output fell three percent year on year to 1.86 billion tonnes in the first five months of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May alone, the country's raw coal output stood at 380 million tonnes, down 0.8 percent year on year, although the decline was 2.1 percentage points narrower than in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's property market downturn, high local government debt and deflation remained heavy drags on economic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest figures point to an uneven growth pattern that reinforced calls for more fiscal and monetary policy support from the central government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With narrowing interest margins and a weakening currency remaining key constraints limiting Beijing's scope to ease monetary policy, China's central bank left a key policy rate unchanged as expected on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's second-largest economy grew faster than expected at 5.3 percent in the first quarter, but analysts said the government's around five percent annual growth target was ambitious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's exports grew faster than expected in May helped by improved global demand, but growth in imports slowed significantly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tepid demand at home has also kept a lid on consumer prices as confidence remains low in the face of a protracted property sector crisis while new bank lending rebounded less than expected in May. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 edged lower on Friday, ending a four-day run of record closing highs, but gains in Adobe and other technology shares limited the decline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 technology sector rose, with Adobe shares jumping after the company raised its annual revenue forecast on more demand for its artificial intelligence-powered software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also digesting economic data to gauge how soon the Federal Reserve might be able to cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index slipped to 65.6 in June, sharply lower than expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Fed policymakers dialed back their projections for three cuts this year to just one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main situation here is we've got an extended market," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York. "You've had a big rally this week, led by big-cap tech. Under the surface, we have a lot of areas acting weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent, to end at 5,432, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.14 percent, to 17,688. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.14 percent, to 38,591.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russell small-cap index fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said he was relieved after data this week showed inflation in May had cooled, but he would still like to see "more months" of similar data before cutting interest rates.

    Rebound in Chinese lending less than expected in May

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New lending by Chinese banks was not as strong as expected in May. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757494_1_20240614211921.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New bank lending in China rebounded far less than expected in May, and some key money gauges hit record lows, suggesting the world's second-largest economy continued to face headwinds even as the central bank seeks to bolster confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chinese banks issued 950 billion yuan in new loans last month, compared to 730 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters' calculations based on the latest data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) released on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted loans would rise to 1.255 trillion yuan but would still be below the 1.36 trillion yuan issued in May last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China’s credit extension came in lower than expected in May, suggesting that the deleveraging in the households continues," said Zhou Hao, chief economist at Guotai Junan International.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhou said China's central bank may be reluctant to cut interest rates any time soon, as that could lead to further depreciation of the yuan as the US Federal Reserve seems in no hurry to start cutting its rates, which is buoying the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Balancing all the factors, we think that the PBOC would refrain from policy rate cuts for now but provide more targeted support via relending programmes over the foreseeable future," he said. (Reuters)

    Tesla approves Musk's multi-billion dollar pay deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to restore CEO Elon Musk's record pay package. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757465_1_20240614175814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's US$56 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The favorable vote doesn’t necessarily mean that Musk will get the all-stock compensation anytime soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The package is likely to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court and Supreme Court for months as Tesla tries to overturn the Delaware judge's rejection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electric car maker's stock remains richly valued even after several years of weakness in shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shareholders at Tesla's annual general meeting on Thursday re-approved Musk's 2018 record-setting compensation that backers said was necessary to keep the billionaire focused on the car company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk had raised doubts about his future with Tesla this year, writing on X, the social media platform he owns, that he wanted a 25 percent stake in the company in order to stop him from taking his artificial intelligence development projects elsewhere. The higher stake was needed to control the use of AI, he has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla's stock rose nearly three percent on Thursday ahead of the meeting after Musk posted on X that he had won shareholder approval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even after Thursday's gains, Tesla's shares have tumbled 27 percent this year, and its market value has been more than halved to US$582 billion from its November 2021 high as Tesla faces fierce competition in China from BYD and other EV makers selling less-expensive cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla's shares received a badly needed boost after Musk said on April 23 that Tesla would release more affordable new models in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its quarterly revenue fell for the first time since 2020, when the pandemic hampered production and deliveries. (Agencies)

    Fresh data signals weakness in US jobs market

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A “Help Wanted” sign hangs in a restaurant window in Medford, Massachusetts. There are now signs that the US jobs market is weakening as new claims for unemployment benefits climb. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757342_1_20240613224642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a 10-month high last week, suggesting the labour market was losing momentum and keeping hopes of a September interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve alive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was reinforced by other data from the Labour Department on Thursday showing producer prices unexpectedly falling in May. The largest decline in prices at the factory gate since last October followed news on Wednesday that consumer prices were unchanged in May. The US central bank on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25 percent-5.5 percent range, where it has been since last July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with policymakers projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists, however, remained optimistic that the Fed would reduce borrowing costs twice this year, starting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These data nudge the door a little wider open for the Fed to start cutting interest rates later this year," said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 242,000 for the week ended June 8, the highest level since last August, the Labour Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 claims in the latest week. It was the third straight weekly rise in claims, leading some economists to believe that cracks were forming in the labour market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others blamed the rise on lingering volatility related to the Memorial Day holiday in late May. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of Tencent-backed QuantumPharm, also known as XtalPi, on Thursday surged during its trading debut in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It marks the first initial public offering (IPO) under the Hong Kong stock exchange's Chapter 18C listing regime which allows specialist technology companies with a minimum valuation of HK$10 billion to sell shares, even if they haven't generated profits yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shares of the artificial intelligence drug researcher closed at HK$5.8, nearly 10 percent above its IPO price of HK$5.28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Public investors oversubscribed the offer by 102 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the listing ceremony, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Chapter 18C listing regime could facilitate financing for tech companies in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said Hong Kong’s role as an international financial centre enables it to attract global capital which in turn supports technology development in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, described the listing as a significant milestone in the city's market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added it showcased China’s leading role in the innovation and technology field and Hong Kong's appeal as a global financing hub for the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to the listing, Image Frame, a Tencent subsidiary, had a stake of about 13 percent in the newly-listed company.

    HKMA tracks Fed's decision and keeps rate steady

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The HKMA says the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757245_2_20240613115320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday left its base rate unchanged at 5.75 percent, tracking a decision by the US Federal Reserve to keep its key lending rate steady.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the benchmark interest rate between 5.25 and 5.5 percent, and said there is likely to be only one cut, of a quarter of a percentage point, this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an online press call, Mackie Lau, Standard Chartered's co-Head of Treasury Markets in Greater China, North Asia and Hong Kong, said the Fed's decision to keep the rate unchanged was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said there is no rush for the Fed to start cutting rates, as there are indications of resilience in the US economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the Fed's perspective, I think they do want to see inflation completely under control, and they would take a lot more comfort to act when the time comes. So I think at this juncture, the market is kind of expecting the first cut to come in September. That is very much in line with the dot plot that was released last night," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said that with recent economic data showing mixed signs and inflation remaining high, it's uncertain when the Fed will start cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that Hong Kong's financial and monetary markets continue to operate in a smooth and orderly manner, and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remains stable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading local banks, including HSBC, Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Standard Chartered, announced they were keeping their rates unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Sze-kei, Head of Wealth Strategy and Insights Division at Bank of China (Hong Kong), said the Fed's decision to maintain its interest rates was to prevent a sharp rebound in US inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung explained that while inflation in the US had been on a downward trajectory, the local job market and economy displayed strength, demonstrating resilience in inflationary pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, Cheung said the Fed had adopted a prudent approach in managing interest rates.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Xinhua commentary says the EU should embrace competition as an impetus for its own development. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757238_1_20240613112719.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry has urged the European Commission to stop turning trade into a political issue and avoid harming mutual trust between China and the European Union, as shares in Chinese automakers ended on a mostly positive note on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The comment from the Foreign Ministry came as the European Commission announced it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported electric cars from China starting in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will take all necessary measures to counter these actions, spokesperson Lin Jian told a news conference in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency had earlier said the move by the EU violates the rights and interests of the nation's EV industry and wreaks havoc on the global automotive supply chain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a commentary published late on Wednesday, Xinhua said "the EU's justification for these tariffs are based on claims of unfair competition due to so-called 'distortive' Chinese government subsidies. However, this claim is nothing but a thinly veiled excuse for protectionism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after Washington announced plans to quadruple duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would combat excessive subsidies with additional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes as European automakers are being challenged by an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. Still, there's virtually no support for tariffs from the European auto industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German automakers in particular are heavily dependent on sales in China and fear retribution from Beijing. European auto firms also import their own Chinese-made vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xinhua commentary continued by saying the EU should instead "embrace this competition as an impetus for its own development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that rather than imposing tariffs, the EU should seek collaborative solutions that benefit all parties involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, shares in BYD shot up more than five percent on Thursday on the Hang Seng Index, where carmakers NIO and Geely also ended the day 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent higher. SAIC was down more than 1.5 percent in Shanghai. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted record closing highs for a third straight day on Wednesday after inflation data came in softer than expected but the indexes ended off the day's highs as the Federal Reserve projected only one interest rate cut this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fed's March projections included three quarter-percentage-point reductions. The US central bank, in a statement at the end of its June 11-12 meeting, also said it left its policy rate unchanged, as expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks were choppy following the news and press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq paring gains late and the Dow finishing near flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks opened higher after the Labour Department reported that the US Consumer Price Index was unexpectedly unchanged in May due to cheaper gasoline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The CPI number was certainly cooler than estimates and drove optimism to start the day but that was only half of today's menu," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James said he would have expected the market to end weaker after the Fed's update, noting that "the commentary was hawkish and rate cut (expectations) were trimmed from three to one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oracle shares jumped 13.3 percent, lifting the market, after the software provider forecast double-digit revenue in fiscal 2025 after the bell on Tuesday.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just after the CPI report, traders boosted bets for a Fed rate cut by September and another by December.

    Fed holds rates, expects one cut this year

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Fed says interest rate cuts may have to wait until December. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757188_1_20240613021431.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and pushed out the start of rate cuts to perhaps as late as December, with officials projecting only a single quarter-percentage-point reduction for the year amid rising estimates for what it will take to keep inflation in check.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The markdown in the outlook for rate cuts, from three quarter-percentage-point reductions seen in the Fed's March projections, was made despite the central bank's acknowledgement in its new policy statement of "modest further progress" towards its 2 percent inflation target – an upgrade from its May 1 statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It coincided with an increase to 2.8 percent in the estimated long-run, or "neutral," rate of interest, from 2.6 percent, which indicates policymakers have concluded the economy needs more restraint in order to finish the battle against rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent progress has been slow, and Fed officials now project a slightly higher end-of-year inflation rate of 2.6 percent versus the 2.4 percent anticipated as of March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rate cuts are now seen getting a likely later start and a slower pace this year than investors have anticipated, the Fed's policy rate is seen falling fast next year, with reductions of a full percentage point in both 2025 and 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement and new Summary of Economic Projections show a central bank wrestling over how to respond to data that many read as pointing to slower inflation –consumer prices in fact did not rise at all in May on a month-over-month basis, according to data released on Wednesday – but also to steady growth and job creation.

    Beijing rebukes additional EU tariffs on Chinese EVs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China vowed to protect its interests if the EU goes ahead with its tariffs on Chinese EVs. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757113_1_20240612162215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday criticised additional European Union tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), saying the move violated market economy principles and international trade rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  MOFA spokesperson Lin Jian said any additional tariffs on Chinese EVs would eventually undermine the EU's own interests, adding Beijing would take all necessary measures to protect its lawful rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's comments came ahead of an announcement by the European Commission that it would apply additional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after the United States quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would set tariffs of 17.4 percent for BYD, 20 percent for Geely and 38.1 percent for SAIC over what it said were excessive subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU provisional duties are set to apply by July 4, with an anti-subsidy investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could apply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Margaritis Schinas, a European Commission vice president, told a news conference that Chinese-built cars were benefiting from unfair levels of subsidies, threatening EU producers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On this basis the Commission has reached out to Chinese authorities to discuss these findings and explore possible ways for resolving the issues identified," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China is strongly dissatisfied with the European plan to impose provisional duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, saying the move ignored facts and World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said Beijing will resolutely take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese companies. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said a tie-up between a government-owned investment vehicle and a local tech unicorn will add momentum to Hong Kong's securities market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Corporation has signed a cooperation deal with SmartMore, a technology company specialising in artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The collaboration between Hong Kong Corporation and SmartMore is a good starting point for advancing Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry towards a brighter future," Chan said in a speech at the signing ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the upcoming months, the Hong Kong Investment Corporation will continue to announce more strategic partnerships and actively pursue direct investments and joint investment projects. These projects will encompass various fields, including life sciences, green technology, and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said Hong Kong spent HK$30.1 billion on research and development in 2022, up from HK$21.3 billion in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that there were 4,250 tech startups in Hong Kong last year.

    Segantii insider dealing case moved to District Court

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An insider trading case against Asian hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its British founder Simon Sadler and a former trader has been moved to the District Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Eastern Magistrates' Court approved the prosecution’s request to transfer the case to a higher court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next hearing is scheduled to take place at the District Court on July 2, the court ruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum prison term a district court judge can impose is seven years, versus two to three years for the magistrate's court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case marks a turning point for one of Asia's biggest and oldest hedge funds as well as a step toward heightened scrutiny of trading activities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said last month it had started criminal proceedings against Segantii, its founder and chief investment officer Sadler and former trader Daniel La Rocca on suspicion of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company before a block trade in June 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accusation relates to insider information about Hong Kong-listed fashion chain Esprit Holdings, the court readout revealed, adding Segantii received the information from Tony Psarianos, a person connected to Esprit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psarianos was an investment banker at Merrill Lynch from 2007 to 2021, according to SFC licence records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, dubbed Asia's "block trade king", is also the owner of his home-town soccer team, Blackpool Football Club. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's consumer inflation measure rose at a steady pace in May while producer price declines narrowed slightly. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757051_1_20240612103958.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation held steady in May while producer price declines eased, but the underlying trend suggests Beijing would need to do more to prop up weakened domestic demand and an uneven economic recovery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in May from a year earlier, matching a gain in April, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slide in the producer price index eased to 1.4 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, compared with a forecast 1.5 percent decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's economy has struggled to gain traction despite the end of stringent pandemic curbs in late 2022, mainly due to the ripple effects of a prolonged property sector crisis on investor, business and consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has rolled out several measures to spur demand in the housing sector and launched other schemes to boost consumer sentiment, including offering government-subsidised incentives to spur trade-ins of cars and other consumer goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also vowed to create more jobs linked to major projects, roll out measures to promote domestic demand targeted for youths and has pledged greater fiscal stimulus to shore up growth. (Reuters)

    Apple pushes S&amp;P, Nasdaq to record highs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered record closing highs for a second straight day on Tuesday, helped by a gain of more than 7 percent in Apple shares, while investors also awaited consumer prices data and a policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apple shares jumped 7.3 percent to a record-high close and gave the S&P 500 and Nasdaq their biggest boosts after the stock declined in the previous session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At its annual developer event that kicked off on Monday, Apple unveiled new artificial-intelligence features meant to increase the appeal of its devices, including an improved Siri virtual assistant that can answer a wider range of queries and accomplish more complicated tasks than earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 technology index climbed 1.7 percent and also posted a record closing high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Price Index report will be released before the bell on Wednesday, and the US central bank's policy announcement is due later the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank is likely to leave interest rates unchanged but will release its updated economic projections and "dot plot," which shows where policymakers expect interest rates to stand this year and longer-term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everybody is feeling uneasy, but the data and actions consumers are taking continue to point toward resiliency, and that tends to be overall fairly bullish," said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and adviser for Wealthspire Advisors in Westport, Connecticut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.31 percent, to 38,747, the S&P 500 gained  0.27 percent, to 5,375 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.88 percent, to 17,344.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  General Motors gained 1.35 percent after the carmaker announced a US$6 billion share buyback plan. GM also cut its annual EV production forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the closing bell, Oracle shares rose 8 percent following the release of quarterly results. The stock ended the regular session down 0.5 percent. (Reuters)

 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Monday eked out record closing highs, although investors were cautious ahead of this week's consumer prices report, a Federal Reserve policy announcement and Apple's developer conference.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Providing some support to the Nasdaq and S&P 500, Nvidia shares ended up 0.7 percent, the session after a 10-for-one stock split. Some investors now believe the chip-maker might be included in the blue-chip Dow.

  The Consumer Price Index report for May is due on Wednesday, along with the conclusion of the Fed's two-day policy meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank, which will release updated economic and policy projections, is expected to hold interest rates steady. Investors will look for clues on when the US central bank may begin to cut interest rates.

  The Dow Jones rose 0.18 percent to 38,868, the S&P 500 gained 0.26 percent to 5,360, and the Nasdaq added 0.35 percent to 17,192. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The euro recoiled on Monday after a far-right surge in weekend EU polls sparked a general election in France, although analysts believe the single currency will remain resilient.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shared eurozone unit was down 0.3 percent at US$1.0736 around 1415 GMT, while the Paris CAC 40 stocks index slumped 1.9 percent in shock over President Emmanuel Macron's election call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors fretted over the region's political "shift to the Far Right," as well as the "surprise factor" of a snap general election in France, according to XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron announced on Sunday that he was dissolving the National Assembly, or French Parliament's lower house, after news that far-right parties including National Rally (NR) took almost 40 percent of the French vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NR is led by 28-year-old leader Jordan Bardella, whose mentor is Marine Le Pen – runner-up in the last two presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France will vote for a new National Assembly on June 30 with a second round scheduled on July 7, two years after Macron failed to clinch an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The euro took a hit as investors fretted that political turmoil could hurt Macron's agenda in in France, which was a key founding member of the eurozone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The prospect of a parliament controlled by Le Pen and Bardella with Macron as president, could thwart Macron's plans for much-needed economic reforms in France that could have eased concerns about... debt," said Brooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those concerns were brought into sharp focus after Standard and Poor's recently downgraded France's long-term sovereign debt rating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Added to the mix, the July election could deliver a far-right prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The likelihood (is) that parliamentary elections in France will result in a PM from another party," said Rabobank analyst Jane Foley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This would change the direction of French politics including the agenda with respect to fiscal policy and potentially for issues such as EU enlargement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increasing popularity of far-right parties has also stoked concerns over rising euroscepticism in the continent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going forward, commentators warn that could further weigh on the euro, which was created in 1999 as a key means of bringing the continent closer together. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said a government-owned investment vehicle will sign a cooperation deal on Wednesday with a local "tech unicorn" – a start-up company worth more than US$1 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan did not name the company concerned, but said it operated in the artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the tie-up with Hong Kong Investment Corporation will help the business expand research and development investment here, as well as fund training of staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said the deal would help the company roll out the use of its AI models in the Greater Bay Area and speed up digital transformation in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the purpose of the corporation is to help promote innovation and technology in Hong Kong by attracting enterprises and professionals with high potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the number of tech start-ups in the city exceeded 4,250 last year.

    US stocks finish lower after choppy session

    <![CDATA[<img alt="For the week, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 percent, the Nasdaq rose 2.38 percent, and the Dow added 0.29 percent. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756581_1_20240608045238.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks ended slightly lower on Friday in choppy trading after stronger-than-expected US jobs data pointed to a robust economy but prompted worries the Federal Reserve may wait longer to cut interest rates than many investors had hoped.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy generated about 272,000 jobs in May, far more than the 185,000 analysts had forecast, according to a Labour Department report. The unemployment rate inched up to 4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The benchmark S&P 500 slipped immediately after the report while US Treasury yields climbed as traders slashed bets on a September rate reduction. The index recovered and briefly hit a fresh intraday record high as investors noted the data pointed to underlying economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It finished slightly lower, with the utilities, materials, and communication services stocks among the biggest drag. Financials and technology advanced ahead of others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the week, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 percent, the Nasdaq rose 2.38 percent, and the Dow added 0.29 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This tells you there's certainly not going to a cut in the short term, and with the bond yields going back up it's putting a lot of pressure on the risk-on trade, which is probably small caps," said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's just a function of interest rates and maybe a little higher for longer, and people have to recalibrate for that type of environment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a 56 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Investors will eye US inflation data next week and the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which ends on June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one expects the Fed to cut (rates next week), but will they open the door for a cut as soon as September is the big question on everyone's mind," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, adding he still sees a September reduction on the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.22 percent, to 38,798, the S&P 500 lost 0.11 percent, to 5,346 and the Nasdaq lost 0.23 percent, to 17,133.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop slumped 39 percent in volatile trading just as stock influencer "Roaring Kitty" kicked off his first livestream in three years. The gaming retailer had announced a potential stock offering and a drop in quarterly sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other so-called meme stocks, including AMC Entertainment and Koss Corp, fell 15.1 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia slipped, on track to extend the previous session's losses, with its valuation again dipping below the US$3 trillion mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lyft shares rose 0.6 percent, following a forecast of 15 percent annual growth in its gross bookings through 2027 after markets closed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 1,177 stocks rose and 3,064 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.6-to-1 ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 149 new lows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total volume of shares traded across US exchanges was about 10.75 billion, compared with the 12.7 billion average over the last 20 trading days. (Reuters)

    US hiring and wage growth picked up last month

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden says the jobs report is a sign of the economy’s robust health. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756572_1_20240608011135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 America’s employers added a strong 272,000 jobs in May, accelerating from April and a sign that companies are still confident enough in the economy to keep hiring despite persistently high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last month’s sizeable job gain suggests that the economy is still growing steadily, propelled by consumer spending on travel, entertainment and other services. US airports, for example, reported near-record traffic over the Memorial Day weekend. A healthy job market typically drives consumer spending, the economy’s principal fuel. Though some recent signs had raised concerns about economic weakness, May’s jobs report should help assuage those fears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, Friday's report from the government included some signs of a potential slowdown. The unemployment rate, for example, edged up for a second straight month, to a still-low 4 percent, from 3.9 percent, ending a 27-month streak of unemployment below 4 percent. That streak had matched the longest such run since the late 1960s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden pointed to Friday's jobs report as a sign of the economy’s robust health under his administration. He also charged that congressional Republicans would worsen inflation by cutting health care subsidies and widening the deficit through tax cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has focused his criticism of Biden’s economic policies on the surge in inflation , which polls show still weighs heavily in voters’ assessment of the economy. At a rally in Phoenix on Thursday, he blamed illegal immigration for contributing to higher prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists say the mixed signals from Friday's report – a surge in jobs alongside a slight rise in unemployment – are likely a sign that the job market is normalising after years of distortions related to the pandemic. After the brutal pandemic recession, when unemployment rocketed to nearly 15 percent, hiring soared in 2022 and 2023 as the economy quickly recovered. Wages, before adjusting for inflation, also jumped as businesses desperately sought to fill jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of open jobs, while still elevated, has fallen to a three-year low, the government said this week. Fewer workers are quitting their jobs, after quits had soared after the pandemic. Many employers say it's become easier to find workers to fill their open jobs. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports grew more quickly and for a second month in May, suggesting factory owners are managing to find buyers overseas and providing some relief to the economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 7.6 percent year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Friday, beating a forecast 6 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 1.5 percent rise seen in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports increased 1.8 percent in May, slowing from an 8.4 percent jump in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over recent months, a flurry of data has shown different parts of the US$18.6 trillion economy recovering at varying speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While first quarter growth blew past forecasts and strong March export and output data suggested improving global demand might aid officials' efforts to get the economy back on a more even keel, recent indicators have reflected domestic consumption had softened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A protracted property sector crisis remains the biggest drag on China's economy, with low investor and consumer confidence hurting domestic consumption and undermining business activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Friday's trade data should give authorities some breathing space as they continue their efforts to foster a broad-based economic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund last month upgraded its China growth forecast for 2024 in line with Beijing's growth target of "around" five percent, but warned of risks to the economy from the property troubles. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were little changed on Thursday after hitting records a day earlier, as traders awaited data on the labour market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones inched up 0.2 percent to 38,886, while the S&P 500 ended flat at 5,352.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 17,173.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached new highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not uncommon. It seems like every time the market makes a new high, there is not a lot of follow through," said Karl Haeling of LBBW.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market movements also came after the European Central Bank lowered interest rates for the first time since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haeling noted that although the ECB cut was anticipated, its tone was "less dovish than expected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All attention is now on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, as traders look for signs that the US central bank may soon follow suit in reducing interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, traders are looking ahead to the latest US employment report due out on Friday indicating the health of the labour market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While hiring has proven more resilient than anticipated in the face of high interest rates, cooling job growth could prompt the Fed to lower rates sooner rather than later.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US trade deficit expanded slightly less than analysts expected in April, to the widest since late 2022, as imports rose more quickly than exports, according to government data released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overall gap was US$74.6 billion, growing from March's revised US$68.6 billion figure, said the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the largest deficit since October 2022, according to official data.

  US consumption has been more resilient than anticipated even as the central bank rapidly hiked interest rates to dampen demand – and this has helped to support imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with weaker global demand, there have been concerns that export growth would not be able to keep up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors are also watching the Federal Reserve for the outcome of its policy meeting next week, looking for hints on when it might start cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The early data are pointing to a drag from trade in the second quarter," said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, imports grew by 2.4 percent to US$338.2 billion, while exports rose by 0.8 percent to US$263.7 billion, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jump in imports was largely due to an increase in goods such as automotive vehicles, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goods exports, meanwhile, also picked up but by a smaller degree, with a rise seen in products like pharmaceutical preparations and electric apparatus, data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Imports have been supported by strong domestic demand and lean inventories," said Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exports have contended with a weaker global backdrop and a strong US dollar which makes domestic goods relatively more expensive abroad," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goods deficit with China dropped by US$2.5 billion to US$22.1 billion in April. This was mainly due to a decrease in imports. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index pushed to new highs on Wednesday. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756277_1_20240606034443.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs on Wednesday, powered mainly by technology stocks as markets digested economic data that could support a much-expected start to the Federal Reserve's policy easing cycle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to end at 5,354, the Nasdaq Composite gained just under two percent to 17,187. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 percent to 38,807.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The May private payrolls report on Wednesday became the latest data to suggest an easing in labour market tightness that could propel the Fed to begin cutting rates this year. A report on Tuesday showed job openings fell in April to the fewest in more than three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're seeing the economic data starting to ease up a little bit and the repercussions for that is that you're seeing the pressure on rates come off the boil a little bit mixed in with the potential for weaker economic data, which is a pretty good recipe for the bond market," said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a nearly 69 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Expectations had hovered around 50 percent last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US 10-year Treasury yields fell to a two-month low on Wednesday after a report pointed to weaker-than-expected job growth ahead of Friday's highly anticipated government employment report for May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip stocks leapt, buoyed by gains to Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which both touched record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hewlett Packard Enterprise rose after forecasting third-quarter revenue above Street expectations, helped by upbeat demand for its AI servers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel gained after buyout firm Apollo Global Management agreed to purchase 49 percent for US$11 billion in a joint venture related to the chipmaker's Ireland manufacturing unit. (Reuters)

    Lawsuit says Google parent abused its position

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Google has urged Britain's competition watchdog to block a lawsuit that accuses the tech giant of abusing its position. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756264_1_20240605234046.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google parent Alphabet must face a lawsuit worth up to 13.6 billion pounds for allegedly abusing its dominance in the online advertising market, London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit, which seeks damages on behalf of publishers of websites and apps based in the United Kingdom, is the latest case to focus on the search giant's business practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action is bringing the claim on behalf of publishers who say they have suffered losses due to Google's allegedly anti-competitive behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google last month urged the CAT to block the case, which it argued was incoherent. The company "strongly rejects the underlying allegations", its lawyers said in court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CAT said in a written ruling that it would certify the case to proceed towards a trial, which is unlikely to take place before the end of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tribunal also emphasised the test for certifying a case under the UK's collective proceedings regime – which is roughly equivalent to the United States' class action regime – is relatively low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Google works constructively with publishers across the UK and Europe," Google legal director Oliver Bethell said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bethell added: "This lawsuit is speculative and opportunistic. We'll oppose it vigorously and on the facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Claudio Pollack, a partner of Ad Tech Collection Action, said: "This is a decision of major importance to the victims of Google's anti-competitive conduct in ad tech. Google will now have to answer for its practices in a full trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action's case comes amid ongoing probes by regulators into Google's adtech business, including by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the European Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google is also fighting two lawsuits in the United States, one brought by the Department of Justice and another by Texas and other states, accusing the company of anti-competitive conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google's lawyers said in documents for the CAT case that the company's "impact in the ad tech industry has been hugely pro-competitive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wednesday's decision is the latest against a tech giant to be given the green light by the CAT, which already this year has certified a US$3.8 billion case against Facebook parent Meta and a nearly US$1 billion case against Apple. (Reuters)

    'Wealth connect scheme could be widened further'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, says they are looking into further upgrading the cross-border Wealth Connect Scheme. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756167_1_20240605125906.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Eddie Yue on Wednesday said authorities are looking into the feasibility of further widening a wealth connect scheme to attract large sums of capital from the Greater Bay Area to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a wealth summit, Yue noted that the city’s de facto central bank upgraded the “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme” to a 2.0 version in February, to cover a greater variety of investment products and enabling more mainland investors to trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue said the authorities are now studying whether the scheme can be upgraded to a 3.0 version, so the city can better cater to private banking customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s still in the early days, [but] we are talking to the industry very closely about what's needed. Is it the quota? Or is it the scope of products? Or is it the selling process?” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, the quota. Currently, the individual quota is up to three million renminbi, but that's actually not quite enough for private bank clients. Is there a way to have a separate channel to capture the private bank clients?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The selling process has been a lot easier and smoother than before. But can it be further streamlined? Or can the marketing be made more active? Can the education be done better? I think there are still areas that we can look into in terms of improvements,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue added that a significant increase in capital inflows from the north to the SAR was observed following the previous upgrade, and indicated that a further expansion could potentially attract more middle-class investors in the development zone who have the greatest need to diversify their assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme, launched in September 2021, was Beijing’s first tailor-made plan to boost sales and capital flows between Hong Kong, Macau and the nine other cities in the Greater Bay Area.

    Wall Street up as jobs data boosts rates hope

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended a shade higher on Tuesday following softer-than-expected labor market data that reaffirmed expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Tuesday showed that US job openings fell to their lowest level in more than three years in April, signaling an easing in labour market tightness that supported a Fed rate cut this year. The US Treasury yields slipped following the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's main indexes gained ground after paring earlier loses. Equities in real estate and consumer staples sectors advanced ahead of others, while materials and energy stocks were the biggest losers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The labour market data was the latest in a string of recent reports that pointed to cooling US economic growth. Data on Monday showed that US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we've seen in the data so far this week is that it's been relatively weak, starting with manufacturing PMI and job openings today," said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in Santa Monica, California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That has had a total effect of helping the rally in the bond market; but for the stock market, it's a double-edged sword because they're looking for a rate cut announcement, which has a rising probability with weaker data," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.36 percent, to 38,711, the S&P 500 gained 0.15 percent, to 5,291 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.17 percent, to 16,857.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacap technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, ended higher after losing ground early in the session. Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron fell 1.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, as demand concerns weighed on crude prices.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wen Shuhao, chairman of QuantumPharm (centre), says the introduction of the Chapter 18C rule shows the SAR's capital markets value the technology sector. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756023_1_20240604124200.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland artificial intelligence drug research firm QuantumPharm on Tuesday said it plans to raise up to HK$1.13 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), as it becomes the first company to take advantage of a new rule designed to entice technology firms to list in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Tencent-backed firm, also known as XtalPi, is offering 187.37 million shares, 95 percent of which will be issued internationally and five percent of which will be issued in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price range of the shares will be between HK$5.03 and HK$6.03, with an “entry fee” of HK$6,091. Trading will begin on June 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The listing is under the Chapter 18C rule introduced by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in March last year, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies with a valuation of at least HK$10 billion are allowed to sell shares in IPOs even if they are yet to generate revenue. For firms that have generated revenue, the valuation threshold is reduced to HK$6 billion if they had at least HK$250 million in sales in the financial year prior to their IPO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the firm’s chairman, Wen Shuhao, said the introduction of Chapter 18C shows the city’s capital markets value the technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company plans to bring in eight cornerstone investors with a combined contribution of nearly HK$338 million to subscribe for the shares, including Peter Lee, the chairman of Henderson Land Development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronald Tam, QuantumPharm's chief financial officer, said he believes the Shenzhen-headquartered firm will be able to generate profits in the near term, despite seeing losses over the past three financial years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chapter 18C rule applies to applicants in high-tech, advanced hardware and software, new materials, new energy, as well as food and agriculture technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only other firm which has applied to list under the rule so far is Black Sesame International Holding, which produces chips for autonomous driving.

 S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged higher in a choppy session on Monday amid soft manufacturing sector data and as a glitch on the NYSE briefly caused trading halts in dozens of equities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange had triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold. Trading in at least 60 NYSE-listed stocks was halted due to the volatility, before the bourse fixed the technical issue and activity resumed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished higher after paring earlier losses on the sesson, while the Dow lost ground. Technology stocks were the biggest gainers, while energy equities were the biggest drag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets had weighed data showing US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month, raising concerns of weakening economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of those days where people are waiting for the next catalyst with a choppy move after earnings," said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's bit of a tug of war between the market seeing weakening data and the expectation that the Fed may cut rates," Lerner added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.30 percent, to 38,571, the S&P 500 gained 0.11 percent, to 5,283 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.56 percent, to 16,829.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia rose 4.9 percent after CEO Jensen Huang revealed that the company's next-generation AI chip platform would be rolled out in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of other megacaps, including Apple, Amazon , Alphabet, and Meta closed higher. Microsoft and Tesla finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop soared 21 percent after a weekend Reddit post from stocks influencer Keith Gill, also known as "Roaring Kitty", showed a US$116 million bet on the gaming retailer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will be eyeing a data-packed week that includes surveys on the services sector, factory orders and Friday's closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, which could provide clues to the Fed's likely course of action with regards to rates. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold, and trading halts in dozens of other companies on Monday, before the bourse fixed the problem.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange, by late morning said on its website it had resolved a reported technical issue and that the impacted stocks had resumed trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 60 stocks listed on the NYSE were halted due to volatility and some stocks showed unusual outsized movements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold shares were shown to be down 99.97 percent and 98.54 percent, respectively, due to the technical issue, before those trades were corrected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NYSE said the problem was related to Limit Up-Limit Down bands meant to prevent extraordinary market volatility and extreme price movements in individual stock by preventing trades outside of specific price ranges that are updated throughout the trading day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price band for each security is set at a percentage level above and below its average price in the preceding five-minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bands were developed as part of the response by financial regulators and exchanges to the "flash crash" of 2010, which wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in market capitalisation in a few minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Technical issues on exchanges can hit markets, impact traders' confidence and attract scrutiny from regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think the overall market is reacting," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. (Reuters)
