<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Monday, extending a rally from late last week ahead of a Federal Reserve decision and key earnings reports in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A news-jammed week includes Wednesday's Fed decision, where the central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but will update investors on the prospects for cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will also digest April jobs data, as well as surveys measuring manufacturing sector health and consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This week has something for everyone," said a note from Charles Schwab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones advanced 0.4 percent to 38,386.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 5,116, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 15,983.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple, Coca-Cola and Pfizer are among the large companies reporting quarterly earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies in the S&P 500 have thus reported an average of 3.5 percent higher earnings compared with the year-ago period, according to Factset.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Tesla shot up nearly 15 percent after receiving a key security clearance from the Chinese government for smart cars during a visit to China by Chief Executive Elon Musk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple gained 2.7 percent following an upgrade from equity analysts at Bernstein.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Domino's Pizza jumped 5.6 percent as it reported a 6.1 percent increase in first-quarter sales to US$4.4 billion. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan says first quarter economic growth is expected to fall within the 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent range. Photo courtesy of the secretary's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750893_1_L_20240428120932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.

    Alphabet, Microsoft power gains on Wall Street

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street closed higher, particularly technology stocks. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750769_1_L_20240427042348.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 38,239, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent to 5,099, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.0 percent to 15,927.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its US$70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above US$2 trillion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft shares rose after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services. On Wednesday, Meta results had disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins," said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing," Plumb added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692 percent  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Snap surged after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest shares also finished higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exxon Mobil lost ground after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel dropped after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data centre and PC chips. (Reuters)

    Inflation indicator may delay expected US rate cut

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest personal consumption expenditures price index may push back an expected interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750764_1_L_20240427022105.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank's favoured measure of inflation accelerated last month, according to government data published on Friday, pushing back the chances of an interest rate cut this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hotter print is likely to cement the view that inflation, while down sharply since 2022, remains a challenge, and could keep the Federal Reserve on pause as it seeks to battle rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also complicates US president Joe Biden's re-election message as he seeks to convince sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in March, up 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was above the median forecast of 2.6 percent in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the overall annual rise came from the services sector, which increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the more volatile items, energy prices rose by 2.6 percent from a year ago, while food prices were up 1.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While inflation has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak, today's report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down," White House national economic advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, PCE inflation rose by 0.3 percent, in line with the figure from February, the Commerce Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closely watched "core" measure of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in March, unchanged from a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The March figures reaffirm the concern among economists that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than previously thought -- complicating the Federal Reserve's fight to bring it down firmly to its long-term target of two percent through interest rate hikes. (AFP)

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

    <![CDATA[<img alt="ByteDance has denied reports saying it had considered selling TikTok. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750683_1_L_20240426154425.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices rebounded in March, rising one percent month-on-month and ending a 10-month falling streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department showed that the official private flat price index edged up to 305.7, from 302.5 in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, prices were still more than 13 percent lower on a yearly basis and 23 percent lower than the all-time high recorded in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents also edged up in March, rising 0.5 percent on a monthly basis, or 5.6 percent on an annual basis, following a two-month falling streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases came after the government lifted all remaining property cooling measures in the budget in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The city’s property market has seen a revenge-style rebound after the lifting of the cooling measures, as the buyers’ sentiment noticeably improved,” said Martin Wong, director and head of research & consultancy, Greater China, at Knight Frank Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “However, prices of lived-in homes may continue to weaken due to the impact of sales of new homes. And as the interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve may also come later than the markets anticipated, meaning the city may start cutting rates from late third quarter, the high rates may continue weighing on the market.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong, struck a cautious note on the property price outlook due to surging supplies and an uncertain path for interest rate cuts, saying she expects a five to 10 percent fall over the year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street had a weak session, though extended trading lifted some tech giants. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750596_1_L_20240426050729.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected US economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Thursday showed that the US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11 percent, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8 percent in extended hours trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 percent, to 38,086, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 percent, to 5,048 and the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 15,612.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labour market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Business Machines fell 8 percent after it announced a US$6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southwest Airlines slid nearly 7 percent as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time. Caterpillar shed 7 percent after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.

    New tools needed to reduce FX risks: ABAC

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The benchmark S&P 500 closed higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, as investors weighed an uptick in Treasury yields amid positive corporate results particularly from technology giants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An auction of a record US$70 billion worth of five-year US Treasury notes on Wednesday helped to push bond yields higher and had weighed on equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose five basis points to 4.6459 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow finished lower while the Nasdaq ended higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also focused on quarterly earnings from companies, especially from megacap growth stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms fell 11 percent in extended hours trading after the tech giant reported that its capital expenditure could reach up to US$40 billion in 2024, even as its first quarter revenue beat estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their results later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 12 percent after the electric vehicle maker's plans to boost production and roll out more affordable models overshadowed its weak quarterly results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My biggest concern is the bond market, particularly the long end of the US yield curve," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.02 percent to 5,072 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.10 percent, to 15,713. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, to 38,461.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are eyeing first quarter gross domestic product data on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March on Friday. Hotter-than-expected consumer price inflation report for March had pushed back expectations of when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.

    HKEX sees profit drop 13pc in Q1

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday reported a 13 percent annual decline in its net profit in the first quarter of this year, as lower turnover weighed on fees, while fewer listings eroded revenues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the city’s bourse showed the group’s profit stood at HK$2.97 billion for the first three months of the year, compared with the HK$3.4 billion seen in the same period a year ago when economic activities rebounded after Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue and other income also declined, dropping 6 percent year on year to HK$5.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declines came as average daily trading turnover dropped 22 percent year on year to HK$99.4 billion, while listing fees fell 25 percent year on year following the reduction in the number of new listings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the lower income was partially offset by strong derivatives trading, record quarterly high turnover in the Northbound Stock Connect, as well as increased trades at its subsidiary, the London Metal Exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year,” said the group’s newly appointed chief executive Bonnie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Despite a fragile global backdrop, the group’s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly - the former achieving record quarterly volume,” she said, adding there was a notable increase in daily trading volume in March and April, indicating growing confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX’s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fast-growing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond,” Chan said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  General Electric, Spotify Technology and Kimberly-Clark were among the companies winning strong gains after quarterly reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com described the broad gains as "follow-through buying" after a rough period that generated talk that the market was "oversold" on a short-term basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,503.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent to 5,070, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6 percent to 15,696.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After last week's losses, US stocks began the week on Monday on a solid note, advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, General Motors shot up 4.4 percent as it lifted its full-year forecast following better than expected quarterly earnings. The automaker continued to point to solid pricing in the United States, which helped offset weakness in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GE Aerospace gained 8.3 percent after lifting its projections after reporting an uptick in orders and operating profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But JetBlue sank 18.9 percent as it projected lower revenues in the second quarter, noting that there is "significant elevated capacity" in the company's Latin region, pressuring results. (AFP)

    London's FTSE strikes record as global sentiment lifts

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the US dollar. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750239_1_L_20240423235344.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's FTSE 100 stocks index hit record highs on Tuesday, catching up with major global peers that have struck all-time peaks this year as inflation cools.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sentiment was upbeat across major world indices thanks to easing Middle East worries and hopes of interest-rate cuts, while traders are keenly awaiting the release this week of more major earnings and key US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London's FTSE 100 reached 8,076 points shortly after the open, surpassing a record 8,047 struck in February last year, though it pared down gains in afternoon deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good news as this is, it does highlight the sluggishness of the UK's top equity index when compared to its US and European competitors which hit a string of successive records throughout the first quarter of 2024," said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he added, "let's not be too churlish as it could be we see the FTSE outperform its rivals in the years to come should investors seek out dividend paying value stocks rather than techy growthy ones."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the dollar, as markets anticipate cuts to UK interest rates in the coming months thanks to slowing price rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A weaker pound benefits FTSE-listed British multinationals that make big earnings in foreign currencies. Sterling gained against the dollar and euro on Tuesday after falling earlier in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets won a lift from news of an improvement to business activity in the eurozone this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street opened higher on a busy week on the corporate front, with investors keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings from Elon Musk's Tesla later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electric car maker, which enjoyed scorching growth for most of 2022 and 2023, has experienced setbacks that analysts say have raised the stakes for the first-quarter report. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation rate slightly rose in March, with the Composite Consumer Price Index up two percent on a year earlier.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compared to the 1.9 percent inflation rate in the previous two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department showed that underlying inflation, stripping out short-term relief measures, was also up marginally in March, at one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcohol and tobacco prices surged nearly 18 percent year-on-year, while meals out and takeaways were up 3.3 percent and housing costs rose 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electricity, gas and water prices dropped 8.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the underlying price inflation was “modest” in March, noting that prices of basic foods edged down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay contained in the near term. Domestic costs may face some upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad downward trend, though heightened geopolitical tensions will bring uncertainties,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first quarter of 2024, overall consumer prices rose 1.9 percent year-on-year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered higher on Monday, shrugging off recent weakness at the start of a heavy week of earnings from technology and industrial companies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The markets are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the tensions in the Middle East didn't escalate," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Friday, in part due to selling ahead of the weekend amid fears of a worsening in the Israel-Iran conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,239.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 5,010, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.1 percent to 15,451.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 finished in positive territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's earnings calendar includes results from tech titans such as Amazon and Microsoft, as well as from industrial companies including Chevron and General Motors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla, which also reports this week, fell 3.4 percent following another round of price cuts – the latest sign of intensifying competition among electric vehicle manufacturers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verizon dropped 4.6 percent as analysts cited worries about a soft demand picture, with net broadband subscriber additions slowing compared with the prior quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike slid 0.4 percent after disclosing to state officials in Oregon that it plans to cut 740 jobs from its headquarters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial analysts on Monday said that a pledge by the nation’s securities regulator to offer support in enhancing Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub can provide a short-term boost to market sentiment, but more measures are needed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shares on the Hang Seng Index and Tech Index enjoyed a bump after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Friday said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the measures, the scope of eligible exchange-traded funds (ETFs) via the links will be widened, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) will be included for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James Wong, chief executive of Cathaysia Securities, said the latest move by Beijing had brought a “positive atmosphere” to local stock markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the securities specialist cautioned that such measures may only help in the near future, and that it may take “many more policies” to really improve sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “All of these [measures] are good. But, for example, the number of ETFs that are allowed is less than 10. I really don't know how much capital flow that 10 ETFs can bring to the Hong Kong market,” he noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that there were only 12 initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the first quarter, and described the figure as “scary”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong expressed the hope that authorities will make it easier for mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia, said that Monday's rally came on the back of a combination of factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The sentiment has already improved over the past two months,” said Wen, noting that while the city’s bourse may be able to see more capital inflow following Beijing’s announcement, the “game changer” lies on fundamental factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It depends on many more factors, including China's economic development and whether the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June or July. These fundamental factors may be more important for foreign or mainland capital - whether they want to come to Hong Kong and buy Hong Kong stocks,” Wen said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq sank more than two percent on Friday following a poor investor response to Netflix earnings that exacerbated worries over next week's deluge of earnings from tech giants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 2.1 percent at 15,282, with Netflix sinking 9.1 percent and artificial intelligence leader Nvidia losing 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 percent to 37,986, and the S&P 500 declined 0.9 percent to 4,967.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netflix reported a profit of US$2.3 billion, topping earnings expectations on a jump in subscribers. The drop appeared to be tied to commentary about the current quarter which suggested growth was moderating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results come ahead of reports next week from other key tech names, including Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The way Netflix has responded has created some consternation about the mega stocks' ability to live up to expectations," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, who cited downcast comments from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company earlier in the week as a driver of Friday's poor showing by chip stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks have had a rough week due in part to unease over the Middle East and shifting expectations on US monetary policy, with traders betting the US central bank will delay cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other companies reporting results, American Express jumped 6.2 percent after reporting a 34 percent increase in quarterly profits to US$2.4 billion.

    Cybertruck recalled over accelerator pedal glitch

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cybertruck's use of large flat plates of unbent stainless steel poses challenges in manufacturing. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749694_1_L_20240420003055.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla is recalling 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles because of a defect that can cause unintentional vehicle acceleration, increasing crash risk, according to a US notice posted this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tesla notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on April 17 of the condition in which the accelerator pedal may become trapped on the Cybertruck, Elon Musk's futuristic take on the American pickup truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the accelerator pedal becomes trapped, "the performance and operation of the pedal will be affected, which may increase the risk of a collision," Tesla said in the notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla said it was not aware of any collisions or injuries related to the condition. The company will replace or rework the accelerator to address the issue, the company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has championed the Cybertruck, declaring at a launch event last November that "Finally, the future will look like the future!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the vehicle's use of large flat plates of unbent stainless steel poses challenges in manufacturing. Musk has said it will take time to ramp up production, targeting 2025 as the year when output will reach 250,000 a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Tesla announced it would lay off more than 10 percent of its global workforce as it contends with rising competition among electric vehicle producers and slowing demand growth in some markets. (AFP)

    Investors lured by the promise of golden returns

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gold is proving attractive once more to investors. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749569_1_L_20240419114002.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 When Vincent Yuan, a resident of Hebei province on the mainland, wanted to get something nice for his wife, he bought a piece of golden gourd jewellery, spending about 28,000 yuan at a local jewellery shop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There was also some strategic thinking behind the 35-year-old general manager’s decision, adding he bought the jewellery because he believes there’s real value to be gained from investing in the precious yellow metal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People like buying stuff which sees its value go up and not down, so if prices keep going up, we’ll of course buy more, and vice versa, if prices go down, then we won’t buy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gold is like a go-to preference for Chinese people,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His wife, Catrina Xu, 30, is also a fan of gold jewellery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a trip to Hong Kong last year, the only souvenir Xu purchased were gold items — a bracelet from a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui and a necklace when she visited Hong Kong Disneyland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since then, prices have gone up a lot over the past nine months,” she noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were among thousands of mainland Chinese shoppers who see the precious metal as a safe-haven investment to hedge against devaluation amid economic uncertainties as property prices in the country fall and its stock markets slump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since December last year, retail prices for gold from China’s major brands have risen 21 percent to a multi-year high of over 730 yuan (US$100) per gram as of April 12, from the 600 yuan (US$82) range seen in December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In New York, bullion prices notched another record close on April 15, with the most-active June contract for gold futures settling at US$2,383 per ounce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have been surprised by the strength in gold that we've seen since the start of 2024,” said John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bullion veteran said while the Chinese retail buying spree had been a major contributor to the global gold price spikes, other drivers included tensions in the Middle East, and speculative buyers on the Comex futures market in New York, which lifted prices higher over the past six weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comex is the leading platform for trading futures contracts on precious and base metals, such as gold, silver, and copper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is very much an emerging market phenomena led by China - together with speculative buying [on Comex].”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As has been the incredible purchases by central banks, which has been going on for nearly two years now," Reade said, noting that global central banks had ramped up their gold purchases in 2022 and 2023, to diversify their foreign reserves and reduce their dependency on US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the council's 2023 annual report, about one fourth of global central banks intend to increase their holdings of gold this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The People’s Bank of China, in particular, regained the crown for the largest single gold buyer in 2023, as it reported a total rise of 225 tonnes in its gold reserves over the year, marking its highest level of annual buying since at least 1977.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And all the indications are that it’s continued,” Reade added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American bank Citi on Tuesday forecast that gold is set to reach US$3,000 an ounce over the next six to 18 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lender noted the start of US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts - or a potential recession - would further drive demand for gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another financial giant, Goldman Sachs, last Friday referred to the “unshakeable bull market” in gold and upgraded its price target for the precious metal to US$2,700 an ounce by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would expect gold to benefit from interest rate cuts if and when they materialise in the United States and other important markets. That's likely to help gold performance,” Reade agreed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he cautioned that the metal tends to deliver returns that are only around three percent higher than US inflation in the long term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say US$3,000 an ounce over the next six to 18 months could be quite a stretch from where we are now… That said, there’s certainly the ingredients in place for the strength that we’ve seen in gold to continue for the next year or two,” adding that prices could still be volatile in the short term.

 Official data released on Friday showed that the number of bankruptcy petitions in March was at their highest since November last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Official Receiver's Office, there were 783 bankruptcy petitions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 L'Oreal's chief executive gave a cautious outlook about China, the world's No. 2 beauty market, on Thursday even after the cosmetics maker reported first-quarter sales growth of more than 6 percent for the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter performance in China was well above sector growth of 1 percent, Nicolas Hieronimus told analysts in a call after the French cosmetics giant that owns the Maybelline and Lancome brands released better-than-expected first-quarter sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, he is not banking on any major improvement in consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We plan with, I would say, a China that is not doing fantastic, and we make the most of the opportunities in Europe, in emerging (markets) and gaining share in North America," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And if China accelerates, it will be a positive news on our own expectations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demand for mass market products in China has accelerated during the quarter to a greater extent than in the United States, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The make-up market has slowed the most in North America, although fragrance is doing "great", he said in the call. (Reuters)

    US markets end down, as rate cut hopes dim

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street indices closed marginally lower, except for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which managed a slight gain. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749537_1_L_20240419031604.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Thursday after another volatile session as rising US Treasury bond yields reflected dimming hopes for an imminent pivot in the Fed's monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Price action feeds on itself," Karl Haeling of LBBW said of the lacklustre session. "People see the market going down and they say, 'Get me out.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.1 percent gain at 37,775.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,011, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 15,601.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market's current posture towards pullbacks contrasts with the approach earlier in the year when investors eagerly stepped in to buy equities during periods of weakness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts attribute the shift in large part to the growing expectation that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates fewer times, if at all, in 2024, than was initially expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Netflix fell 0.4 percent ahead of its release of quarterly results. The company reported better-than-expected profits of $2.3 billion after the market closed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The streaming giant is the first major tech company to report this quarter. Other giants, such as Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta, are scheduled to report next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company fell 4.9 percent, citing "weakening macroeconomic conditions" and softening demand. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 3 percent in three-month period ending in March, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That's a 0.1 percentage point increase compared with the December-to-February period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 9,400 people became jobless during the first quarter of 2024, with officials noting that there were 111,700 unemployed persons in the three-month period ending in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rate was generally low despite the uptick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The unemployment rates of most sectors increased in January - March 2024 compared with the preceding three-month period, but stayed low in general," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the economy continues to grow, the labour market will likely remain tight in the near term."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city’s bourse on Thursday announced it is developing a tech platform that would allow it to offer near 24-hour derivatives trading while improving efficiency and introducing new products to address rapidly changing customer needs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), the city’s stock operator, also said that the in-house platform - Orion Derivatives Platform (ODP) - would be launched in 2028, which would help differentiate the group’s derivatives offerings while boosting its global competitiveness in the derivatives market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Building future-ready technology platforms and operations is a key strategic priority for HKEX, as we help our markets and participants deliver long-term, sustainable growth and development,” said the group’s chief executive Bonnie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are therefore pleased to announce plans to develop the ODP, representing our significant investment into the future of our markets,” Chan added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noting that derivatives were one of the faster growing segments of HKEX’s business, with record-breaking volumes in both 2023 and 2022, Chan said such a platform would provide unique advantages - with enhanced trading and clearing capabilities and capital efficient risk management tools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bourse also said it would actively engage with market participants during the development process.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Morgan Stanley and HSBC are cutting dozens of investment banking jobs in the Asia Pacific region this week, sources said, as they ramp up cost-cutting, with weaker dealmaking and sluggish markets weighing on business prospects.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Morgan Stanley is cutting at least 50 investment banking jobs in the region starting this week, three sources with knowledge of the matter said, affecting around 13 percent of the Wall Street bank's Asia investment banking workforce of 400.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Layoffs at the investment banking unit of HSBC, which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, started on Tuesday and are expected to see the departure of around 30 dealmakers in the region this week, three separate sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of the sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the job cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An HSBC spokesperson said the banks is continuing to invest in and grow its business, allocating people and resources to the immediate opportunities, but declined to comment on the job cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, Bank of America laid off around 20 bankers in the region, following a flurry of investment bank downsizing by UBS, Citigroup and other boutique firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside Asia, US banking giants overall continued to shed employees in the first quarter, with Citigroup seeing the biggest drop. Banks are under pressure to control costs due to the uncertain economic outlook. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street stocks gave up more ground on Wednesday. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749358_1_L_20240418044931.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks fell in choppy trading on Wednesday as investors assessed the Federal Reserve's interest rate stance and a batch of soft earnings early in the financial reporting season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Travelers tumbled 7.41 percent and was among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and largest on the Dow Industrials after the insurance giant missed Wall Street expectations for first-quarter profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also weighing on the benchmark S&P index after quarterly results were Prologis, with the warehouse-focused real estate investment trust dropping 7.19 percent, and Abbott Laboratories, which fell 3.03 percent after topping quarterly estimates but disappointing on its annual forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a rally in the last two months of 2023 that extended into the first quarter, equities have struggled with the S&P 500 registering its fourth straight session of declines. The index is on pace for its third straight weekly loss as investors have dialed back expectations for the timing and size of the Fed's rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, US central bank officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell backed away from providing guidance on when rates may be cut, saying instead that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The markets are dealing with a couple things - inflation is hotter than most expect, rate cut expectations are coming down and we've had a ramp higher in geopolitical tensions, particularly out of the Middle East," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's just an excuse for traders to kind of move to the sidelines and markets to kind of take a breath after a really, really strong five months of gains."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.12 percent, to 37,753, the S&P 500 lost 0.58 percent, to 5,022 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.15 percent, to 15,683.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are scheduled to speak later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among gainers, United Airlines surged 17.45 percent after it forecast stronger-than-expected current-quarter numbers. JB Hunt Transport Services slumped 8.12 percent as the worst performer on the S&P 500 after the trucking firm missed Wall Street estimates for first-quarter results. (Reuters)

    EU says Facebook can't charge users for privacy

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Facebook owner Meta and other online platforms must not force users to pay for the right to data protection enshrined in EU law when offering ad-free subscriptions, the European data regulator said Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Online platforms should give users a real choice when employing 'consent or pay' models," the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) chair Anu Talus said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The models we have today usually require individuals to either give away all their data or to pay," he said. "As a result, most users consent to the processing in order to use a service, and they do not understand the full implications of their choices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta in November launched a "pay or consent" system allowing users to withhold use of their data for ad targeting in exchange for a monthly fee – a model that has faced several challenges from privacy and consumer advocates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta has long profited from selling user data to advertisers but this business model has led to multiple battles with EU regulators over data privacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest announcement came after the data protection authorities of The Netherlands, Norway and the German state of Hamburg went to the EDPB for an opinion regarding the pay-or-consent model used by Meta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All digital platforms must comply with the European Union's mammoth general data protection regulation (GDPR), which has been at the root of EU court cases against Meta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EDPB in its opinion argued that Meta's model was at odds with the GDPR's requirement that consent for data use must be freely given.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In most cases, it will not be possible for large online platforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent if they confront users only with a binary choice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes and paying a fee," the opinion read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EDPB also warned the type of subscription service put forward by Meta "should not be the default way forward" for platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It suggested that platforms should consider an alternative that would give users the right to reject being tracked for advertising purposes without the need to pay. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks ended lower in choppy trading on Tuesday as Treasury yields climbed, with investors weighing the likely path of interest rates in a resilient US economy with persistent inflation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday recent inflation data has not given policymakers enough confidence to ease credit soon, noting that the US central bank may need to keep rates higher for longer than previously thought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average got a boost from UnitedHealth Group's better-than-expected quarterly results. Real estate and utilities were the biggest drags on the S&P 500, while technology gave the largest boost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are trying to balance this two-sided narrative: US economic growth, which looks really good, and at the same time the inflation picture and interest rates, which will eventually be problematic for the equity market," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, to 37,799, the S&P 500 lost 0.21 percent, to 5,051 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.12 percent, to 15,865.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are nearly 4 percent off from record high levels reached last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 2.5 percent after its first-quarter profit beat estimates on resurging income from investment banking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bank of America dropped 3.5 percent after the lender posted lower first-quarter profits as its loan loss provisions grew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson & Johnson slipped 2.1 percent as the drugmaker's revenue missed analysts' estimates after sales from its blockbuster psoriasis drug, Stelara, fell short of expectations.

    IMF expects steady growth, lower inflation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The International Monetary Fund says the world economy continues to be resilient. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749203_1_L_20240417023802.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The global economy is set for another year of slow but steady growth, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday, with US strength pushing world output through headwinds from lingering high inflation, weak demand in China and Europe, and spillovers from two regional wars.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The IMF forecast global real GDP growth of 3.2 percent for 2024 and 2025 – the same rate as in 2023. The 2024 forecast was revised upward by 0.1 percentage point from the previous World Economic Outlook's estimate in January, largely due to a significant upward revision in the US outlook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The global economy continues to display remarkable resilience with growth holding steady and inflation declining, but many challenges still lie ahead," Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A potential escalation of the Middle East conflict after Iran's rocket and drone attack on Israel could have a "strong effect" on limiting growth, he said, adding that it would raise oil prices and inflation, triggering tighter monetary policy from central banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US Treasury is preparing to hit Iran with new sanctions in coming days that could limit its ability to export oil, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report described an "adverse scenario" in which a Middle East escalation would lead to a 15 percent increase in oil prices and higher shipping costs would hike global inflation by about 0.7 percentage points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF forecast that global median headline inflation will fall to 2.8 percent by the end of 2024 from 4 percent last year, and to 2.4 percent in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF left unchanged its forecast for China's 2024 growth to fall to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2023. But it warned that the lack of a comprehensive restructuring package for the country's property sector could prolong a downturn in domestic demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gourinchas said, however, that China's stronger-than-expected first-quarter growth may prompt an upward revision to the outlook. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy grew 5.3 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, official data showed on Tuesday, comfortably beating analysts' expectations, a welcome sign for policymakers as they try to shore up demand and confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters news agency had expected first-quarter gross domestic product to expand 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared to 5.2 percent in the previous three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics deputy commissioner, said the nation had made solid progress over the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Generally, in the first quarter, the national economy made a good start, accumulating positive factors and laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual goal," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, we should say that there are rising complexities and uncertainties in the external environment," he said, adding that authorities will boost economic vitality, prevent and diffuse risks, as well as enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland officials are aiming for economic growth of around five percent for 2024, a target that many analysts believe is ambitious and may require more stimulus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, retail sales and industrial production in China slowed in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1 percent year-on-year in March, down from a 5.5 percent increase in the first two months of 2024, while industrial production rose 4.5 percent, down from a 7 percent increase in the first two months, official data showed. (Reuters/AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tensions in the Middle East weighed heavily on investor sentiment. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749050_1_L_20240416043054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished decisively lower on Monday despite solid US economic data, in a decline blamed on worries over conflict in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities had opened positively following solid retail sales data, amid early hopes that the conflict between Israel and Iran might ebb after a weekend siege by Iran was mostly repelled by air defences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israeli officials kept up the confrontational rhetoric, with Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi vowing a response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 37,735, down 0.7 percent after notching a 650-point fall from its peak earlier in the session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 1.2 percent to 5,061, while the Nasdaq fell 1.8 percent to 15,885.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare pointed to the geopolitical situation as a factor in Monday's drop, but also noted that the retreat follows a period of market strength.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you set aside what's happening geopolitically there have been calls for a while now that the market's due for a pullback," O'Hare said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So there's an overdue period of consolidation kicking in here, which has been helped along by the geopolitical uncertainty, rising interest rates, and again, the technical deterioration in the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Goldman Sachs rose 2.9 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits on a strong performance across most businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla slumped 5.6 percent after Elon Musk's electric vehicle company announced it was cutting more than 10 percent of its global headcount amid rising competition for EVs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salesforce plunged 7.3 percent following reports it is in talks to buy technology company Informatica. Informatica lost 6.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company associated with the ex-president and current US Republican White House nominee, dove 18.4 percent after announcing plans to issue more shares. (AFP)

    Firms win approval to launch spot bitcoin, ether ETFs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At least three asset managers say they have given the green light to launch the virtual asset spot ETFs. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749005_1_L_20240415191521.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Monday gave initial approval to its first spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), paving the way for the city to become Asia’s first to treat cryptocurrencies as a mainstream investment tool, according to fund managers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least three offshore Chinese asset managers will launch the virtual asset spot ETFs soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The local units of Harvest Fund Management and Bosera Asset Management said they had received conditional approvals from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the city’s securities watchdog, to launch the ETFs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the local unit of China Asset Management said it had received regulatory approval for the provision of virtual asset management services, and that it's actively deploying the spot bitcoin and ether ETFs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emil Chan, co-chair of the Hong Kong Digital Finance Association, told RTHK that the move will boost the SAR's status as a financial centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There was an exodus earlier that many funds and talent moved from Hong Kong to Singapore because they were unclear about the regulatory status... this time, Hong Kong has moved fast to catch up in a short period of time,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fintech specialist also noted that traditional investors may be attracted to this market as the crypto ETFs allow them to utilise the traditional trading mechanism to access such assets without needing to worry about managing cryptocurrency keys and storage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US launched its first ETFs to track spot bitcoin in January, drawing roughly US$12 billion in net flows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s bourse may take about two weeks to prepare the funds to be offered, meaning the first set of spot ETFs could be available as early as this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The [approval] of the crypto ETFs sent a strong signal to the traditional securities trading markets and players that they have to move forward to look into crypto trading with a different perspective," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the past they considered crypto as unreal, but now it’s being sorted, and if its progress is solid, then it will boost transition and development of the virtual asset industry.” (Additional reporting by Reuters)

  According to the latest data released by Airports Council International, Chek Lap Kok handled 4.3 million tonnes of cargo last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the 13th time since 2010 that the airport has been named the busiest cargo airport in the world.

  "Air cargo is a key driver of the growth of Hong Kong’s logistics industry and overall economic development," Airport Authority chairman Jack So said, adding that the authority will work with the air cargo community to further strengthen the airport's competitiveness.

 Mainland tea shop chain Sichuan Baicha Baidao Industrial aims to raise HK$2.5 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), in the city's largest new-share sale of 2024, regulatory filings showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company is selling 147.7 million shares at HK$17.50 each, which represents about 10 percent of its total shares, the filings showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An extra 22.1 million shares could be sold through a so-called greenshoe option. That would see the total number of shares increase to 169.9 million, to raise almost HK$3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shares will start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on April 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Baicha Baidao operates ChaPanda stores which sell a range of fruit tea drinks primarily to younger customers, the company said in its IPO prospectus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong IPO volume is at its lowest level in more than a decade with new-share sales raising US$507 million in the first quarter of this year, down nearly 29 percent from US$710 million from the same time last year, LSEG data showed. (Reuters)

    'Iran strikes to boost oil, but maybe not for long'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Iran was the world's seventh-largest crude producer in 2022. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748862_1_L_20240414232003.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's attack on Israel has injected fresh anxiety into oil markets already roiled by regional tensions, but analysts stress that it is unclear if a durable price spike is imminent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Saturday's overnight drone and missile barrage was Iran's first-ever direct assault on Israeli territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tehran says it was triggered by the April 1 air strike on its consulate building in the Syrian capital that was widely blamed on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Iranian mission to the United Nations warned on X of "considerably more severe" actions should Israel "make another mistake," raising the prospect of intensifying violence in the days ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices had already jumped in the build-up to the Iranian attack, with benchmark Brent North Sea Crude closing on Friday at US$90.45 per barrel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices are expected to climb further when markets reopen on Monday, perhaps as high as US$95 per barrel, though it is too soon to say whether they will stay elevated, said Kuwaiti oil expert Kamel al-Harami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The picture is not clear about the future. We do not know if and how Israel will respond and whether Iran will also resort to stopping oil supplies as a response," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic republic was the world's seventh-largest crude producer in 2022, and has the third-largest proven oil reserves behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran also has a range of ways to wreak havoc with markets, including disrupting maritime traffic through the Strait of Hormuz and pressuring countries such as Iraq to cut supply, Harami said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are several scenarios... The fear is that Iran will stop exporting oil or attack oil facilities," Harami said. (AFP)
