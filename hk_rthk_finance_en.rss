<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said a government-owned investment vehicle will sign a cooperation deal on Wednesday with a local "tech unicorn" – a start-up company worth more than US$1 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan did not name the company concerned, but said it operated in the artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the tie-up with Hong Kong Investment Corporation will help the business expand research and development investment here, as well as fund training of staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said the deal would help the company roll out the use of its AI models in the Greater Bay Area and speed up digital transformation in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the purpose of the corporation is to help promote innovation and technology in Hong Kong by attracting enterprises and professionals with high potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the number of tech start-ups in the city exceeded 4,250 last year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="For the week, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 percent, the Nasdaq rose 2.38 percent, and the Dow added 0.29 percent. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756581_1_20240608045238.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks ended slightly lower on Friday in choppy trading after stronger-than-expected US jobs data pointed to a robust economy but prompted worries the Federal Reserve may wait longer to cut interest rates than many investors had hoped.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy generated about 272,000 jobs in May, far more than the 185,000 analysts had forecast, according to a Labour Department report. The unemployment rate inched up to 4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The benchmark S&P 500 slipped immediately after the report while US Treasury yields climbed as traders slashed bets on a September rate reduction. The index recovered and briefly hit a fresh intraday record high as investors noted the data pointed to underlying economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It finished slightly lower, with the utilities, materials, and communication services stocks among the biggest drag. Financials and technology advanced ahead of others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the week, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 percent, the Nasdaq rose 2.38 percent, and the Dow added 0.29 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This tells you there's certainly not going to a cut in the short term, and with the bond yields going back up it's putting a lot of pressure on the risk-on trade, which is probably small caps," said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's just a function of interest rates and maybe a little higher for longer, and people have to recalibrate for that type of environment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a 56 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Investors will eye US inflation data next week and the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which ends on June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one expects the Fed to cut (rates next week), but will they open the door for a cut as soon as September is the big question on everyone's mind," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, adding he still sees a September reduction on the table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.22 percent, to 38,798, the S&P 500 lost 0.11 percent, to 5,346 and the Nasdaq lost 0.23 percent, to 17,133.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop slumped 39 percent in volatile trading just as stock influencer "Roaring Kitty" kicked off his first livestream in three years. The gaming retailer had announced a potential stock offering and a drop in quarterly sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other so-called meme stocks, including AMC Entertainment and Koss Corp, fell 15.1 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia slipped, on track to extend the previous session's losses, with its valuation again dipping below the US$3 trillion mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lyft shares rose 0.6 percent, following a forecast of 15 percent annual growth in its gross bookings through 2027 after markets closed on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 1,177 stocks rose and 3,064 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.6-to-1 ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 149 new lows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total volume of shares traded across US exchanges was about 10.75 billion, compared with the 12.7 billion average over the last 20 trading days. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden says the jobs report is a sign of the economy’s robust health. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756572_1_20240608011135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 America’s employers added a strong 272,000 jobs in May, accelerating from April and a sign that companies are still confident enough in the economy to keep hiring despite persistently high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last month’s sizeable job gain suggests that the economy is still growing steadily, propelled by consumer spending on travel, entertainment and other services. US airports, for example, reported near-record traffic over the Memorial Day weekend. A healthy job market typically drives consumer spending, the economy’s principal fuel. Though some recent signs had raised concerns about economic weakness, May’s jobs report should help assuage those fears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, Friday's report from the government included some signs of a potential slowdown. The unemployment rate, for example, edged up for a second straight month, to a still-low 4 percent, from 3.9 percent, ending a 27-month streak of unemployment below 4 percent. That streak had matched the longest such run since the late 1960s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden pointed to Friday's jobs report as a sign of the economy’s robust health under his administration. He also charged that congressional Republicans would worsen inflation by cutting health care subsidies and widening the deficit through tax cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has focused his criticism of Biden’s economic policies on the surge in inflation , which polls show still weighs heavily in voters’ assessment of the economy. At a rally in Phoenix on Thursday, he blamed illegal immigration for contributing to higher prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists say the mixed signals from Friday's report – a surge in jobs alongside a slight rise in unemployment – are likely a sign that the job market is normalising after years of distortions related to the pandemic. After the brutal pandemic recession, when unemployment rocketed to nearly 15 percent, hiring soared in 2022 and 2023 as the economy quickly recovered. Wages, before adjusting for inflation, also jumped as businesses desperately sought to fill jobs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of open jobs, while still elevated, has fallen to a three-year low, the government said this week. Fewer workers are quitting their jobs, after quits had soared after the pandemic. Many employers say it's become easier to find workers to fill their open jobs. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports grew more quickly and for a second month in May, suggesting factory owners are managing to find buyers overseas and providing some relief to the economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 7.6 percent year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Friday, beating a forecast 6 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 1.5 percent rise seen in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports increased 1.8 percent in May, slowing from an 8.4 percent jump in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over recent months, a flurry of data has shown different parts of the US$18.6 trillion economy recovering at varying speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While first quarter growth blew past forecasts and strong March export and output data suggested improving global demand might aid officials' efforts to get the economy back on a more even keel, recent indicators have reflected domestic consumption had softened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A protracted property sector crisis remains the biggest drag on China's economy, with low investor and consumer confidence hurting domestic consumption and undermining business activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Friday's trade data should give authorities some breathing space as they continue their efforts to foster a broad-based economic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund last month upgraded its China growth forecast for 2024 in line with Beijing's growth target of "around" five percent, but warned of risks to the economy from the property troubles. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were little changed on Thursday after hitting records a day earlier, as traders awaited data on the labour market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones inched up 0.2 percent to 38,886, while the S&P 500 ended flat at 5,352.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 17,173.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached new highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not uncommon. It seems like every time the market makes a new high, there is not a lot of follow through," said Karl Haeling of LBBW.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market movements also came after the European Central Bank lowered interest rates for the first time since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haeling noted that although the ECB cut was anticipated, its tone was "less dovish than expected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All attention is now on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, as traders look for signs that the US central bank may soon follow suit in reducing interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, traders are looking ahead to the latest US employment report due out on Friday indicating the health of the labour market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While hiring has proven more resilient than anticipated in the face of high interest rates, cooling job growth could prompt the Fed to lower rates sooner rather than later.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The jump in imports was largely due to an increase in goods such as automotive vehicles, says the US Commerce Department. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756429_1_20240607034054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US trade deficit expanded slightly less than analysts expected in April, to the widest since late 2022, as imports rose more quickly than exports, according to government data released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overall gap was US$74.6 billion, growing from March's revised US$68.6 billion figure, said the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the largest deficit since October 2022, according to official data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US consumption has been more resilient than anticipated even as the central bank rapidly hiked interest rates to dampen demand – and this has helped to support imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with weaker global demand, there have been concerns that export growth would not be able to keep up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors are also watching the Federal Reserve for the outcome of its policy meeting next week, looking for hints on when it might start cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The early data are pointing to a drag from trade in the second quarter," said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, imports grew by 2.4 percent to US$338.2 billion, while exports rose by 0.8 percent to US$263.7 billion, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jump in imports was largely due to an increase in goods such as automotive vehicles, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goods exports, meanwhile, also picked up but by a smaller degree, with a rise seen in products like pharmaceutical preparations and electric apparatus, data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Imports have been supported by strong domestic demand and lean inventories," said Matthew Martin, US economist at Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exports have contended with a weaker global backdrop and a strong US dollar which makes domestic goods relatively more expensive abroad," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The goods deficit with China dropped by US$2.5 billion to US$22.1 billion in April. This was mainly due to a decrease in imports. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index pushed to new highs on Wednesday. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756277_1_20240606034443.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs on Wednesday, powered mainly by technology stocks as markets digested economic data that could support a much-expected start to the Federal Reserve's policy easing cycle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to end at 5,354, the Nasdaq Composite gained just under two percent to 17,187. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 percent to 38,807.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The May private payrolls report on Wednesday became the latest data to suggest an easing in labour market tightness that could propel the Fed to begin cutting rates this year. A report on Tuesday showed job openings fell in April to the fewest in more than three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're seeing the economic data starting to ease up a little bit and the repercussions for that is that you're seeing the pressure on rates come off the boil a little bit mixed in with the potential for weaker economic data, which is a pretty good recipe for the bond market," said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders now see a nearly 69 percent chance of a September rate reduction, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. Expectations had hovered around 50 percent last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US 10-year Treasury yields fell to a two-month low on Wednesday after a report pointed to weaker-than-expected job growth ahead of Friday's highly anticipated government employment report for May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip stocks leapt, buoyed by gains to Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which both touched record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hewlett Packard Enterprise rose after forecasting third-quarter revenue above Street expectations, helped by upbeat demand for its AI servers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel gained after buyout firm Apollo Global Management agreed to purchase 49 percent for US$11 billion in a joint venture related to the chipmaker's Ireland manufacturing unit. (Reuters)

    Lawsuit says Google parent abused its position

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Google has urged Britain's competition watchdog to block a lawsuit that accuses the tech giant of abusing its position. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756264_1_20240605234046.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google parent Alphabet must face a lawsuit worth up to 13.6 billion pounds for allegedly abusing its dominance in the online advertising market, London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit, which seeks damages on behalf of publishers of websites and apps based in the United Kingdom, is the latest case to focus on the search giant's business practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action is bringing the claim on behalf of publishers who say they have suffered losses due to Google's allegedly anti-competitive behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google last month urged the CAT to block the case, which it argued was incoherent. The company "strongly rejects the underlying allegations", its lawyers said in court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CAT said in a written ruling that it would certify the case to proceed towards a trial, which is unlikely to take place before the end of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tribunal also emphasised the test for certifying a case under the UK's collective proceedings regime – which is roughly equivalent to the United States' class action regime – is relatively low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Google works constructively with publishers across the UK and Europe," Google legal director Oliver Bethell said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bethell added: "This lawsuit is speculative and opportunistic. We'll oppose it vigorously and on the facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Claudio Pollack, a partner of Ad Tech Collection Action, said: "This is a decision of major importance to the victims of Google's anti-competitive conduct in ad tech. Google will now have to answer for its practices in a full trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ad Tech Collective Action's case comes amid ongoing probes by regulators into Google's adtech business, including by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority and the European Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google is also fighting two lawsuits in the United States, one brought by the Department of Justice and another by Texas and other states, accusing the company of anti-competitive conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Google's lawyers said in documents for the CAT case that the company's "impact in the ad tech industry has been hugely pro-competitive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wednesday's decision is the latest against a tech giant to be given the green light by the CAT, which already this year has certified a US$3.8 billion case against Facebook parent Meta and a nearly US$1 billion case against Apple. (Reuters)

    'Wealth connect scheme could be widened further'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, says they are looking into further upgrading the cross-border Wealth Connect Scheme. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756167_1_20240605125906.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief executive Eddie Yue on Wednesday said authorities are looking into the feasibility of further widening a wealth connect scheme to attract large sums of capital from the Greater Bay Area to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a wealth summit, Yue noted that the city’s de facto central bank upgraded the “Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme” to a 2.0 version in February, to cover a greater variety of investment products and enabling more mainland investors to trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue said the authorities are now studying whether the scheme can be upgraded to a 3.0 version, so the city can better cater to private banking customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s still in the early days, [but] we are talking to the industry very closely about what's needed. Is it the quota? Or is it the scope of products? Or is it the selling process?” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, the quota. Currently, the individual quota is up to three million renminbi, but that's actually not quite enough for private bank clients. Is there a way to have a separate channel to capture the private bank clients?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The selling process has been a lot easier and smoother than before. But can it be further streamlined? Or can the marketing be made more active? Can the education be done better? I think there are still areas that we can look into in terms of improvements,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue added that a significant increase in capital inflows from the north to the SAR was observed following the previous upgrade, and indicated that a further expansion could potentially attract more middle-class investors in the development zone who have the greatest need to diversify their assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme, launched in September 2021, was Beijing’s first tailor-made plan to boost sales and capital flows between Hong Kong, Macau and the nine other cities in the Greater Bay Area.

    Wall Street up as jobs data boosts rates hope

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended a shade higher on Tuesday following softer-than-expected labor market data that reaffirmed expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Tuesday showed that US job openings fell to their lowest level in more than three years in April, signaling an easing in labour market tightness that supported a Fed rate cut this year. The US Treasury yields slipped following the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street's main indexes gained ground after paring earlier loses. Equities in real estate and consumer staples sectors advanced ahead of others, while materials and energy stocks were the biggest losers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The labour market data was the latest in a string of recent reports that pointed to cooling US economic growth. Data on Monday showed that US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we've seen in the data so far this week is that it's been relatively weak, starting with manufacturing PMI and job openings today," said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in Santa Monica, California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That has had a total effect of helping the rally in the bond market; but for the stock market, it's a double-edged sword because they're looking for a rate cut announcement, which has a rising probability with weaker data," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.36 percent, to 38,711, the S&P 500 gained 0.15 percent, to 5,291 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.17 percent, to 16,857.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacap technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, ended higher after losing ground early in the session. Oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron fell 1.6 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, as demand concerns weighed on crude prices.
  <br/>

  Bath & Body Works slumped 12.8 percent after a lower revision to its quarterly profit forecast. Axos Financial dropped after Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in the lender. (Reuters)

    AI biotech firm in first listing under Chapter 18C

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wen Shuhao, chairman of QuantumPharm (centre), says the introduction of the Chapter 18C rule shows the SAR's capital markets value the technology sector. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756023_1_20240604124200.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland artificial intelligence drug research firm QuantumPharm on Tuesday said it plans to raise up to HK$1.13 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), as it becomes the first company to take advantage of a new rule designed to entice technology firms to list in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Tencent-backed firm, also known as XtalPi, is offering 187.37 million shares, 95 percent of which will be issued internationally and five percent of which will be issued in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price range of the shares will be between HK$5.03 and HK$6.03, with an “entry fee” of HK$6,091. Trading will begin on June 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The listing is under the Chapter 18C rule introduced by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in March last year, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies with a valuation of at least HK$10 billion are allowed to sell shares in IPOs even if they are yet to generate revenue. For firms that have generated revenue, the valuation threshold is reduced to HK$6 billion if they had at least HK$250 million in sales in the financial year prior to their IPO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, the firm’s chairman, Wen Shuhao, said the introduction of Chapter 18C shows the city’s capital markets value the technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company plans to bring in eight cornerstone investors with a combined contribution of nearly HK$338 million to subscribe for the shares, including Peter Lee, the chairman of Henderson Land Development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ronald Tam, QuantumPharm's chief financial officer, said he believes the Shenzhen-headquartered firm will be able to generate profits in the near term, despite seeing losses over the past three financial years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chapter 18C rule applies to applicants in high-tech, advanced hardware and software, new materials, new energy, as well as food and agriculture technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only other firm which has applied to list under the rule so far is Black Sesame International Holding, which produces chips for autonomous driving.

 S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged higher in a choppy session on Monday amid soft manufacturing sector data and as a glitch on the NYSE briefly caused trading halts in dozens of equities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange had triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold. Trading in at least 60 NYSE-listed stocks was halted due to the volatility, before the bourse fixed the technical issue and activity resumed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished higher after paring earlier losses on the sesson, while the Dow lost ground. Technology stocks were the biggest gainers, while energy equities were the biggest drag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets had weighed data showing US manufacturing activity had slowed for the second straight month, raising concerns of weakening economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of those days where people are waiting for the next catalyst with a choppy move after earnings," said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's bit of a tug of war between the market seeing weakening data and the expectation that the Fed may cut rates," Lerner added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.30 percent, to 38,571, the S&P 500 gained 0.11 percent, to 5,283 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.56 percent, to 16,829.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia rose 4.9 percent after CEO Jensen Huang revealed that the company's next-generation AI chip platform would be rolled out in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of other megacaps, including Apple, Amazon , Alphabet, and Meta closed higher. Microsoft and Tesla finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop soared 21 percent after a weekend Reddit post from stocks influencer Keith Gill, also known as "Roaring Kitty", showed a US$116 million bet on the gaming retailer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will be eyeing a data-packed week that includes surveys on the services sector, factory orders and Friday's closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, which could provide clues to the Fed's likely course of action with regards to rates. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A glitch at the New York Stock Exchange triggered massive swings in the shares of Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold, and trading halts in dozens of other companies on Monday, before the bourse fixed the problem.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange, by late morning said on its website it had resolved a reported technical issue and that the impacted stocks had resumed trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 60 stocks listed on the NYSE were halted due to volatility and some stocks showed unusual outsized movements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold shares were shown to be down 99.97 percent and 98.54 percent, respectively, due to the technical issue, before those trades were corrected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NYSE said the problem was related to Limit Up-Limit Down bands meant to prevent extraordinary market volatility and extreme price movements in individual stock by preventing trades outside of specific price ranges that are updated throughout the trading day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The price band for each security is set at a percentage level above and below its average price in the preceding five-minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bands were developed as part of the response by financial regulators and exchanges to the "flash crash" of 2010, which wiped out nearly US$1 trillion in market capitalisation in a few minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Technical issues on exchanges can hit markets, impact traders' confidence and attract scrutiny from regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think the overall market is reacting," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong's economy would continue to grow despite the challenges brought by geopolitical tensions and changes in consumption patterns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting on financial affairs, Chan said growth in employment income and a recovery in the stock market should help increase private spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho asked what would be done to help the struggling retail sector after sales dropped in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister said the government was in talks with central authorities for measures to boost the local economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are indeed looking into increasing the duty-free allowances for visitors returning to the mainland right now. The HK$5,000 figure has been in place for quite some time. We have been liaising with the central authorities on this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have recently included eight other cities in the individual visit scheme, and we will seek to expand the scheme even further. While we do understand that we should have more such policy support in place, we should be prudent in the effects or potential impact of these measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election committee lawmaker Tan Yueheng was concerned over whether there would be measures to reverse the trend of Hongkongers heading north to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may be hard to compete in terms of prices, but we can enhance the quality of services in Hong Kong. So how can we promote two-way consumption to enhance the contribution of consumption to GDP in Hong Kong?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Chan said the city should look for ways to improve product and tourist experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have our unique attractions. We never compete with others in terms of price. We compete with others in terms of the quality of services. We compete with others in terms of the quality of our goods and services and the experience we offer," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think various sectors, be it retail or catering, we all need to transform and enhance our competitiveness and increase the cost to value of their products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief noted that property prices have stabilised after the scrapping of all "spicy" property cooling measures, adding the SAR would think of ways to avoid getting caught up in the cross-hairs of Sino-US tensions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Sunday said it is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic passenger flights by the first quarter of 2025, having reached 80 percent of capacity within the second quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's flagship airline, which suffered heavy losses and layoffs during the pandemic, had aimed to reach 100 percent capacity by the end of 2024, but in March moved the target back three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay reported its first annual profit in four years in March, however executives said they expect yields to normalise this year as the post-pandemic global imbalance between supply of flights and travel demand that drove up ticket prices and airline yields diminishes as airlines add capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed we're seeing that this year ... the yield has been normalising gradually coming down from last year. In particular, the supply and demand balancing is going quicker on the regional, the short haul routes,"  Cathay CEO Ronald Lam told reporters during an airline conference in Dubai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier also restored capacity more slowly after the pandemic than its closest rival, Singapore Airlines, because it faced tighter quarantine rules for longer, and needed to hire more staff to bring back services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said Cathay's plan to expand its workforce by around 20 percent, or 5,000 people, this year was also on track. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day mainly higher on Friday, with the Dow and S&P both rising after April data for the Fed's favoured inflation measure broadly matched expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The moves came after Commerce Department data showed that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in April, largely unchanged from March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 1.5 percent at 38,686, while the S&P 500 ended the day 0.8 percent higher at 5,277.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq was the only major New York index that did not rise on Friday, closing almost unchanged at 16,735.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're on track for a positive month," Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones said before the closing bell, adding that there was often "a bit of rebalancing" at the end of the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe on Monday that could easily be reversed," he added.

    <![CDATA[<img alt='New York Fed president John Williams says he expects inflation will "resume moderating in the second half of this year." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755624_1_20240531232750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation remained unchanged in April, according to government data published on Friday, as services prices remained elevated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news will likely lead the US central bank to keep interest rates elevated throughout the summer, as it balances a desire to start easing monetary policy with the need to keep inflation falling towards its long-term two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said in a statement, while monthly inflation increased by 0.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These figures were in line with the median forecast in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, and came in at the same level as it did in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After falling for much of last year, inflation accelerated again at the start of 2024, reducing the likelihood of early rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High rates also complicate US President Joe Biden's reelection message as he seeks to convince still-sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, services sector inflation drove much of the increase, rising at an annual rate of 3.9 percent – slightly lower than a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stripping out volatile food and energy prices – both of which continued to rise last month – the closely watched "core" measure of inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in April, in line with expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This suggests that underlying inflation remains elevated, a fact which could keep the Fed on pause for longer than previously anticipated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, New York Fed president John Williams, who is a permanent voting member of the US central bank's rate-setting committee, said he expected inflation would "resume moderating in the second half of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at all the data, I don't feel any urgency or need to make a decision now," he told an event in New York, adding that things were going in the "right direction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data published on Friday also show that personal income eased to 0.3 percent last month, the Commerce Department said, down slightly from 0.5 percent in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Personal savings as a percentage of disposable income came in at 3.6 percent in last month, in line with the revised figure from March. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Provisional data from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the city's retail sales for April fell 14.7 percent from a year earlier, partly due to a drop in visitor spending and a large number of outbound trips during the Easter holidays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales decreased to HK$29.6 billion in the second consecutive month of decline after a seven percent drop in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first four months of 2024 taken together, it was provisionally estimated the value of total retail sales decreased by 4.7 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in April 2024 saw it decrease by 16.5 percent compared with a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined notably in April from a year earlier, partly because the Easter holidays rendered the effects of the changing consumption pattern of residents more visible," a government spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large number of residents made outbound trips during the Easter holidays. This not only affected their local consumption during their time away but also could have reduced consumption in the days before and after the trips."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that unstable weather in April also had an impact on spending. Looking ahead, he said the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents would continue to pose a challenge to the local retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the government hoped the revival of inbound tourism and rising earnings, as well as the new round of mega events plus the recent stabilisation of asset markets such as property would provide support to the market and boost the economy.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell for a second straight session on Thursday following a downgrade in a US growth report as several large tech shares tumbled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the January to March period, the Commerce Department said, below the 1.6 percent figure published last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Dow member Salesforce plunged nearly 20 percent as the technology company published mixed results and lowered some of its full-year projections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other large tech companies followed Salesforce lower. Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon all fell 1.5 percent or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 38,111.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent to 5,235, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.1 percent to 16,737.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses came on the heels of Wednesday's session in which major indices retreated amid worries that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high due to persistent inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about interest rates. We don't see any relief in sight from the Fed," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "There is a growing view that they won't cut at all this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Best Buy soared 13.4 percent despite reporting a 6.1 percent drop in comparable sales as investors were encouraged by commentary suggesting an improvement in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Kohl's plunged 22.9 percent after results missed expectations. The retailer reported a loss of US$27 million. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three main indexes were lower in New York at midday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755452_1_20240531004342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets diverged on Thursday, a day ahead of key inflation indicators that could determine the future direction of interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All the main indexes were lower in New York at midday, following on to Wednesday's slump when shares were hit by concerns that interest rates will not be coming down any time soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US shares were also hit by Salesforce slumping 21 percent after the software company reported disappointing results the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Treasury yields fell back after figures pointed to a slightly weakening US economy, though they were just off their recent highs, indicating expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's second update to first quarter GDP data showed it grew an annually adjusted 1.3 percent, slower than the initial estimate of 1.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders awaited Friday's release of the crucial personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, hoping for signs that prices are being brought under control enough for rates to be cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though Treasury yields eased this morning from yesterday's four-week highs, the market appears anxious heading into PCE," said Joe Mazzola, a strategist at Charles Schwab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rising yields snuffed out the tech-led stock market rally yesterday even before Salesforce missed quarterly revenue expectations and sank double-digits," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday also sees the release of the latest eurozone consumer price index, a key release ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting on June 6 and which could decide whether the central bank goes ahead and as expected cuts rates by 25 basis points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe's main stock markets closed higher on Thursday, making up some of the losses from the previous session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Thursday, the Sydney stock market closed lower with shares in BHP shedding 1.7 percent after the Australian mining giant ended its US$49-billion takeover bid for British rival Anglo American, whose shares were down five percent in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices fell ahead of this weekend's Opec meeting over concerns about future demand in China and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Oil is on track for its second straight day of falling prices amid softer US growth data ahead of Sunday's Opec+ meeting," said Axel Rudolph, Senior Market Analyst at IG. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Wednesday as rising Treasury bond yields prompted a wave of selling after recent records.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Now that the (first-quarter earnings) period is essentially over, inflation and interest rates are front of mind," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, noting that the Dow has pulled back after topping 40,000 earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 percent on the day to 38,441.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.7 percent to 5,266, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.6 percent to 16,920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have attributed the rise in Treasury yields partly to commentary from US Federal Reserve officials warning that elevated inflation could keep interest rates high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market observers have also cited disappointing demand for US Treasury bonds as a factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Fed's latest "beige book" of economic conditions pointed to a somewhat gloomier outlook, although economic activity remained positive from early April to mid-May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Marathon Oil shot up 8.4 percent after it agreed to be acquired by ConocoPhillips in an all-stock transaction valued at US$22.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ConocoPhillips declined 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Airlines sank 13.5 percent after it lowered its profit outlook, citing weaker demand and a troubled booking system upgrade. (AFP)

    BHP abandons bid for Anglo American

    <![CDATA[<img alt="BHP has scrapped a huge takeover offer just before a key deadline. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755279_1_20240530014949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's BHP announced on Wednesday that it has walked away from a proposed US$49-billion takeover of British rival Anglo American that would have created a copper titan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  BHP said in a statement that it will not make a firm offer for Anglo American, ending a six-week saga and scrapping its gigantic proposal just before a key Wednesday deadline which its UK rival had refused to extend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A core part of BHP's plan was splitting off Anglo's platinum holdings in South Africa, a politically sensitive move that stirred government opposition ahead of the country's general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP's offer had also proposed Anglo American hiving off its iron ore production activities in South Africa under plans to focus on copper, demand for which is booming over its use in green technologies and artificial intelligence (AI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP will not be making a firm offer for Anglo American," BHP chief executive Mike Henry said in a statement bringing an end to their efforts, which had seen the Australian company twice raise its initial proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we believed that our proposal for Anglo American was a compelling opportunity to effectively grow the pie of value for both sets of shareholders, we were unable to reach agreement with Anglo American on our specific views in respect of South African regulatory risk and cost."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP remained confident however that its plan "was the most effective structure to deliver value for Anglo American shareholders" and could have "obtained all required regulatory approvals, including in South Africa", he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-listed giant had rejected a third offer from BHP last week, worth 38.6 billion pounds, but agreed to keep talks alive for seven more days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to BHP's overtures, Anglo had recently announced it would offload its coal, diamond and platinum businesses to focus on critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Wednesday, Anglo American had rejected BHP's request to extend talks over its vast proposal beyond a 1600 GMT deadline for it to either make a concrete offer or abandon the bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said its board had unanimously concluded that there was "no basis for a further extension" for BHP to explore its proposal, adding that there were "fundamental concerns" over the bid structure and value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The offer "includes the same highly complex and unattractive structure", Anglo American argued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the deadline, BHP -- which is listed in London and Sydney -- had made a last-ditch attempt to mollify concerns and keep its bid alive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP believes that its proposal will contribute to South Africa and allow the benefits of South African mining to be shared with more South African stakeholders," the company had insisted in its previous statement as it requested a further deadline extension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any deal between two of the world's largest resources companies would have fundamentally reshaped the sector, with far-reaching consequences for commodities markets and the global energy transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP's interest was largely stoked by its hunger to secure a reliable copper supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anglo American's South American copper holdings include four of the largest copper mines in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An electrical conductor used in wiring, the metal is seen as a bedrock of emerging clean-energy industries -- a crucial component to manufacture solar panels, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also widely regarded as vital for the development of cutting-edge AI technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copper prices have increased about 400 percent in the past quarter of a century, and broke US$10,000 a tonne in April for the first time in two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boom has already prompted a wave of investment, with BHP snapping up Australian copper producer OZ Minerals for more than US$6 billion last year. (AFP)

 The European Union on Wednesday announced the creation of an "AI Office" of tech experts, lawyers and economists to regulate artificial intelligence under a sweeping new law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU this year approved the world's first comprehensive rules to govern AI, especially powerful systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT after long, intense negotiations.

  First proposed in 2021, the bloc raced to get the law in the books after ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, leaving users stunned by its ability to churn out coherent text including poems within seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The AI Office aims at enabling the future development, deployment and use of AI in a way that fosters societal and economic benefits and innovation, while mitigating risks," the European Commission said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 140-member AI Office will be established within the commission, which is the EU's executive arm and also acts as the bloc's powerful tech regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Office will foster a European AI ecosystem that is innovative, competitive and respectful of EU rules and values," the EU's top tech enforcer, Thierry Breton, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's law known as the "AI Act" has tougher rules for general-purpose AI systems such as ChatGPT and takes a risk-based approach to the technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The higher the risk to Europeans' rights or health, for example, the greater the systems' obligations to protect individuals from harms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with developers and a scientific community, the office will evaluate and test general purpose AI to ensure that AI serves us as humans and upholds our European values," commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies will have to comply with the EU's law by 2026, but rules covering AI models like ChatGPT will apply 12 months after the law becomes official.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's announcement came on the same day that EU auditors criticised the commission for failing to sufficiently invest in AI to achieve the bloc's ambitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, stronger governance and more -- and better targeted -- public and private investment in the EU will be paramount if the EU is to achieve its AI ambitions," the bloc's spending watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the commission defended the bloc's record and said it was investing more than one billion euros (US$1.1 billion) annually in AI research projects under different schemes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US energy giant ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday it will acquire competitor Marathon Oil in an all-stock transaction valued at US$22.5 billion, including US$5.4 billion in debt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deal, the latest in a series of major acquisitions in the US oil sector, will enable ConocoPhillips to strengthen its position in shale oil and gas-rich regions such as the Bakken Basin in the northern United States and the Permian Basin in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acquisition "further deepens our portfolio and fits within our financial framework, adding high-quality, low cost of supply inventory adjacent to our leading US unconventional position," ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive officer Ryan Lance said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the company sees "significant synergy potential" in the merger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marathon Oil chief Lee Tillman said it was a "proud moment to look back on what we achieved," and that ConocoPhillips was "the right home to build on that legacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, gives Marathon Oil shareholders 0.255 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each share of Marathon Oil common stock. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s lived-in home prices rose for the second straight month in April, increasing by 0.3 percent from March, with all home sizes seeing gains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Wednesday showed that the latest official price index of second-hand units stood at 308.7 last month, compared with 305.7 in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase was broad-based, as all small, medium, and large sized units saw gains of about 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came after the index logged its first increase in 11 months in March, as buyers returned to the market after Financial Secretary Paul Chan scrapped all property cooling measures in his Budget on February 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, taking the first four months in total, home prices still fell 0.84 percent, and the latest index level was still about 13 percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rental prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent on a monthly basis, also a second straight increase, but still 4.6 percent lower from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s rents rose 0.5 percent in the first four months of the year.

    IMF lifts China's 2024 growth forecast to 5pc

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday raised its 2024 growth forecast for China to five percent, citing recent policy moves by Beijing to boost the nation's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's economic growth is projected to remain resilient at five percent in 2024 and slow to 4.5 percent in 2025," the IMF said in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was "driven by strong first-quarter GDP data and recent policy measures", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fund had initially projected 4.6 percent growth for this year – compared with "around five percent" targeted by authorities in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF also welcomed official steps in recent weeks to boost the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, it added that "a more comprehensive policy package would facilitate an efficient and less costly transition while safeguarding against downside risks". (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Nasdaq was the star performer on Wall Street, breaking through 17,000 for the first time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq crossed 17,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday, boosted by gains in Nvidia, while the S&P 500 closed slightly higher and the Dow slightly lower as Treasury yields rose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nvidia shares boosted shares of other chip stocks as traders returned from a holiday-extended weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks lost ground in the afternoon as US Treasury yields climbed to multi-week highs after weak debt auctions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.03 percent to 5,306, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 percent to 17,019. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 percent to 38,852.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors awaited US inflation data this week that could sway expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index report for April is due later this week. The Fed's preferred inflation barometer is expected to hold steady on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S&P 500 technology led gains among sectors, while healthcare was the biggest decliner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It’s all about technology and the winners continue to be the winners, specifically Nvidia," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street has been hitting records recently as investors bet the US central bank could kick off interest-rate cuts this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations for the timing of rate cuts have see-sawed, with policymakers wary as data still reflects sticky inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The retail sector will also be in focus this week, with several retailers due to report results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US trading moves to a shorter settlement on Tuesday, which regulators hope will reduce risk and improve efficiency, but is expected to temporarily increase transaction failures for investors. (Reuters)

    OpenAI unveils safety and security group

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some critics have raised safety concerns over OpenAI's chatbots as they become increasingly powerful. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755112_1_20240529002543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI has formed a Safety and Security Committee that will be led by board members, including CEO Sam Altman, as it begins training its next artificial intelligence model, the AI startup said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Directors Bret Taylor, Adam D'Angelo and Nicole Seligman will also lead the committee, OpenAI said on a company blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft-backed OpenAI's chatbots with generative AI capabilities, such as engaging in human-like conversations and creating images based on text prompts, have stirred safety concerns as AI models become powerful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new committee will be responsible for making recommendations to the board on safety and security decisions for OpenAI's projects and operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A new safety committee signifies OpenAI completing a move to becoming a commercial entity, from a more undefined non-profit-like entity," said D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That should help streamline product development while maintaining accountability."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, who were leaders of OpenAI's Superalignment team, which ensured AI stays aligned to the intended objectives, left the firm earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OpenAI had disbanded the Superalignment team, earlier in May, less than a year after the company created it, with some team members being reassigned to other groups, CNBC reported days after the high-profile departures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's first task will be to evaluate and further develop OpenAI’s existing safety practices over the next 90 days, following which it will share recommendations with the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the board's review, OpenAI will publicly share an update on adopted recommendations, the company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others on the committee include newly appointed Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki and Matt Knight, head of security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company will also consult other experts, including Rob Joyce, a former US National Security Agency cybersecurity director and John Carlin, a former Department of Justice official.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OpenAI did not provide further details on the new "frontier" model it is training, except that it would bring its systems to the "next level of capabilities on our path to AGI."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in May, it announced a new AI model capable of realistic voice conversation and interaction across text and image. (Reuters)

    Shanghai rolls out measures to boost property market

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Shanghai have unveiled a set of measures to provide further targeted support for homebuyers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nine measures unveiled on Monday aim to meet the diversified living needs of residents, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include easing home-purchase restrictions further for non-Shanghai residents and divorced couples, and allowing families with two or more children to purchase an additional home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai also said it would reduce the minimum down payment for commercial housing mortgages to 20 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement followed similar moves in major cities such as Hangzhou and Xi'an this month, reducing purchase restrictions for first-time buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many mainland cities had imposed restrictions and tough credit requirements on home purchases well over a decade ago in an effort to tamp down soaring prices and speculation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they are now reversing those policies in a bid to stem an economic slump characterised by a debt crisis among developers, low demand and falling prices. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group rallied as much as 95 percent on Monday morning after the firm resumed trading following a share transfer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company, which is the EV unit of embattled property developer China Evergrande, on Sunday said 29 percent of its shares, or 3.14 billion, were expected to immediately change hands after liquidators reached a preliminary agreement with an unidentified buyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal, subject to due diligence, includes an option for the buyer to take an additional 29.5 percent of the shares, or about 3.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market value of the total shares involved is about HK$2.41 billion, based on the HK$0.38 per share before the trading suspension on May 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing on Sunday, also includes a possible credit line to be arranged by the buyer to finance the company’s ongoing operations and the development of its electric vehicle businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of the EV unit rallied to HK$0.74 per share shortly after its trading resumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EV maker is faced with a severe shortage of capital, with its Tianjin factory having ceased production at the beginning of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been struggling since its parent firm got sucked into a property crisis in China in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trading in the shares of Evergrande remains suspended.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Profits of China's major industrial firms increased 4.3 percent year on year in the first four months of the year, official data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth rate was the same with that registered in the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For April alone, profits were up 4 percent, versus a 3.5 percent slide in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial firms with an annual main business revenue of at least 20 million yuan saw their combined profits reach 2.09 trillion yuan during the January-April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pickup in earnings followed export-led growth in factory output over the past month while retail sales unexpectedly slowed, underscoring uneven recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Domestic effective demand remains insufficient while the external environment is still complicated and severe," said NBS statistician Wei Ning in a separate statement, noting that the foundation for improvement in industrial profits needs to be consolidated. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained lost ground on Friday to trade higher ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend, with renewed enthusiasm for generative AI-linked companies pushing Nvidia's share price.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished the day up 1.1 percent to 16,920, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,304.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones stabilised after tumbling on Thursday to close almost unchanged at 39,069.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While stocks often rise ahead of the Memorial day weekend, Friday's buoyant trading day also had Nvidia's recent streak to thank, said Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company, which sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in many generative AI products, saw its share price rise 2.6 percent on Friday, leaving it up more than 15 percent this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know that expectations were very high, and yet they seem to meet or exceed them on more than one level," he said. "So whether we like it or not, artificial intelligence now is an important factor when it comes to the stock market sentiment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And to the extent that Nvidia's numbers were able to meet or beat expectations that's supportive for the market," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other tech companies that saw their share price jump on Friday include Advanced Micro Devices, which closed up 3.7 percent, and Intel, which finished 2.1 percent higher. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished sharply lower on Thursday after blowout earnings by Nvidia failed to ignite a broad rally.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stocks had opened higher, but analysts cited an uptick in US Treasury bond yields as a driver of the reversal. Market watchers also noted a tendency in equities to sell off after big rallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You've had huge runs since mid-April and there's an inclination to take some money off the table," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 1.5 percent at 39,065.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 slid 0.7 percent to 5,267, while the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent to 16,736.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, artificial intelligence player Nvidia surged 9.3 percent after reporting a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live Nation Entertainment dropped 7.8 percent after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit, arguing the company, which owns ticketing behemoth Ticketmaster, should be broken up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing plunged 7.6 percent after the company's CFO predicted another quarter of meagre plane deliveries, likely resulting in negative cash for all of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail company VF, which owns Timberland and other outdoor apparel brands, fell 2.9 percent after reporting a US$418.3 million loss in the most recent quarter. The company said a turnround is on track. (AFP)

    US sues to dismantle Ticketmaster-owner Live Nation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754458_1_20240524041833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Justice filed a major antitrust lawsuit on Thursday seeking to break up the alleged monopoly held by Live Nation Entertainment and its Ticketmaster subsidiary in the live music industry.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York, alleges that Live Nation has abused its dominant market position to raise ticket fees, squeeze out competitors and limit choices for fans, venues and artists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators," said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is time to break up Live Nation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticketmaster's pricing practices for concerts and sports events, with high fees and lack of alternatives, have long been a political issue in the United States, with little done historically to open up the market to more competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest controversy over Ticketmaster's dominance came when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour went on pre-sale in November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widespread outages and exorbitant fees caused an uproar, with lawmakers in Washington holding hearings to question Live Nation-Ticketmaster executives over the debacle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move by US officials against Live Nation also came as the Biden administration, according to polls, is seen by voters as failing to do enough to curb inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High prices have become a key issue in battleground states ahead of the 2024 election that pits Biden against former president Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Live Nation said the lawsuit "won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Calling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live Nation, which merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, has grown into a US$22 billion global giant that produces over 30,000 concerts annually for nearly 500 touring artists across its network of over 265 venues in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has fought back against allegations it harms the ticketing industry, saying it brought innovation and lower prices because of its national reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the DOJ counters that US fans still pay higher fees with "outdated technology" compared to other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawsuit detailed allegations of unlawful tactics by Live Nation to maintain its dominance, including "threatening and retaliating against venues" by signalling they could lose concerts and revenue if they work with rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 68-page suit paints Live Nation-Ticketmaster as operating a "self-reinforcing business model" that allows it to capture revenue from ticket sales and then use that revenue to lock up artists to exclusive promotion deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It then leverages its access to top performers to sign venues into long-term exclusive ticketing deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fights against Ticketmaster's power go back to the 1990s, when the rock band Pearl Jam refused to perform at Ticketmaster venues in protest at its service charges that increased ticket prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticketmaster was accused of organising a boycott of Pearl Jam's tour, and the band eventually gave up its campaign against the ticketing giant. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Nvidia easily beat Wall Street estimates as its profits and revenues skyrocketed, boosted by its chipmaking dominance which has made the company an icon of the artificial intelligence boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its net income rose more than sevenfold compared to a year earlier, jumping to US$14.88 billion in its first quarter that ended April 28 from US$2.04 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue more than tripled, rising to US$26.04 billion from US$7.19 billion in the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The next industrial revolution has begun,” CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centre he called “AI factories” designed to produce “a new commodity — artificial intelligence.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huang added that training AI models was becoming a faster process as they learn to become “multimodal” — that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data — and also “to reason and plan.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company reported earnings per share — adjusted to exclude one-time items — of US$6.12, well above the US$5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares in Nvidia Corp rose 6 percent in after-hours trading to US$1,006.89.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s stock has risen more than 200 percent in the past year. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday following mixed earnings reports as Federal Reserve meeting minutes highlighted inflation worries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities spent much of the day essentially flat, but tripped into the red after the Fed minutes showed that policy makers were frustrated with the lack of progress in bringing inflation towards the central bank's two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said the concerns were unsurprising given the mindset of the Fed at the May 1 meeting, but that the release served as an excuse for investors to sell after a big rally since the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.5 percent at 39,671.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 0.3 percent to 5,307, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,801, pulling back after two straight records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Target slumped 8.0 percent after reporting a drop of 3.7 percent in comparable sales in the first quarter. The big-box retailer characterised the results as being in line with expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lululemon Athletica dropped 7.2 percent after announcing a number of executive reassignments following the departure of Chief Product Officer Sun Choe, who is leaving for another career opportunity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Moderna surged 13.7 percent after announcing that it had been cleared to present abstracts at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, which begins on May 31 in Chicago. (AFP)

    US home sales slip on still high mortgage rates

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mortgage rates have surged in recent years as the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked the benchmark lending rate to tackle stubborn inflation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Existing home sales in the United States crept lower in April as mortgage rates remained elevated, industry data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales of previously owned homes dipped by 1.9 percent from March, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million, said the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected a slight uptick last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Home sales changed little overall, but the upper-end market is experiencing a sizeable gain due to more supply coming onto the market," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total housing inventory at the end of April was up nine percent from March, and was 16.3 percent higher than the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage rates have surged in recent years as the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked the benchmark lending rate to tackle stubborn inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, the central bank continues to hold rates steady as it seeks to stamp out price increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of May 16, the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02 percent, up from 6.39 percent a year prior, according to home loan finance firm Freddie Mac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-May 2021, the rate was around three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher rates have weighed on transactions, as homeowners who locked in lower rates previously remained reluctant to enter the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, home sales were also 1.9 percent lower in April, NAR data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median sales price in April rose 5.7 percent from a year ago to US$407,600 – the highest since June 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, however, "the pace of price increases should taper off since more housing inventory is becoming available," Yun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage demand is expected to remain tepid in the near term, given that long-term rates are still elevated, analysts from Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a recent note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect a decline in long-term rates over the next couple of months, but we also expect the labour market will start to look much weaker, slowing the growth in the pool of potential homebuyers," Pantheon added. (AFP)
