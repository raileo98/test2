    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street bounced back, with all three major indices ending the session higher. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765409_1_20240809043424.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Thursday in Wall Street’s latest sharp swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries about the slowing economy .
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 jumped 119.81 points, or 2.3 percent, to 5,319.31, for its best day since 2022. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683.04 points, or 1.8 percent to 39,446.49, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 464.22 points, or 2.9 percent to 16,660.02.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A week ago worse-than-expected data on unemployment claims fuelled worries that the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates at too high for too long. That sent markets reeling, along with a rate hike by the Bank of Japan that hit the carry trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the worst of it, at least so far, the S&P 500 was down about 9 percent from its all-time set last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the market’s swings look more like a “positioning-driven crash” caused by too many investors piling into similar trades and then exiting them together, rather than the start of a long-term downward market caused by a recession, according to strategists at BNP Paribas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say it looks more similar to the “flash crash” of 2010 than the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 recession caused by the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of course, markets have been quick to turn over the past week regardless of any long-term predictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Today’s jobless claims data may ease some of the concerns raised by last week’s soft jobs report,” said Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. “But with inflation data due out next week and the stock market still working through its biggest pullback of the year, it’s unclear how much this will move the sentiment needle.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the meantime, big US companies continue to turn in profit reports for the spring that are mostly better than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Big Tech stocks also rose to claw back some of their sharp losses from the last month. (AP)

    Apple says it's falling into line with new EU rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The EU is also investigating Apple over changes previously made to comply with new European digital laws by allowing third-party app stores. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765399_1_20240809022302.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday announced changes to its App Store after the European Union accused the iPhone maker of breaking the bloc's landmark new digital rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU said the App Store terms prevented app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative ways to pay, making Apple the first ever tech firm to face accusations of breaching a new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now Apple says there will be changes to comply with the DMA and address the findings of the European Commission, the EU's powerful antitrust regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels at the time said developers could only steer customers through a link in their app that redirected the user to a web page to conclude any contracts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regulators said Apple placed "several restrictions" meaning app developers could not communicate, promote offers and conclude contracts through the channel of their choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the autumn, Apple said developers in the EU "can communicate and promote offers for purchases" wherever they want, for example, via an alternative app marketplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in Thursday's announcement, Apple said the changes mean developers will have a new fee structure for customers linking out of an app for offers and content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For instance, developers will have to pay a five-percent fee on sales of digital goods and services made on any platforms within a year of a user first installing an app with the ability to link out to a different channel such as a website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the big tech firms modify their platforms in accordance with EU rules, they can avoid large penalties. The DMA demands the EU wrap up any probe within a year of its start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission told AFP it "will assess Apple's eventual changes to the compliance measures, also taking into account any feedback from the market, notably developers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges against Apple came after the commission launched investigations in March into Apple, Facebook owner Meta and Google under the DMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta also faced formal accusations of violating the DMA in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DMA gives big tech a list of what they can and can't do in business in a bid to increase competition in the digital sphere. For example, they must offer choice screens for web browsers and search engines to give users more options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law gives the EU the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. This can rise to up to 20 percent for repeat offenders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also faces daily penalties of up to five percent of its average daily worldwide turnover if found to be non-compliant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Coalition for App Fairness, whose members include Swedish streaming giant Spotify and which has long called for Apple to open up its marketplace, dismissed the latest Apple announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the introduction of yet another confusing, arbitrary, and expensive fee structure, Apple continues to evade compliance and make the digital landscape in Europe more complicated for developers and more costly for consumers," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU is also investigating Apple over changes previously made to comply with the DMA by allowing third-party app stores. (AFP)

    FTX ordered to pay customers almost US$13bn

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A US court has ordered bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX to pay US$12.7 billion in relief to its customers, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  FTX drew customers in with "an illusion that it was a safe and secure place to access crypto markets," then misappropriated their customer deposits to make its own risky investments, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The repayment order implements a settlement between the CFTC and the bankrupt crypto exchange, which has committed to a bankruptcy liquidation that will repay customers whose deposits were locked during its late 2022 collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX has said its customers will receive 100 percent recovery on their claims against the company, based on the value of their accounts at the time it filed for bankruptcy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CFTC agreement resolves a potential roadblock to that repayment, ensuring that the government's lawsuit against FTX will not reduce the funds available to its customers. The CFTC agreed not to collect any payment from FTX until all its customers are repaid, with interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CFTC settlement requires FTX to pay US$8.7 billion in restitution and US$4 billion in disgorgement, which will be used to further compensate victims for losses suffered during the exchange's collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for stealing US$8 billion from customers. He has appealed the conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX has used its bankruptcy to reach settlements with US regulators and former business partners and to sell assets that had been purchased with misappropriated customer funds, including real estate and investments in crypto and other tech companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX is currently soliciting votes on its bankruptcy proposal but faces opposition from some customers who feel short-changed by the decision to repay them based on much-lower cryptocurrency prices from November 2022. Votes are due on August 16, and FTX intends to seek final approval of its wind-down plan on October 7. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished lower on Wednesday after an early rally petered out, in a sign of lingering unease after recent equity market weakness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is what happens when you have a big risk-off type of event," Steve Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers, said of Monday's equity market plunge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's normal to see the market display uncertainty," said Sosnick, who pointed to a poorly received US Treasury bond auction as further evidence of investor angst.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 38,763.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,199, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.1 percent to 16,195.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices sank more than 2.5 percent on Monday amid worries over a potential US recession and the unwinding of the so-called "carry trade" that took advantage of the weak yen prior to last week's interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many analysts expect more effects from the unwinding, extending a period of volatility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney fell 4.5 percent despite reporting better than expected earnings as investors digested commentary that a weakening of demand in the parks business "could impact the next few quarters."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airbnb slumped 13.4 percent after reporting lower than expected profits and cautioning of "some signs of slowing demand from US guests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TripAdvisor also fell sharply after earnings, tumbling 16.7 percent. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Wednesday announced an interim dividend due to its strong performance in the first six months of 2024, despite reporting a drop in first-half profit from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm added that a decrease in profit for its airlines and subsidiaries was "principally attributable to the normalisation of ticket prices".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group recorded a 14 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our strong performance for the first six months of the year was primarily driven by the ongoing robust demand for travel, and the solid performance of our cargo business," said the airline's chairman Patrick Healy in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This result has allowed us to announce a first interim dividend payment to ordinary shareholders of HK$0.20 per ordinary share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay's budget arm, HK Express, reported a loss of HK$73 million in the first half of the year, following earnings of HK$333 million in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive Officer Ronald Lam said the low-cost carrier had been facing engine issues and regional competition, but he remained confident in the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of those aircraft are on ground and not being able to generate revenue for HK Express in the short term," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second issue HK Express is facing short-term, is the very keen competition among short-haul carriers based in Hong Kong, as well as the foreign low-cost carriers flying into Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Healy said the company is on track to reach 100 percent of its pre-pandemic flight levels within the first quarter of 2025 as it enters "the final stretch" of its rebuilding journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are increasing our group headcount by 5,000 to a total of 29,000 people by the end of this year to support this pace of growth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline had also bought back HK$19.5 billion in preference shares acquired by the government as part of a bailout package to stay afloat, and said it would continue to maintain a lower level of liquidity than it did during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of its fleet, Cathay said it would buy 30 Airbus A330-900 wide-body aircraft, with an option to purchase 30 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not disclose the purchase price but said it received "significant price concessions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The basic price is about US$11 billion, or roughly HK$85.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These new regional wide-body aircraft are expected to be delivered from 2028 and will join the Cathay Pacific fleet, principally serving destinations in Asia. We now have more than 100 new-generation aircraft in our delivery pipeline, with the rights to acquire 80 additional aircraft in future," Healy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The purchase of Airbus aircraft is part of an investment drive of more than HK$100 billion over the next seven years, which also includes newly designed lounges and cabin products.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Growth in China's exports slowed last month while imports returned to the black, customs data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Exports were up 7 percent in July year on year after posting an 8.6 percent increase the month before, the strongest rise in 15 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's figure was the weakest since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of the year taken together, exports rose 6.7 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, rose at a robust 7.2 percent last month, compared with a 2.3 percent contraction in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's imports growth was the fastest in three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports climbed 5.4 percent in the January-July period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus narrowed to US$84.65 billion in July from US$99.05 billion in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, the trade surplus expanded by 7.9 percent year on year to US$518 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns remained for the world's second-largest economy after second-quarter GDP growth slowed to 4.7 percent from 5.3 percent in the January-March period, keeping alive calls for policymakers to roll out more support to reach the government's full-year growth target of around 5 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong market opened stronger on Wednesday, taking its cue from Wall Street, which partially rebounded from a sell-off in the previous session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index was up 37.44 points, or 0.22 percent, at 16,684.78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the United States, investors returned to the market after soothing comments by Federal Reserve officials eased US recession worries, with the S&P and the Nasdaq both gaining more than one percent, and the Dow rising 0.8 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rebounded on Tuesday after three straight days of losses, with analysts pointing to bargain hunting and US bond markets bouncing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gains in New York also followed a quieter day in most overseas stock markets and came as Caterpillar and Uber reported solid earnings, lifting shares of both companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm hopeful that we'll get some stability back," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that there could still be "a little more downside risks to the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.8 percent at 38,997.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.0 percent to 5,240, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 1.0 percent to 16,366.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices fell more than 2.5 percent on Monday in a move seen as a reflection of worries about a US recession following Friday's disappointing jobs data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market watchers have also pointed to ripple effects from Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and have led to liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei, which slumped 12.4 percent on Monday, jumped 10.2 percent on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reversal in the US equity market came as US Treasury bond yields climbed and as a closely-watched volatility index retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Caterpillar gained 3.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as strong pricing offset the hit from lower revenues. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered a bruising rout on Monday, extending a pullback attributed to economic unease and fallout from recent lurches in overseas financial markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major indices spent the entire day in the red, with the Dow Jones losing 2.6 percent, or more than 1,000 points, to finish at 38,703.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 3.0 percent to end at 5,186, while the Nasdaq dropped 3.4 percent to 16,200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses followed down days last Thursday and Friday on the heels of poor US employment data and a negative survey from manufacturers that sparked worries about a recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seizing on that point, some market watchers have called for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates – perhaps even in an emergency meeting – after the central bank kept rates unchanged last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But market watchers are also focusing on the ripple effects of Japan's decision last week to hike interest rates, which boosted the yen and slammed Japan's Nikkei equity market, which dove 12.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an abrupt move in a market that has a lot of tentacles," Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said of the Japan currency shift, which is believed to have led to speedy liquidations in other markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan believes the Japan currency movements are much more a factor in the turbulence than recession fears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survey results of services companies by the Institute for Supply Management showed stronger than expected growth, boosting US Treasury bond yields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts at High Frequency Economics called the report "a refreshingly stronger-than-expected outcome" that helps to counter the gloom from last week's economic data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether it will turn around the US equity sell-off is to be determined, of course," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet dropped 4.6 percent after a US judge sided with antitrust officials who had alleged that the company operated a monopoly with its dominant search engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also had a bad day, losing 4.8 percent on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had cut its stake in the tech giant. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bank of China (Hong Kong) said the outlook for the SAR and mainland economies is positive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said the local economy is seeing a stable recovery, with strong inbound tourist figures and low unemployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also said retail sales remained weak and housing prices could drop "by a small margin" this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the world's second-largest economy, the bank believes it will reach its 5 percent growth target for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still believe that the growth rate in China will eventually translate to the growth rate in China's enterprise sector, I mean all the corporates in China," said Ding Meng, senior economist of Bank of China (Hong Kong).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we are anticipating the improvement of the profits prospect in China-related investments, so we are kind of positive for the stock market here in Hong Kong and also in mainland China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank also said it expects the US Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in September or December this year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP says hot weather led to increased electricity demand. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764812_1_20240805153704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday announced a mid-year net profit of HK$5.95 billion, a near 18 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company said Hong Kong’s accelerated economic recovery, along with hotter weather, led to increased electricity demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Australian and Indian business also improved, offsetting the impact of reduced electricity generation at its nuclear power plants on the mainland due to scheduled maintenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP also pointed to various renewable energy projects on the mainland, saying they will be the key drivers for its profit in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s revenue rose to HK$44.09 billion, an almost 2 percent increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.63 per share, matching the first interim dividend of the year and unchanged from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have always been generating revenue and dividends for the benefit of our shareholders. And we adopt a policy to have a reliable and consistent dividend with steady growth supported by sustainable business development,” said CLP's chief executive officer TK Chiang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we will continue to grow the business and if the condition approves, of course, we will try to adjust our dividend. But at the end of the day, the dividend will be approved by the board.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiang also said any further reduction in prices for consumers in the remainder of the year will depend on the international fuel market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because of the continued easing of the energy prices globally, we saw tariff reduction. From January up to August, the tariff for CLP's customers in Hong Kong saw a reduction of about 2 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the remaining part of the year, it will really depend on the international fuel price trend. If the fuel price continues to follow the current trend, there could be an opportunity for further adjustments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about progress in reviewing its power management system following several voltage dips this year, Chiang said the company is working on solutions to minimise the impact such incidents have on customers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff, driven by last week's plunge in global stock markets, economic concerns and worries investments funded by a cheap yen were being unwound.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei share average shed a staggering 12.4 percent as Friday's dismal US jobs data heightened worries of a possible recession, and as the yen rallied to seven-month highs versus the US dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's banking stocks led the rout, which pushed the Nikkei into bear market territory given its 27 percent drop from a July 11 peak of 42,426.77.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the close on Monday, the index closed at 31,458.42 and had wiped out 113 trillion yen (US$792.32 billion) of that peak market value.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it's also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks," said Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com in Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nikkei lost 4,451.28 points on Monday, its biggest ever one-day drop, eclipsing the 3,836.48 points it lost on Oct 20, 1987 when the Black Monday global stock market crash hit Japanese markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks sold off for a second straight session on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite index confirmed it was in correction territory after a soft jobs report stoked fears of an oncoming recession and expectations for a big Federal Reserve rate cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the US economic slowdown worries were too much, but the market did turn nervous after the Bank of Japan's rate hike as they thought the domestic economy is not strong enough to justify the rate hike," said Tomochika Kitaoka, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yen was last up 2.5 percent at 142.96 per dollar, and has risen 14 percent in less than a month, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's interest rate rise last week and an unwinding of yen-funded carry trades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The banking sector slumped 17 percent to become the worst sector among the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33 industry sub-indexes.

    Cathay to increase flights to Phnom Penh

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cathay Pacific says it will step up flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764594_2_20240803172132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Saturday announced it will offer daily flights to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh from October 27, up from the current five trips per week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came after the CEO of the SAR's flag carrier, Ronald Lam, signed an agreement to boost its partnership with Cambodia Airports during Chief Executive John Lee's recent six-day Asean trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision is also part of Cathay's plan to prepare for the completion of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group emphasised that it will continue to strengthen its existing routes, as well as expand its network and collaboration with Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, this year marks the 75th anniversary since Cathay operated its inaugural flight to Vietnam. The airline announced that it will kick off another round of recruitment in the country this month, after welcoming more than 170 Vietnamese flight attendants earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And low-cost airline Hong Kong Express, which is owned by Cathay, is planning to start flights between Hong Kong and Phu Quoc – a Vietnamese island – in the fourth quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay currently flies to 17 Asean destinations, with over 360 flights per week.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street took a dive on Friday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764530_1_20240803044225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday following a disappointing US jobs report that raised recession worries while also boosting the odds of interest rate cuts by the Fed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US economy added 114,000 jobs last month, a drop from the prior month and fewer than expected, while the jobless rate rose to 4.3 percent, the highest level since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report added to recession fears following lacklustre manufacturing data on Thursday, with losses in the week's final two days leaving all three major indices down for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 39,737, down 1.5 percent for the day and 2.1 percent for the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 fell 1.8 percent to 5,346, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.4 percent to 16,776.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Historically it's very difficult to achieve a soft landing," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. "It's easy for a soft landing to sneak up on you and become a hard landing. And that's what the market is very much afraid of right now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said the market is likely overreacting to a few weak data points, noting that most of the corporate earnings released in the last few weeks have been solid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are ready to shoot first and ask questions later," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Intel shares sank more than 26 percent after the US chip maker announced it would cut more than 15 percent of its workforce while reporting a US$1.6 billion quarterly loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon also had a bad day, losing nearly nine percent on worries about the tech giant's profit outlook after revenues fell short of expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Apple advanced 0.7 percent after reporting quarterly profit of US$21.4 billion, besting analyst forecasts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coca-Cola rose 2.0 percent as it announced plans to pay a tax penalty worth US$6 billion while it pursues an appeal in a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soft drinks giant had previously said the dispute could potentially involve a liability of US$16 billion. (AFP)

    Weak jobs data sparks worries about US economy

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data shows US unemployment edging up to 4.3 percent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764508_1_20240803000230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with sustained higher interest rates taking a toll on businesses and consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Friday’s report from the US Labor Department showed that employers added just 114,000 jobs in July – 35 percent fewer than forecasters had expected – and that unemployment, now up to 4.3 percent, was the highest since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Things are deteriorating quickly,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news shook financial markets around the world, with the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq both dropping sharply at the open of trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sturdiness of the US economy — the world’s largest — has been a key driver of global economic growth and the US jobs market is a big reason for it, underpinning the American expansion and giving consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unemployment rate's jump to 4.3 percent in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signalled that the United States is in recession — though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the topsy-turvy post-pandemic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weak jobs report came two days after the Federal Reserve said it would hold off on cutting interest rates until it sees more evidence that inflation is continuing to move down and closer to its 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterised the American job market as healthy, despite growing calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high, to pre-empt a major weakening of the US economy and job market. (AP)

 The Hang Seng Index on Friday was down about 1.4 percent, or 240 points, in early trading at 17,064.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sell-off came after Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday following weak manufacturing data, sparking worries about a US recession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, European stocks had slumped on disappointing bank earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major US indices finished decisively lower, with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index falling the most at 2.3 percent.

  Markets will get another key US economic data point on Friday with monthly jobs data. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

    Wall Street ends down on jitters over manufacturing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street initially opened stronger, but changed direction after manufacturing data raised concerns about the economy. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764341_1_20240802042650.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks kicked off August sharply lower after a round of economic data on Thursday spurred concerns the economy may be slowing faster than anticipated while the Federal Reserve maintains a restrictive monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities initially opened higher, partly lifted by Meta Platforms after its quarterly results topped expectations and the Facebook parent issued an upbeat outlook for the third quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the early gains evaporated after data showed a measure of manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) dropped to an eight-month low in July at 46.8, signifying contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What you’re seeing now, and you will probably see it for the next month or two, is some kind of consolidation and sideways price action," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bigger picture bull trend is intact ... But we're in a period now where the market is kind of digesting its gains sideways, back and forth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 lost 75.62 points, or 1.4 percent, to end at 5,446.68, the Nasdaq Composite lost 405.26 points, or 2 .3 percent, to 17,194.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 494.82 points, or 1.2 percent, to 40,347.97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  August is typically one of the weakest months of the year for stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other data showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labour market, although seasonal factors also played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will eye government payroll data later on Friday for signs of further weakness in the labour market. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of England on Thursday cut its main interest rate for the first time since the pandemic broke out in 2020, as British inflation has retreated in recent months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a tight 5-4 vote, BoE policymakers agreed to reduce borrowing costs by a quarter-point to 5.0 percent, the central bank announced following a regular meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Andrew Bailey joined four other policymakers in bringing the rate down from a 16-year high, which will ease pressure on borrowers while denting interest earned by savers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail banks tend to mirror the direction of BoE policy when setting their own interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Inflationary pressures have eased enough that we've been able to cut interest rates," Bailey said in a short statement. "But we need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's annual inflation rate has returned to the BoE target of two percent, after soaring to a four-decade high above 11 percent in late 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its key lending rate unchanged, but noted "some further progress" had been made in bringing inflation down. It is expected to cut in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the BoE's action Thursday, analysts said they expected the British central bank to cut again this year, but maybe not as early as next month. That helped the pound claw back earlier losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, the European Central Bank has started to trim rates as gains to prices of global goods and services have largely slowed in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, the Bank of Japan on Wednesday hiked borrowing costs for only the second time in 17 years amid a pickup in the country's inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's rate cut comes less than one month after the country elected a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour administration has vowed to grow the UK economy but has already warned that state spending will be hampered by tight finances. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 9.7 percent to HK$29.9 billion in June, government data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, total retail sales were down 6.6 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman attributed the decline to changing consumer behaviour among both visitors and residents, as well as the strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said the rate of decline narrowed further in June, signalling a stabilisation in retail activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the spokesman pointed to ongoing challenges for the sector in the near term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said central government initiatives benefiting Hong Kong and the SAR government's efforts to support the retail sector through mega-events would help retailers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will actively expand domestic demand and put consumption promotion at a more prominent position in the next step, Yuan Da, a senior official with the National Development and Reform Commission, told a press conference on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The state planner will launch efforts to boost consumption of major commodities such as automobiles and home appliances, and to improve and expand the quality and capacity of service consumption in education, elderly care, child care and domestic services, Yuan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support will be given to the high-quality development of cultural and sports tourism, Yuan said, adding that measures will be optimised to make travel in China more convenient and comfortable for foreign visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also expressed confidence that China will achieve its full-year economic growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is "sufficient" room for counter-cyclical policy adjustments, said Zhao Chenxin, vice head of the state planner. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday kept its base rate at 5.75 percent, after the US Federal Reserve ended a two-day meeting leaving its key rate unchanged.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the first interest rate cut could come as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the HKMA said “inflation pressure in the US has somewhat abated lately, and the market expects that the easing cycle might begin soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it added that the pace of any easing remains uncertain, and said the interbank offered rate in Hong Kong might stay high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said in a statement.

 The Hang Seng Index fell 16.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to open at 17,327.85 points on Thursday, following its 2 percent rise on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Overnight, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell said interest rates could be cut as soon as September if the US economy follows its expected path, putting the central bank near the end of a more than two-year battle against inflation. The Fed ended its latest two-day policy meeting with a decision to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the 5.25-5.50 percent range that was set a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it was keeping its base rate at 5.75 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve signalled it could cut interest rates as soon as September, with technology shares leading the way.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Fed delivered what the markets anticipated in terms of opening the door to a rate cut in September without overcommitting," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major US indices spent almost the entire day in positive territory, hitting peaks during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference before edging down a bit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index led major indices, winning 2.6 percent to finish at 17,599.40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 percent to 40,842.79, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.6 percent to 5,522.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, Fed policymakers voted unanimously to maintain interest rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Powell told a news conference that the first interest rate cut could come "as soon as" the Fed's next rate meeting in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is beginning to feel more comfortable that inflation is beginning to come down," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Capital. "The Fed feels that it can finally get control of inflation, there is a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Semiconductor shares enjoyed a buoyant session, with artificial intelligence player Nvidia rocketing up 12.8 percent and Broadcom and Micron also advancing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing gained 2.1 percent despite reporting a bigger than expected loss as the troubled aviation company named Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO. The appointment won praise from analysts who said Ortberg's extensive aerospace experience would bolster a turnaround.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft fell 1.1 percent despite reporting a 10 percent jump in quarterly profit to US$22 billion. Analysts said a crucial cloud computing unit did not grow as strongly as expected. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Futures traders believe there's a 60 percent probability that the US Federal Reserve will make cuts of at least 0.75 percentage points this year. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764143_1_20240801024613.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve left its key lending rate unchanged again on Wednesday and said it had made "some further progress" in its inflation fight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After two days of deliberations, policymakers voted unanimously to maintain the US central bank's benchmark interest rate between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement -- keeping rates at a 23-year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a small uptick in inflation earlier this year, recent data suggest the Fed's mission of bringing inflation back down to its long-term target of 2 percent is now firmly back on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its favoured measure of headline inflation eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent last month, while economic growth has remained resilient, and the labour market has come into better balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent months, there has been some further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective," the Fed said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks a slight change in tone from its decision in June, when it noted only that "modest further progress" had been made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance," the Fed said, adding that it was "attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the most recent rate decision in June, Fed officials responded to a small uptick in inflation by lowering the number of cuts they penciled in for this year from three down to just one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But since then, the official figures have painted a better picture, and futures traders now assign a probability of around 60 percent that the US central bank will make at least 0.75 percentage-points of cuts this year, according to CME Group data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cuts are expected to come in the form of three separate quarter-point moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the Fed does move in September, its decision would thrust the independent US central bank into the middle of the 2024 presidential election battle between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has accused Powell -- who he nominated -- of displaying political favouritism towards the Democratic party, and suggested that he would not reappoint the central banker as Fed chair if he wins in November. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing named former Rockwell Collins chief Robert "Kelly" Ortberg its next CEO on Wednesday, as the planemaker reported a loss on continued operational problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ortberg, 64, helped lead Rockwell Collins and integrate it into United Technology prior to his retirement from RTX in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment comes as Boeing attempts to rebound from a series of safety and quality control problems that have sharpened scrutiny on the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg "is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry," said Boeing chairman Steve Mollenkopf in a message to employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ortberg is set to become CEO on August 8, taking over for Dave Calhoun, a former General Electric and private equity executive who has held the post since early 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We look forward to working with Kelly as he leads Boeing through this consequential period in our long history," Mollenkopf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing on Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss of US$1.4 billion, compared with a loss of US$149 million in the year-ago period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenues fell 14.6 percent to US$16.9 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterly results reflected a continued drag from Boeing's commercial division, where it has lowered production while addressing safety and quality control issues under the close watch of regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has been in the hot seat since a January incident in which a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest results also showed significant weakness in its defence business due to a number of fixed price contracts where it has experienced deep losses due to supply chain problems, as well as higher engineering costs and technical issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's press release listed four defence contracts behind an operating loss of US$913 million in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we have more work ahead, the steps we're taking will help stabilize our operations," Calhoun said. "We are making important progress in our recovery and will continue to build trust through action and transparency." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official advance estimates released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compares with a revised 2.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed the second quarter growth to an increase in exports and investment spending, saying it expects the economy to continue to expand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year, but performance of the different economic segments may vary amid uncertainties on various fronts," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions, escalating trade conflicts, and US interest rate trajectory remaining not entirely clear may add uncertainties to economic sentiment and activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Natixis Asia Pacific economist Gary Ng said the figure for the second quarter was slightly higher than he expected, but pressures still remain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the other components, such as the contraction in the household spending and also the greater growth in the import of services, which is basically reflecting the outbound tourism and also the rebound in investment, which basically just get back to the pre-Covid level and is still 16 percent lower than 2018 for the same period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think these are all the sorts of pressures that I would see within the economy that can actually drag the growth rate further in the future."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Holdings on Wednesday said its first-half pre-tax profit came in at US$21.6 billion, a 0.5 percent decline compared to the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it will pay an interim dividend of 10 US cents per share, the second payment this year following the 31 US cents announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC also announced a further three-month repurchase of up to US$3 billion, following the completed US$3 billion buyback announced last quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With several major central banks seen likely to cut interest rates later this year, the group's outgoing chief executive, Noel Quinn, told an online press call that HSBC has reduced its sensitivity to interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've significantly lowered our sensitivity to interest rates. And this transformation has helped to improve our financial performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we knew that interest rate declines were going to come at some stage, we've been investing heavily in building up alternative revenue growth options, mainly around wealth, international wholesale banking and international transaction banking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incumbent chief financial officer, Georges Elhedery, will step into the chief executive role in September following Quinn's retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elhedery highlighted the bank's commitment to its core Hong Kong and UK markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bulk of our capital and resources are deployed in our four scale activities, that is Hong Kong, the UK, our international wholesale bank, which is underpinned by our leading transaction banking capabilities, and our wealth proposition, and that's in particular in Asia," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm intending to continue to grow revenue on a sustainable trajectory, intending to continue improving operating leverage, while maintaining a very strong discipline which is now embedded in the firm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has named Jonathan Bingham as the interim group chief financial officer, effective from September 2.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The tech-rich Nasdaq tumbled again while the Dow forged higher on Tuesday as investors continued to steer funds away from artificial intelligence equities toward other sectors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing so-called "rotation" from tech giants to smaller and medium-sized company comes as some of the biggest tech companies are set to report quarterly results in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, noted that this buying trend may be almost over now that Microsoft, Nvidia and others have fallen significantly from their peaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 percent to 40,743.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.5 percent to 5,436, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.3 percent to 17,147.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft reported after the market closed on Tuesday, while Apple, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta will report over the next two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This rotation likely stops when we get the majority of these mega caps to report," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Procter & Gamble dropped 4.9 percent as it reported a seven percent fall in quarterly profits on flat sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowdstrike also plunged nearly 10 percent following reports Delta hired attorney David Boies to seek damages following an IT outage that threw the airline's operations into turmoil for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the deluge of corporate earnings, this week's calendar includes Wednesday's Fed decision, as well as monthly US employment data on Friday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Monday following a choppy session to open a news-jammed week that includes major tech earnings and a Federal Reserve decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Investors are adopting a wait-and-see posture ahead of quarterly results from Microsoft, Apple and other tech giants, as well as a Wednesday Fed decision, analysts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but could hint at a rate cut at its next meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.1 percent at 40,539.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.1 percent at 5,463, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also won 0.1 percent at 17,370.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tech shares have been under pressure in recent weeks after leading the market for the first half of 2024, with investors shifting funds to other sectors due to concerns about excessive valuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, McDonald's gained 3.3 percent despite missing analyst estimates as the company vowed to redouble efforts to win over value-focused consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts noted the fast-food chain had fallen 17 percent prior to the results, suggesting the negative news was priced in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's agenda also includes a monthly US employment report for July. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's home prices have fallen to their lowest level in almost eight years, with analysts predicting a further slump in the property market due to high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Monday showed that private flat prices fell about 1.2 percent in June, pulling the official index down from 305.6 in May to 301.8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices also dropped for the second straight month, plunging to their lowest since September 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, senior director and head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said high interest rates and the inventory of unsold units will continue to affect the city's property market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still expect the prices to go down a little bit in the second half of the year. But the price drop will be narrowed, because people are expecting the US to cut the rates later this year, and it will increase the market confidence for some of the buyers... Across the whole year, the price drop will be about five percent," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents rose nearly 0.2 percent month-on-month in June to the highest level in four and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said he expects rents to continue to go up steadily, saying levels are being boosted by the arrival of overseas students and people moving to Hong Kong under talent admission schemes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks cheered a benign US inflation report on Friday, powering the market to a positive conclusion to the week despite weakness in tech shares in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report showed that the personal consumption expenditures price index eased to an annual rate of 2.5 percent in June, from 2.6 percent, amounting to progress in a key US Federal Reserve indicator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut interest rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones jumped 1.6 percent to 40,589.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.1 percent to 5,459, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.0 percent to 17,357.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Wednesday, led by a rout in tech shares, which have been seen as overvalued after strong gains in the first half of 2024. Despite the Nasdaq's bounce on Friday, the index finished the week down more than two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to have slowing inflation and solid growth," conditions "consistent with a soft landing thesis," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kourkafas expects more of a "rotation" away from technology to other sectors in the upcoming period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, 3M shot up around 23 percent after reporting better-than-expected earnings and lifting its full-year profit forecast. Analysts see the industrial heavyweight as well positioned following progress on major litigation issues that have dogged the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biogen dove 7.2 percent after announcing European officials gave a negative reading on a new Alzheimer's disease treatment. Biogen and partner Eisai said they would seek a reexamination of the decision.

    US stocks mixed after strong GDP figures

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Investors were surprised by the GDP numbers, which came in well above economists' estimates. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763186_1_20240726045730.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Thursday as traders contended with corporate earnings and economic data that came in far stronger than expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy surprised analysts by growing at an annualised rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter of the year – double the level seen between January and March, and well above economists' estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 0.2 percent at 39,935, while the S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to close at 5,399.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq also finished the day in the red, declining by 0.9 percent to 17,181.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a strong economic report, so that helped boost investors' enthusiasm," Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin said. "But we also had some a mixed picture on the micro front."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had some disappointments out of Ford, American Airlines, so I think that it's creating perhaps a little tension in the market today," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, US auto giant Ford fell by 18.4 percent after missing earnings expectations, leading a sell-off in the sector that left General Motors and Stellantis down 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some cause for optimism as well on Thursday, with health care services provider Molina and digital workflow firm ServiceNow both finishing the day up, by 12.3 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors' attention is also firmly fixed on Friday's inflation data, which is sure to be closely scrutinised ahead of next week's Federal Reserve interest rate decision. (AFP)

    US rejects plan for G20 deal to tax super-rich

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Janet Yellen says all countries should make sure their taxation systems are fair and progressive. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763185_1_20240726021119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States sees no need to negotiate an international agreement on taxing the super-wealthy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, highlighting divisions on a plan that is top of the agenda at a G20 finance ministers' meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taxing the ultra-rich is a key priority of Brazil's leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who this year heads the G20 grouping of the world's major economies, the European Union and African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tax policy is very difficult to coordinate globally," Yellen told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro, ahead of an evening meeting between finance ministers to discuss the topic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't see a need or really think it's desirable to try to negotiate a global agreement on that. We think that all countries should make sure that their taxation systems are fair and progressive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen said Washington was "strongly supportive of progressive taxation, and making sure that very wealthy, high-income individuals pay their fair share."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She highlighted policies proposed by US President Joe Biden, such as a billionaires' tax, which she described as "a very worthwhile initiative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It makes sense for most countries to take this approach of progressive taxation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's search for a global agreement on taxing the richest of the rich is backed by France, Spain, South Africa, Colombia and the African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some individuals control more resources than entire countries," Lula said on Wednesday at the launch of an initiative to fight world hunger, another project topping his G20 agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His finance minister, Fernando Haddad, told local media on Wednesday that taxing billionaires would help finance the fight against hunger but "it will not be established overnight, because it is a very delicate mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global inequality has continued to widen in recent years, according to a study by the NGO Oxfam published on Thursday. The richest one percent of the world have earned more than US$40 trillion in a decade, but their taxation is at "historically" low rates, the study said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French economist Gabriel Zucman, a consultant with the G20 on taxation issues, estimates that the tax rate for billionaires represents 0.3 percent of their wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent report commissioned by the G20, he called for super-wealthy individuals to be taxed the equivalent of two percent of their fortune.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington is not the only sceptic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the eve of the G20 meeting, Germany's finance ministry said it considers the idea of a minimum wealth tax to be "irrelevant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting of finance ministers in Rio opened with a session on the global economy, as inflation slows in many parts of the world after a surge fuelled by the war in Ukraine and other factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the ministers will tackle the financing of the climate transition and debt in their last meeting before a G20 summit on November 18 and 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Founded in 1999, the Group of 20 assembles 19 of the world's largest economic powers, as well as the European Union and the African Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation was originally focused on global economic issues but has increasingly taken on other pressing challenges – even though member states do not always agree on what should be on the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's presidency said in a statement that some members of the G20 considered that crises such as the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza "have an impact on the global economy and should be addressed at the G20, while others believe that the G20 is not the place to discuss these issues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisions within the G20, of which Russia is also a member, have made drafting a joint communique at the outcome of meetings a challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last meeting of finance ministers in Sao Paulo failed to issue such a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil hopes to publish three texts after the meeting, said Tatiana Rosito, a senior official at the country's economy ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aside from a joint final communique, this would include a document on "international cooperation in tax matters" and a separate communique from Brazil on geopolitical crises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is likely, based on my experience of previous G20s," that future ministerial-level meetings will publish separate statements in this manner, European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming for a single text "would not allow us to adopt anything," she said. (AFP)

    US economy beats growth expectations in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Commerce Department says the acceleration "primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US economic growth blew past expectations in the second quarter, boosted by consumer spending and inventory building despite high interest rates, US government data showed on Thursday, after a slow start to the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy grew 2.8 percent in the April to June period, up from 1.4 percent in the first three months this year, said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial estimate was markedly above the 1.9 percent growth rate economists anticipated – a reassuring sign that consumption remains resilient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acceleration "primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and an acceleration in consumer spending," said the Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was "partly offset by a downturn in residential fixed investment," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While sectors like manufacturing and housing have been struggling after the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked interest rates in 2022 to combat surging inflation, consumption has been stronger than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This gave the economy a boost despite rates hovering at their highest levels in more than two decades – making borrowing more expensive for individuals and companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key factor underpinning consumption has been the robust labour market, which saw continued wage growth and businesses reluctant to let go of workers after difficulties in hiring during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With inflation slowing and salaries still growing, economists said consumers' real disposable income gains became bigger, allowing them to keep dipping into their wallets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the economy outperforming predictions of possible recession, President Joe Biden has struggled to assuage concerns of many Americans feeling the pinch from higher costs of living.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his shock exit from the 2024 election, it remains to be seen if that negative sentiment will transfer to his likely Democratic replacement, Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see consumption continuing to be the engine of the economy, continuing to keep economic growth on a relatively strong growth path of around two percent," said economist Matthew Martin of Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that although unemployment has been edging up, the trend has more to do with entrances into the market rather than layoffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This means it is not the start of a cycle where unemployment leads to income loss, in turn reducing spending and triggering more job losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there remain risks to the economy as unemployment tends to "shoot up" quickly, he said, noting that is not currently an expected outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's a big case to begin cutting rates in September and follow up with one every other meeting from there," he said of the US Federal Reserve's policymaking committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maintaining excessively restrictive monetary policy when the labour market appears to be fully back in balance could lead to an undesired weakening of employment growth and the economy," said EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a recent note. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Thursday cut a medium-term interest rate, marking the latest move by the authorities to boost economic growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's central bank cut the rate for its medium-term lending facility (MLF) – the interest for one-year loans to financial institutions – to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC issued 200 billion yuan in one-year loans under its MLF at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time the rate was cut was in August but the latest is the biggest since April 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marco Sun, chief financial market analyst at MUFG Bank (China), said Thursday's move could reduce the cost of financing and release cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unexpected MLF operation was also due to a large amount of MLF loans coming due, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the PBOC cut two benchmark lending rates, days after the Communist Party's third plenary session which outlined major reforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, major commercial banks announced reductions in deposit rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank was cut by 10 basis points to 1.35 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first deposit rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024. (Agencies)

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 50.22 points, or 0.29 percent, to open at 17,260.83 points on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Traders are taking a cautious stance ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures price index data, which is the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation and therefore plays a major role in its view on interest rates..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight in the US, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at multi-week lows, with the S&P snapping one of its longest streaks without a daily decline of more than 2 percent, as lacklustre Alphabet and Tesla earnings undermined investor confidence in large company names.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13. (with additional reporting by Xinhua and Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets tumbled on Wednesday following a bruising investor response to earnings from Tesla and Google parent Alphabet that added to worries about tech heavyweight equity valuations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downbeat reaction to results "feeds some angst about the mega cap stocks not being able to deliver stock performance," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, adding that even strong results next week from Apple, Amazon and other tech giants may not be received well by Wall Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a general bid to reduce exposure predicated on the idea that these stocks have run up a long way in a short time," O'Hare said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla dropped 12.3 percent after missing earnings estimates as CEO Elon Musk touted progress on robotic and artificial intelligence technology. Analysts said the results added to worries about weakening profit margins amid ebbing demand for Tesla's electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Alphabet fell 5.0 percent after topping analyst estimates in general but reporting disappointing figures for its YouTube business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among economic reports, the sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Federal Reserve's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides corporate earnings, Thursday's calendar includes the US government estimate for second-quarter growth. (AFP)

 The sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates, according to government data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New home sales in June came in at an annual, seasonally-adjusted, rate of 617,000, according to data released jointly by the US census and housing departments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was below the 621,000 rate in May, according to Wednesday's revised figures, and under the 640,000 projected by analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure refers to the number of homes sold over a whole year if sales continue at the rate seen in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median price in June was US$417,3000, up 2.5 percent from the prior reading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data follows a report that also showed a drop in sales of previously-owned homes that also missed analyst estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The June report on top of the weak May data show the "spring bounce in sales appears to have reversed," said a note from Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage rates currently stand below their four-week and 52-week average, according to Freddie Mac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, interest rates remain well above their levels for most of the last decade following a series of large Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to counter inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Fed's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New home sales are expected "to improve slightly" in the second half of the year, according to a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mortgage rates have fallen nearly 50 basis points to about 6.75 percent since early May and we expect rates to fall further as the Fed's rate cutting cycle gets underway," said the Oxford Economics note. (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index fell 14.93 points, or 0.09 percent, to open at 17,454.43 points on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank's monetary policy is back in focus ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data - the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the US, attention turned to corporate earnings, with Google parent Alphabet and electric carmaker Tesla both reporting results after Wall Street closed on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its earnings, Tesla reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits due to the effect of price cuts, while Alphabet beat revenue and profit expectations as its cloud and search ads businesses thrived. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)
