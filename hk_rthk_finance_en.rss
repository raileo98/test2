<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Figures from the General Administration of Customs show that exports grew 1.5 percent from April last year to US$292.5 billion, in line with analysts' expectations, after contracting sharply to 7.5 percent in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports in April surged 8.4 percent to US$220.15 billion – nearly double market estimates – after falling by 1.9 percent in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports from the United States jumped by nine percent, while exports fell by nearly three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$72.35 billion from US$58.55 billion in March. (Agencies)

    Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's best friend: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The friendship between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia has blossomed since SAR officials visited the Middle Eastern country two years ago, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Capital Markets Forum, co-organised by the Hong Kong and Saudi bourses, Wong said the two territories are discussing an investment promotion and protection deal and a number of organisations have signed memoranda of understanding on issues ranging from dispute avoidance and resolution to artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pointed out that the SAR provides a fundraising platform for Saudi Arabian businesses to expand, serves as a springboard to access the mainland Chinese market, and offers opportunities to allocate offshore renminbi assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong stressed that the SAR and Saudi Arabia can help each other achieve their "ambitious goals in finance and well beyond".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Saudi Arabia has clear and ambitious goals for the development of its financial markets, and it's cultivating a diversified and efficient financial sector that contributes to realising the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong, meanwhile, is an international financial centre, with a highly open and internationalised market and a regulatory regime that is aligned with major overseas markets. We adopt the best practices in the world... With our advanced capital markets, Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's partner and best friend."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed that the SAR administration is considering setting up an economic and trade office in Saudi Arabia, and that Cathay Pacific will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh in the fourth quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Bonnie Chan, told the same event that the SAR and Saudi Arabia have been working closely together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKEX has been playing its role by building more connectivity between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's capital markets," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have signed a [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Tadawul Group. We have added the Saudi exchange as one of our recognised stock exchanges. We listed the world's largest and Asia's first Saudi ETF on our markets, an important first step in enabling Hong Kong investors to get to know to the Saudi market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Minister of Investment Development in Saudi Arabia, Saleh Al-Khabti, said Hong Kong could be more involved in the kingdom's development, as Riyadh aims to invest US$3.2 trillion into its economy by 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One thing that's very important is I believe we don't see enough participation from the Hong Kong financial sector and the role it can play to facilitate for China and the rest of Asia, becoming part of that beautiful story we have," he said.

 Hong Kong stocks and mainland markets were barely moved at the open on Thursday, with traders looking for inspiration to extend their latest rally following a soft lead from Wall Street.

  The Hang Seng Index inched down eight points to 18,306.

  The Shanghai Composite Index was also flat, ticking a third of a point lower to 3,128, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on the mainland's second exchange slid a quarter of a point to 1,773. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved in opposite directions on Wednesday, digesting another round of mixed earnings in a quarter that has seen solid but unspectacular corporate results.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think that companies did a nice job of outpacing their Q1 expectations. But I did notice that earnings estimates for the year for 2024 really haven't changed much," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that companies aren't reporting "much earnings growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.4 percent at 39,056.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was flat at 5,187, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,302.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks finished little changed on Tuesday after three up days in which markets embraced Federal Reserve comments that further interest rate hikes were unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A handful of prominent earnings reports have commanded focus in a week with few major economic reports following last week's heavy calendar that included April jobs data and a Federal Reserve decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Uber dropped 5.7 percent after reporting a US$654 million loss, while rival ride-hailing company Lyft jumped 7.1 percent after topping estimates, saying it sees solid demand growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also higher was Reddit, which advanced 3.9 percent as it posted a 48 percent jump in revenues to US$243 million. The social media company said higher costs were driven by expenses for its initial public offering. (AFP)

    FTX says customers will be repaid for losses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customers of failed cryptocurrency platform FTX will be made whole on the assets they lost when the company collapsed in 2022, it announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plan "contemplates the centralised distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022," said a statement released by FTX Trading LTD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total distributions to customers will be between US$14.5-US$16.3 billion. FTX said the plan still must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 percent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors," said John Ray III, chief executive and chief restructurings officer of FTX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX said it garnered the funds "by monetising an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets," mostly investments held by the company and affiliates and litigation claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another factor was the resolution of claims against the firm, including some US$24 billion that had been sought by the Internal Revenue Service for the period prior to the Chapter 11 filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To resolve the IRS cases, FTX will instead pay US$200 million in cash and US$685 million to be paid out after other claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan also will pay out interest of up to nine percent, FTX said. What won't be included will be the appreciation in value that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed since November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX collapsed suddenly following a deluge of customer withdrawals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's chief architect, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison following a conviction of fraud and other financial crimes. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Toyota says it enjoyed a record net profit of 4.94 trillion yen in the its financial year ending in March.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Auto-giant Toyota doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March, as strong vehicles sales and a favorable exchange rate lifted results for Japan’s top carmaker.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Toyota on Wednesday said its annual profit totaled 4.9 trillion yen, up from 2.45 trillion yen the year before, while its sales jumped 21 percent to 45 trillion yen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results exceeded Toyota’s own projection for a 4.5 trillion yen profit, as its global sales surged to 9.4 million vehicles from 8.8 million vehicles in the previous fiscal year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales of hybrids performed well, although Toyota stressed it was working hard to offer various kinds of electric vehicles, including battery EVs, plug-ins and fuel cell models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles during this fiscal year, with sales projected to grow in the US and the rest of Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toyota said it will make key investments in areas such as research on technology in coming months to sustain long-term growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It expects its net profit for the fiscal year through to March 2025 to decline nearly 28 percent to 3.57 trillion yen, with spending also covering investments in workers at suppliers and dealers it called “human capital.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auto industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation away from old-style gasoline engines, especially in markets like China, where EVs dominate and some analysts say automakers like Toyota may have fallen behind. (AP)

 Wall Street stocks finished a choppy session essentially flat on Tuesday, a sideways performance that could persist until investors digest significant economic releases later in the month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The market might just be due for some pause, consolidation," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts pointed to light trading volume in a comparatively quiet period of news after last week saw major earnings reports, economic releases and a Federal Reserve decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upcoming potential catalysts include US consumer price data and Walmart results, both of which are scheduled for next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones edged up 0.1 percent to 38,884.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,187, while the Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 16,332.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney dropped 9.5 percent as it reported a small quarterly loss and pointed to a moderation in travel spending expected to weigh on results at its parks division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple advanced 0.4 percent after unveiling new versions of its iPad tablets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spirit AeroSystems, a major contractor to Boeing and Airbus, fell 0.3 percent as it reported a US$616.7 million quarterly loss, reflecting a drag from lower output amid Boeing's quality control problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has also so far not reached a pricing agreement with Airbus, further weighing on financial performance. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee says further integration and development with mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive, John Lee, on Tuesday called on the financial sector to enhance cooperation with the mainland, after the nation’s securities regulator introduced measures to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last month unveiled five measures to promote coordinated development between the capital markets of the mainland and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These measures included relaxing eligibility criteria for exchange-traded fund products in the Stock Connect mechanism, as well as the inclusion of real estate investment trusts for the first time. The CSRC also said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech to over 200 business leaders prior to a closed-door discussion on enhancing collaboration between the financial markets in Hong Kong and the mainland, Lee said cross-border cooperation will bring in more business opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further integration and development with the mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages and enhance the competitiveness of the mainland financial market, attracting more capital and businesses. This will drive economic development and will allow people to share in the fruits of progress," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting with business leaders, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the SAR government is still in negotiations with mainland authorities on the implementation of the CSRC's measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that these measures would allow international investors to use Hong Kong as a gateway to access mainland equity markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is the national springboard for mainland capital and investors seeking overseas opportunities, and thereby provides a very convenient and very familiar platform for overseas investors to go through Hong Kong to participate in the mainland equity market," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission’s CEO Julia Leung, meanwhile, told reporters that the measures are expected to be implemented as early as the third quarter.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks advanced on Monday, extending a rally on hopes for possible Federal Reserve interest rate cuts soon after weaker US jobs data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US stocks were in positive territory the whole session as analysts pointed to Friday's jobs report showing weaker than expected employment growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A note from Charles Schwab characterised the report as "perfect" in terms of being in "not too hot and not too cold territory," while adding that "it's just one set of numbers and there's a risk that the market may overreact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 38,852 up 0.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.0 percent to 5,180, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.2 percent to 16,349.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices have risen the last three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Paramount Global gained 3.1 percent following a New York Times report that it entered into talks with a bidding group led by Sony Pictures and Apollo after negotiations between Paramount and Skydance didn't produce a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyson Foods slid 5.7 percent as it reported slightly lower revenues and projected flat sales in the upcoming quarter. Executives said inflation was pinching low-income consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spirit Airlines sank 10 percent after reporting a US$142.6 million quarterly loss. The carrier pointed to a "challenging" competitive environment due to "elevated capacity" in key markets. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Eddie Yue, on Monday urged banks to be prepared to operate during severe weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yue told reporters that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) is making progress towards ensuring local stock and derivatives markets can still function during adverse weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong Exchanges is now finalising the arrangement and we have asked the banks to make sure that they get prepared, so that whatever the final arrangement is they will be able to support it and we have asked them to make early preparations for example on if there should be any system change,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue's remarks follow the completion of a public consultation exercise by HKEX in January on ending stock market closures during severe weather events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Yue said the HKMA will host the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit from November 18 to 20, adding that around 50 to 60 people have confirmed their attendance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA chief said he hopes the summit will attract prominent business figures to Hong Kong and will strengthen the city’s position as an international financial hub.

    Exchange Fund posts HK$54.3bn first quarter gain

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said its Exchange Fund posted an investment gain of HK$54.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, despite the underwhelming performance of local stock markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the second consecutive quarter of gains for the fund, whose primary role is to back the Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a panel meeting in the Legislative Council, the HKMA revealed that the fund lost HK$2.3 billion in local equities in the first quarter and lost HK$4.8 billion on its foreign exchange assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, these were offset by gains of HK$25.1 billion from bond investments and HK$36.3 billion from other stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the future performance of the fund remains uncertain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The uncertainty about the US interest rate path, which will depend on the path of inflation in the US... we will still need to see the incoming economic data and see where the inflation path in the US will go, and see whether they will, as the market is expecting now, defer the rate cut decision and also the pace may be a little slower than expected before,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue also said tensions in the Middle East and the pace of economic recovery in mainland China contribute additional uncertainty to the performance of the Exchange Fund.

    Tax hike by US government 'likely': Buffett

<div class="itemFullText">
 Warren Buffett said he expects the US government to increase taxes to tackle widening fiscal deficits rather than reduce spending.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think higher taxes are likely," he said on Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They may decide that some day they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large because that has some important consequences. So they may not want to decrease spending and they may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we own, and we’ll pay it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated in its latest long-term budget projections federal deficits will rise to 8.5 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal 2054 from 5.5 percent in fiscal 2024. US budget deficits are expected to deteriorate if tax cuts introduced in 2017 are renewed next year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street surged to a higher close on Friday as a softer-than-expected employment report bolstered the case for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve while also providing evidence of US economic resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major US stock posted robust gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the pack, rising 2 percent with an assist from Apple shares following the iPhone maker's record share buyback announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indexes notched their second straight Friday-to-Friday gains, capping a week in which markets were encouraged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's more dovish-than-expected statements following Wednesday's rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's employment report showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected, while the unemployment rate ticked higher and wage growth unexpectedly cooled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report likely hit the sweet spot for the Fed, offering signs the labor market is softening, which Powell has deemed necessary to put inflation on a sustainable downward path. The report also provided assurances on US economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report prompted investors to raise bets the Fed would implement its first rate reduction in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investor narrative remains the Fed and interest rates and today’s weak jobs report puts rate cuts firmly on the Fed’s 2024 agenda," said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments in New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials weighed in on the data. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her willingness to hike rates if inflation progress reverses, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the employment report boosted confidence the economy is not overheating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple surged 6.0 percent, after the company unveiled a record US$110 billion share buyback program and beat quarterly expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Travel platform Expedia cut its full-year revenue growth forecast, sending its shares sliding 15.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18 percent, to 38,676, the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent, to 5,128 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.99 percent, to 16,156. (Reuters)

    US job growth slows, boosting rate cut hopes

<div class="itemFullText">
 US job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0 percent for the first time in nearly three years, but it is probably too early to expect that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates before September as the labour market remains fairly tight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate rising to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent in March amid increasing labour supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless, the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for the 27th straight month. Data this week showed job openings declining in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the US central bank could after all engineer a "soft-landing" for the economy and doused chatter of stagflation, which had been fanned by news of a sharp moderation in economic growth and a surge in inflation in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Financial markets boosted the odds of a September rate cut and saw the Fed reducing borrowing costs twice this year instead of only once before the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A cooler pace of hiring to a more sustainable pace should be interpreted as beneficial with respect to the inflation outlook going forward and remove any lingering concerns of a wage price spiral and put to bed loose and undisciplined talk from the corners of the trading community about stagflation," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000 jobs last month, the fewest in six months, the Labour Department's Bureau of Labour Statistics said. Revisions showed 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than previously reported.  (Reuters)

    HSBC not planning more asset sales: chairman

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC says it will keep offering strong returns to shareholders. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751701_1_20240503232729.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC has no current plans to sell more assets, its chairman Mark Tucker said on Friday at the annual shareholder meeting of the bank, which has scaled back its presence in Western markets in recent years as part of a sweeping overhaul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  HSBC shareholders met in London days after the bank's CEO Noel Quinn announced his surprise retirement following a five-year tenure which saw HSBC sell retail banking operations in France and the US, and its entire Canadian unit, as it pivots towards Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman's comments hint at a likely shift in direction for whomever succeeds Quinn, as the bank turns its focus away from shrinking its global empire to trying to grow its business in its remaining markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shareholders, as expected, backed a resolution to lift a cap on the size of bonuses HSBC can pay its top UK bankers, after Britain axed a policy limiting payouts that it had inherited from the European Union. Goldman Sachs is removing the cap and other banks are expected to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to shareholders at the meeting, Tucker also said HSBC was in a strong position to continue paying robust dividends despite an uncertain global economic outlook and central bank policy moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank, which returned US$19 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share buybacks, has announced a further US$8.8 billion so far for 2024, and is targeting a dividend payout ratio of 50 percent this year, Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has been able to splash out on such shareholder rewards in recent years as rising central bank interest rates have boosted its lending income, turbo-charging its profits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation remains key to the global interest rate outlook, Tucker said. HSBC economists forecast that global inflation will fall gradually to 5.8 percent in 2024 and 3.8 percent in 2025, having climbed as high as 6.3 percent in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank expects the European Central Bank and Bank of England to cut rates in June, both lowering by 150 basis points by the end of 2025, and expects the US Federal Reserve to cut in September, cutting by 100 basis points by the same time. (Reuters)

    HK retail sales fall 7 percent in March

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751663_1_20240503175013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales fell 7 percent in March from a year earlier, ending 15 months of growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to figures released by the Census And Statistics Department on Friday, sales totalled HK$31.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decline followed a 1.9 percent increase in February, and 0.9 percent growth in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, retail sales for the first quarter of 2024 fell by 1.3 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government blamed the drop on the high base of comparison for visitor spending and the timing of the Easter holidays last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It predicted that the retail sector will benefit from a continued tourism revival and rising household income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further revival of inbound tourism and rising household income should remain supportive to the retail sector. The government's efforts to promote a mega event economy and boost sentiment should also help. Yet, the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents may continue to pose challenges," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Annie Tse, said the sales drop was a result of more Hongkongers heading to the mainland in their free time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The northbound travel and consumption will continue since transportation is too convenient nowadays, and it is the trend. I would not say it's something that we want, but it's quite normal. We, as retailers, have to face the situation, and that will definitely be a continuing effect that will affect our industry," she said.

    Apple beats Q1 expectations, announces share buyback

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Apple has announced its biggest ever share buyback. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751578_1_20240503051021.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday reported a smaller than expected decline in quarterly revenue, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company expects a return to sales growth in the current quarter as it invests in AI features to be unveiled in the coming months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apple increased its cash dividend by 4 percent and authorised an additional programme to buy back US$110 billion of its stock. The buyback is the largest in the company's history, according to Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Apple surged roughly 7 percent in extended trade after the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple said fiscal second-quarter revenue fell 4 percent to US$90.8 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of US$90.01 billion, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Apple's current quarter, which ends in June, Cook said the iPhone maker expects "to grow low-single digits" in overall revenue. Wall Street expects 1.33 percent revenue growth to US$82.89 billion, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple faces a raft of challenges across its business. Smartphone rivals such as Samsung Electronics have introduced competing devices aimed at hosting artificial-intelligence chatbots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the regulatory front, Apple's services business, which contains its lucrative App Store and was one of the few areas of growth in the fiscal second quarter, is under pressure from a new law in Europe. In the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market and driving up prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the fiscal second quarter, IPhone sales fell 10.5 percent to US$45.96 billion, compared with analyst expectations of US$46 billion. Apple executives said in February that the year-ago fiscal second quarter had benefited from a US$5 billion surge in iPhone sales as the company caught up from supply-chain snarls during pandemic lockdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling 10 percent this year. (Reuters)

    Dovish Fed talk helps Wall Street rally

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Thursday as investors weighed the Federal Reserve's more dovish-than-expected interest rate guidance on Wednesday against a plethora of mixed earnings and economic data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three indexes ended in positive territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way, advancing 1.5 percent with a healthy boost from chip stocks after Qualcomm reported quarterly sales and profit above analysts' expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets continued to parse Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assurances on Wednesday that the central bank's next policy move will be to lower its key policy rate, after it left rates unchanged at the end of its monthly meeting. However, he noted that recent strong inflation readings have suggested that first of these rate cuts could be a long time in coming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The takeaway from yesterday is that the Fed's bias is still a downward, hold steady or cut rates," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist at Murphy & Silvest in Elmhurst, Illinois.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They're not willing to raise rates from here. They'll keep rates steady, and any sign of economic weakness or lower inflation, they are going to be ready to jump on it and cut."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Data released on Thursday included muted jobless claims, a drop in planned layoffs, a surge in quarterly labour costs and a sharp deceleration in productivity, all of which throws focus on Friday's closely watched April employment report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed has been consistent in saying they're going to be data dependent," said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. "We went into this year thinking there could be more cuts, earlier. "The data hasn't supported that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, Qualcomm advanced 9.8 percent following its earnings beat. Shares of used car platform Carvana surged 33.8 percent on its upbeat profit forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But disappointing profit guidance sent DoorDash's stock down 10.3 percent. Etsy shares slid 15.0 percent after the online marketplace missed Wall Street expectations for first-quarter gross merchandise sales and profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peloton dropped 2.5 percent after the fitness equipment maker's CEO stepped down and the company announced a 15 percent cut to its global workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.85 percent, to 38,226. The S&P 500 gained 0.91 percent, at 5,064 and the Nasdaq Composite added  1.51 percent, at 15,841. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's securities regulator says it has started an insider dealing prosecution against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751549_1_20240502212148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday said it had started criminal proceedings against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its founder, director and chief investment officer Simon Sadler, and former trader Daniel La Rocca for the offence of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company prior to a block trade in June 2017.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SFC said the two defendants appeared at Eastern Magistrates' Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned to June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, a British businessman, is also the owner of Blackpool Football Club which competes in England's EFL League One division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Established in 2007, Segantii is one of the oldest and biggest hedge funds in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from Hong Kong, it also has operations in London, New York and Dubai, according to its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on its website, Blackpool Football Club said the charges were entirely unrelated to the club, and its day-to-day operations would not be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that Mr Sadler will vigorously defend himself against the charge, and there will be no further comments at the time from the Club," the statement added. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s economy grew at a better-than-expected rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter, partially boosted by the steady rise in exports of goods and services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, that growth was lower compared with the 4.3 percent figure seen in the last quarter of 2023, according to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the city’s finance chief indicated that first quarter growth would be in line with the projected full-year growth range at between 2.5 and 3.5 percent for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Simon Lee, honorary fellow at Chinese University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Business, said the number was better than expected, but noted the momentum might not be sustainable in the coming quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My original estimate [for the first quarter] was about one to two percent growth. But the 2.7 percent growth also came on a relatively low base in the first quarter last year when the borders just opened and economic activities were just reactivated,” Lee told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see that it’s quite remarkable in terms of exports and imports of goods and services [in the first quarter]… but if you look at local consumption… quite a number of local people went elsewhere for spending and this will have a significant effect on the GDP growth.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[Although] exports tend to do well at the end of the year, there are also variable factors, such as the economic situation on the mainland and geopolitical issues, so I am still quite cautious on the full-year growth,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee warned Hong Kong could see growth slow to about one or two percent in the coming quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysing the major economic components, the growth of private consumption, capital formation, as well as the imports of goods and services all slowed during the three-month period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, exports of goods increased by 6.7 percent year on year, significantly higher compared with the 2.8 percent growth seen in the final quarter of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports of services rose by a notable 8.1 percent year on year in the quarter, although the pace was much slower compared with the 21.2 percent growth seen in Q4 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, exports of services should be supported by further revival of inbound tourism alongside the continued recovery of handling capacity and the government's efforts to promote a mega event economy,” a government spokesperson commented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Domestically, rising household income and the government's initiatives to boost sentiment should help private consumption, but the changing consumption pattern of residents may pose challenges. [And] a longer period of tight financial conditions may have some dampening effects on economic confidence and activities,” the spokesperson added.

    HKMA again leaves key interest rate unchanged

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday again kept its key interest rate unchanged at 5.75 percent, saying “high rates may last for some time”.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move by the city’s de facto central bank came in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve which earlier kept its target rate at a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.5 percent, citing “hotter-than-expected” price pressures as well as growth reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, HKMA said the Fed “has not yet gained enough confidence about the US inflation trajectory to start cutting interest rates”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The high interest rate environment may last for some time,” it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said the city’s financial and monetary markets are operating in a smooth and orderly manner, but warned that the interbank offered rate (Hibor) may remain high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC took the lead among the city's banks in leaving its prime lending rate unchanged at 5.875 percent, while keeping interest rates on Hong Kong dollar savings accounts steady.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the one-month Hibor rate, which is used to price the majority of local mortgages, slightly rose to 4.34 percent, a three-week high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-month Hibor rate, which reflects banks’ funding costs, also rose slightly to a three-week high, at 4.58 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA and the Fed have kept their key lending rates unchanged since last July, after increasing them 11 times since March 2022.

 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Wednesday, concluding a volatile session after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates flat and signaled rate hikes were not probable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Major equities had shot higher after Fed Chair Jerome Powell called further rate hikes unlikely, but those gains largely faded in the final moments of the session.

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at 37,903, up 0.2 percent from Tuesday, but down almost 450 points from its session peak.

    Binance chief Zhao jailed for four months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Changpeng Zhao arrives for his sentencing hearing in Seattle. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751333_1_20240501094516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Changpeng Zhao, the former chief executive of Binance, was sentenced on Tuesday to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Once considered the most powerful crypto industry figure, Zhao, known as "CZ," is the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle was significantly shorter than the three years sought by prosecutors, and below the maximum one and a half years recommended under federal guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also much lighter than the 25 years behind bars that Sam Bankman-Fried received in March for stealing US$8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, prosecutors cheered the outcome of what had been a years-long investigation into Binance and Zhao, a billionaire who had been living beyond US reach in the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was an epic day,” US Attorney Tessa Gorman told reporters outside the courthouse. “Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before handing down the sentence, Jones faulted Zhao for making Binance's growth and profitability a higher priority than complying with US laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You had the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to make sure that every single regulation had to be complied with, and so you failed at that opportunity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhao, 47, did not visibly react upon hearing his sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "'Crime pays' is the message sent today," Dennis Kelleher, head of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in an email, noting Zhao will still get to keep his vast wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors said Binance employed a "Wild West" model that welcomed criminals, and did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm sorry," Zhao told the judge before being sentenced. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Tuesday following disappointing economic data as US Treasury yields pushed higher ahead of a Federal Reserve decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since July 2022, missing expectations amid rising anxiety over the jobs market and future financial conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts also cited an uptick in US Treasury yields following data showing a jump in US employee compensation costs in the first quarter. The rise came as the Fed kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting.
  <br/>

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 percent to 37,815.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.

    Asia's first crypto ETFs gain in HK debut

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six spot bitcoin and ether exchange traded funds (ETFs) gained in their Hong Kong debut on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The launch of Asia's first cryptocurrency-based ETFs comes three months after a similar move in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unlike in the US, however, crypto enthusiasts in Hong Kong can also invest by swapping their own tokens, as well as buying with cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera climbed more than 2 percent by midday, while three funds linked to ether were also up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a launch event, the executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission, Christina Choi, said the ETFs mark a milestone for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi warned would-be investors, however, that virtual assets aren't for everyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Virtual assets themselves are highly speculative and their prices are extremely volatile. bitcoin and ether have in the past experienced a 40 percent drop in a single day and over 60 percent drop within a year," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Therefore, I would like to remind everyone that virtual assets are not suitable for all investors. Only those who have a thorough understanding of them and can withstand the risks should consider these products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, Bonnie Chan, said the ETFs will boost the local market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The listing of six virtual asset ETFs today will further enrich Hong Kong's ETF product offerings. It will attract more investors to participate in the Hong Kong ETF market, enhance market liquidity, promote Hong Kong's development as an attractive ETF market in Asia, and strengthen its competitiveness as an international asset management hub," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan told the same event that the listings demonstrate Hong Kong's status as a leading virtual assets market in Asia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn will retire, the bank said on Tuesday, in a surprise departure from the business that he has overhauled in the past five years through a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it has already launched a formal process to find a successor, with Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery likely the leading internal candidate for the job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, HSBC reported a 1.8 percent drop in first-quarter profit as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia and amid inflationary pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pretax profit came in at US$12.7 billion for the quarter ended March versus US$12.9 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were better than the US$12.6 billion average of analysts' forecasts compiled by HSBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-headquartered bank also announced US$3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of US$2 billion in share purchases announced in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking during a media call, Quinn said he informed the group's chairman Mark Tucker of his decision last month, saying he wanted to have a better work-life balance after an "intense" five-year period in the top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would never have dreamed of being the CEO in the bank 37 years ago and it's a privilege. But you also have to look forward and say what's right for you personally, and I did a lot reflecting on that over Christmas, the New Year, and January," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's right for me, but also think it's right for the bank, it's a natural transition point for the bank," adding he would work hard to ensure a smooth transition for his successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tucker thanked Quinn for his leadership and for his years of work at the bank, and said he and the board fully "support and respect that decision". (Reuters)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HSBC group chairman also said the board and its nomination committee hoped to name a new chief executive in the second half of this year.

    China factory activity slows in April

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Official Chinese data showed slower manufacturing growth in April. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751150_1_20240430103806.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in April, an official factory survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting some loss of momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 50.4 in April from 50.8 in March, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and just ahead of a median forecast of 50.3 in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data underlines the challenges facing policymakers even though solid first quarter GDP growth had reduced some of the urgency to ramp up stimulus measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New export orders grew at a much slower rate, while employment continued to shrink, the NBS's PMI data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, a private Caixin factory survey, which was also released on Tuesday, showed manufacturing activity grew more quickly as new export orders rose, providing a more optimistic outlook than the official data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors expect Beijing to launch more stimulus to support the economy and were waiting for the outcome of a politburo meeting, which is expected to focus on economic affairs this month. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Monday, extending a rally from late last week ahead of a Federal Reserve decision and key earnings reports in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A news-jammed week includes Wednesday's Fed decision, where the central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but will update investors on the prospects for cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will also digest April jobs data, as well as surveys measuring manufacturing sector health and consumer confidence.
  <br/>

  "This week has something for everyone," said a note from Charles Schwab.

  <br/>
  The Dow Jones advanced 0.4 percent to 38,386.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 5,116, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 15,983.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple, Coca-Cola and Pfizer are among the large companies reporting quarterly earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies in the S&P 500 have thus reported an average of 3.5 percent higher earnings compared with the year-ago period, according to Factset.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Tesla shot up nearly 15 percent after receiving a key security clearance from the Chinese government for smart cars during a visit to China by Chief Executive Elon Musk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple gained 2.7 percent following an upgrade from equity analysts at Bernstein.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Domino's Pizza jumped 5.6 percent as it reported a 6.1 percent increase in first-quarter sales to US$4.4 billion. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan says first quarter economic growth is expected to fall within the 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent range. Photo courtesy of the secretary's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750893_1_20240428120932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.

    Alphabet, Microsoft power gains on Wall Street

File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750769_1_20240427042348.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 38,239, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent to 5,099, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.0 percent to 15,927.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its US$70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above US$2 trillion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft shares rose after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services. On Wednesday, Meta results had disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins," said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing," Plumb added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692 percent  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Snap surged after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest shares also finished higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exxon Mobil lost ground after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel dropped after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data centre and PC chips. (Reuters)

    Inflation indicator may delay expected US rate cut

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest personal consumption expenditures price index may push back an expected interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750764_1_20240427022105.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank's favoured measure of inflation accelerated last month, according to government data published on Friday, pushing back the chances of an interest rate cut this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hotter print is likely to cement the view that inflation, while down sharply since 2022, remains a challenge, and could keep the Federal Reserve on pause as it seeks to battle rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also complicates US president Joe Biden's re-election message as he seeks to convince sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in March, up 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was above the median forecast of 2.6 percent in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the overall annual rise came from the services sector, which increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the more volatile items, energy prices rose by 2.6 percent from a year ago, while food prices were up 1.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While inflation has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak, today's report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down," White House national economic advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, PCE inflation rose by 0.3 percent, in line with the figure from February, the Commerce Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closely watched "core" measure of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in March, unchanged from a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The March figures reaffirm the concern among economists that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than previously thought -- complicating the Federal Reserve's fight to bring it down firmly to its long-term target of two percent through interest rate hikes. (AFP)

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices rebounded in March, rising one percent month-on-month and ending a 10-month falling streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department showed that the official private flat price index edged up to 305.7, from 302.5 in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, prices were still more than 13 percent lower on a yearly basis and 23 percent lower than the all-time high recorded in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents also edged up in March, rising 0.5 percent on a monthly basis, or 5.6 percent on an annual basis, following a two-month falling streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases came after the government lifted all remaining property cooling measures in the budget in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The city’s property market has seen a revenge-style rebound after the lifting of the cooling measures, as the buyers’ sentiment noticeably improved,” said Martin Wong, director and head of research & consultancy, Greater China, at Knight Frank Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “However, prices of lived-in homes may continue to weaken due to the impact of sales of new homes. And as the interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve may also come later than the markets anticipated, meaning the city may start cutting rates from late third quarter, the high rates may continue weighing on the market.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong, struck a cautious note on the property price outlook due to surging supplies and an uncertain path for interest rate cuts, saying she expects a five to 10 percent fall over the year.

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750596_1_20240426050729.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected US economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Thursday showed that the US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11 percent, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8 percent in extended hours trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 percent, to 38,086, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 percent, to 5,048 and the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 15,612.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labour market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Business Machines fell 8 percent after it announced a US$6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southwest Airlines slid nearly 7 percent as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time. Caterpillar shed 7 percent after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.

    New tools needed to reduce FX risks: ABAC

<img alt="ABAC representatives conclude the council's meeting in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750512_2_20240425164048.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.

 The benchmark S&P 500 closed higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, as investors weighed an uptick in Treasury yields amid positive corporate results particularly from technology giants.

  An auction of a record US$70 billion worth of five-year US Treasury notes on Wednesday helped to push bond yields higher and had weighed on equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose five basis points to 4.6459 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow finished lower while the Nasdaq ended higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also focused on quarterly earnings from companies, especially from megacap growth stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms fell 11 percent in extended hours trading after the tech giant reported that its capital expenditure could reach up to US$40 billion in 2024, even as its first quarter revenue beat estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their results later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 12 percent after the electric vehicle maker's plans to boost production and roll out more affordable models overshadowed its weak quarterly results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My biggest concern is the bond market, particularly the long end of the US yield curve," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.02 percent to 5,072 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.10 percent, to 15,713. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, to 38,461.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are eyeing first quarter gross domestic product data on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March on Friday. Hotter-than-expected consumer price inflation report for March had pushed back expectations of when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Laura Cha says Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will continue to develop its global connectivity, as she steps down from her role as chairwoman.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.
