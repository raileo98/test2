<div class="itemFullText">
 Existing home sales in the United States crept lower in April as mortgage rates remained elevated, industry data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales of previously owned homes dipped by 1.9 percent from March, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million, said the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected a slight uptick last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Home sales changed little overall, but the upper-end market is experiencing a sizeable gain due to more supply coming onto the market," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total housing inventory at the end of April was up nine percent from March, and was 16.3 percent higher than the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage rates have surged in recent years as the Federal Reserve rapidly hiked the benchmark lending rate to tackle stubborn inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, the central bank continues to hold rates steady as it seeks to stamp out price increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of May 16, the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02 percent, up from 6.39 percent a year prior, according to home loan finance firm Freddie Mac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-May 2021, the rate was around three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher rates have weighed on transactions, as homeowners who locked in lower rates previously remained reluctant to enter the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, home sales were also 1.9 percent lower in April, NAR data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median sales price in April rose 5.7 percent from a year ago to US$407,600 – the highest since June 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, however, "the pace of price increases should taper off since more housing inventory is becoming available," Yun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage demand is expected to remain tepid in the near term, given that long-term rates are still elevated, analysts from Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a recent note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect a decline in long-term rates over the next couple of months, but we also expect the labour market will start to look much weaker, slowing the growth in the pool of potential homebuyers," Pantheon added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The tech-rich Nasdaq finished at 16,832, up 0.2 percent for the day and a record for the second straight session.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq climbed to a fresh record on Tuesday following a choppy session after a smattering of mixed earnings and muted Federal Reserve commentary.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There really isn't much economic news to speak of," said Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin, who pointed to Wednesday's earnings report from Nvidia as one of the highlights of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Nvidia rose 0.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed governor Christopher Waller welcomed last week's consumer price index report that showed moderating inflation, while adding that "several" months of additional data were needed before interest rates should be cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq finished at 16,832, up 0.2 percent for the day and a record for the second straight session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones also advanced 0.2 percent to 19,872, along with the S&P 500, which stood at 5,321.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cresset's Ablin said the stock market is probably "overbought" at this point, adding that, "relative to bonds, the stock market is probably the most expensive it's been since the financial crisis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices scored records last week following data showing a moderation in inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Lowe's dropped 1.9 percent after earnings topped analyst expectations. However, revenues for the home-improvement retailer fell about four percent to US$21.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump Media & Technology Group slumped 8.7 percent after reporting a net loss of US$327.6 million in the quarter ending March 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disney nudged up 0.1 percent following news the company's animation studio Pixar is laying off about 14 percent of its staff. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gains by several large tech companies pushed the Nasdaq to a fresh record on Monday, on an overall mixed day for US equities as weakness at JPMorgan Chase dragged down the Dow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Microsoft climbed 1.2 percent as it unveiled new PC offerings that feature generative artificial intelligence tools built directly into its Windows operating system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip giant Nvidia also advanced ahead of its earnings release due later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But JPMorgan slumped 4.5 percent, with analysts attributing the decline to CEO Jamie Dimon signalling he is closer to retiring from the US banking giant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq rose 0.7 percent to 16,794, topping last week's record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones, meanwhile, slid 0.5 percent to 39,806, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,308.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Nvidia earnings, this week's calendar includes Federal Reserve minutes from the May 1 meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a mixed session," said Peter Cardillo, of Spartan Capital. "I kind of think it's going to be this way until some new catalyst."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Results from some leading retailers, including Target and Lowe's, are also on this week's plate. Strong results from Walmart last week added to market momentum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other equities, tech company Jabil shot up 5.2 percent after announcing that Michael Dastoor was promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive officer. The company also confirmed its profit forecast. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.

 The Dow Jones finished above 40,000 points for the first time on Friday, as stocks were mixed on Wall Street at the end of the trading week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to finish at 40,003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 percent at 5,303, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 16,685.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the slight decline in the Nasdaq, all three major indexes still finished the week higher than they were at the start of it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We made a breakout to new record high," said Karl Haeling from LBBW.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The market is just choosing to consolidate, which is probably a healthy thing," he continued. "Because it's racing and getting too exuberant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, petrochemical producer Valero Energy finished the day up 4.8 percent, while the mining company Freeport McMoRan was up 4.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the day's big losers was Paramount Global, which saw its share price fall 4.9 percent. (AFP)

    E-CNY pilot scheme expanded to HK for the first time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)

    HK court delays Country Garden hearing till June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition seeking liquidation of Country Garden. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753541_1_20240517125904.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reddit has partnered with OpenAI to bring its content to popular chatbot ChatGPT, the companies said on Thursday, sending the social media platform's shares up 12 percent in extended trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deal underscores Reddit's attempt to diversify beyond its advertising business, and follows its recent partnership with Alphabet to make its content available for training Google's AI models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ChatGPT and other OpenAI products will use Reddit's application programming interface, the means by which Reddit distributes its content, following the new partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OpenAI will also become a Reddit advertising partner, the company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Reddit's March IPO, Reuters reported that Reddit struck its deal with Alphabet, worth about US$60 million per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors view selling its data to train AI models as a key source of revenue beyond Reddit's advertising business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The social media company earlier this month reported strong revenue growth and improving profitability in the first earnings since its market debut, indicating that its Google deal and its push to grow its ads business were paying off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reddit's shares rose 10.5 percent to US$62.31 after the bell. As of Wednesday's close, the stock is up nearly 12 percent since its market debut in March. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished modestly lower on Thursday, retreating from a record run that included the Dow's first ever rise above 40,000 points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow lingered above that level for hours before ending slightly lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had a big move yesterday in response to data that were friendly for the Fed," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today there was this absence of any major catalyst," he said. "With stocks at all-time highs, I think taking a breather is healthy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.1 percent at 39,869.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 5,297, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.3 percent to 16,698.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indices finished at records on Wednesday following data showing a cooling in US inflation that raised hopes of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Walmart shot up 7.0 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits as the retail giant pointed to gains from wealthier consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Deere & Company dropped 4.7 percent as it projected broad-based 2024 sales declines in light of a tough operating environment in the farming economy. (AFP)

 Hong Kong stocks rallied more than one percent on Thursday as investors returned from a midweek break to news that US inflation had started to slow again, boosting hopes for an interest rate cut.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday after data showed a moderation in US consumer prices in April, boosting the chances for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major indices rocketed to fresh all-time highs after monthly US consumer prices came in slightly below expectations, with annual inflation at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage points from March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones gained 0.9 percent to 39,908, putting it back within striking distance of a first-ever close above 40,000 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 jumped 1.2 percent to 5,308, while the Nasdaq advanced 1.4 percent to 16,742, notching a second straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were flat in April, missing estimates for a 0.4 percent increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reports together "point to a cooling of inflation and economic growth, as well as an increase in the likelihood that the Fed will begin its rate-cutting cycle later this year," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US stocks rallied in the first quarter on expectations for interest rate cuts, but hit obstacles later in the spring as Fed officials pushed back the timeframe for easing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Dell surged 11.2 percent after Morgan Stanley analysts lifted their price target on the technology company, highlighting its artificial intelligence offerings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing slumped 2.1 percent after the Department of Justice said the company had breached a 2021 criminal settlement, potentially leading to criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop and AMC Entertainment tumbled following two days of gains that prompted talk of a revived "meme stock" craze. GameStop dropped 18.9 percent, while AMC lost 20 percent. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US consumer inflation eased slightly last month, according to US government data published on Wednesday, a positive sign for President Joe Biden ahead of November's election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The data supports the Biden administration's messaging that the US economy has turned a corner, as it looks to quell consumers' concerns about the impact of rising prices going into the likely rematch against former president Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.4 percent in April, down 0.1 percentage point from March, the US Labour Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was in line with the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly inflation came in at 0.3 percent, slightly below expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CPI data also helps the US Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates to their highest level for 23 years in a bid to bring inflation back down firmly to its long-term target of two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It marks the first month of slowing annual data since January, although both the annual and monthly figures remain too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline," the Labour Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Combined, these two indexes contributed over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A widely-watched inflation measure excluding volatile food and energy prices also eased last month, rising at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, down from 3.8 percent in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The so-called "core" inflation index rose 0.3 percent in April from a month earlier, according to the Labour Department, also slightly lower than in March. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq finished at a new record on Tuesday as US stocks rallied, shrugging off data that showed April wholesale inflation that topped expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech-focused index closed at 16,511, up 0.8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to 39,558, while the S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 5,246.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US wholesale prices jumped by 0.5 percent in April, much above estimates in a dynamic that could keep Federal Reserve interest rates higher for longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, analysts noted that the gain was offset by a revision to the March report, which showed wholesale inflation cooling in that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The numbers were more or less in line," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, who pointed to Wednesday's consumer price report as a key test for stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the first quarter as "notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," adding that "we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Google parent Alphabet rose 0.6 percent as the tech giant highlighted its artificial intelligence offerings at a developer conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home Depot dipped 0.1 percent after reporting a decline in first-quarter revenues as it pointed to "continued softness" in some consumer segments. The home-improvement retailer confirmed its full-year forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GameStop jumped 60.1 percent and AMC Entertainment 32 percent in a revival of the so-called "meme stock" craze from 2021. (AFP)

    US Fed chair says not so confident inflation will ease

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that hot US inflation data has lowered his level of confidence that price rises will slow back down towards the bank's long-term target.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The first quarter in the United States was notable for its lack of further progress on inflation," the head of the US central bank said during an event in the Netherlands that was streamed online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected," he continued. "And so what that has told us is we'll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed has held interest rates at a 23-year high as it looks to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After making progress for much of last year, the rate at which consumer prices have been rising has accelerated since the start of 2024, pushing back expectations of interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell said that, while he still expected inflation to move back down towards the levels seen last year, "my confidence in that is not as high as it was having seen these readings in these first three months of the year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the recent uptick in inflation, Powell said he did not think it was necessary to raise rates from their current "restrictive" levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it's likely, based on the data that we have, that the next move that we make would be a rate hike," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's more likely that we'll be at a place where we hold the policy rate where it is," he added. (AFP)

    US raises tariffs on Chinese imports

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A revival in GameStop and other meme stocks overshadowed a mixed performance in the broader stock market on Monday as a Dow winning streak ended.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Art Hogan, from B. Riley Financial, said the markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's consumer price index report for April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market will celebrate signs of moderating inflation, Hogan said, while further signs of intensifying inflation will lead to "the kind of selling pressure that we saw in April."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 percent to 39,431, ending an eight-day winning streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was flat at 5,221, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 percent to 16,388.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's light schedule in terms of economic reports continued the sleepy tenor of last week, when stocks climbed on hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inflation report -- along with this week's retail sales data -- will inform expectations about US monetary policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, GameStop rocketed 70.9 percent higher while AMC Entertainment surged 80.9 percent. Both benefited from the return to social media of "Roaring Kitty," whose posts helped ignite a massive rally in a handful of stocks in January 2021.
  <br/>

  Apple jumped 1.8 percent following a Bloomberg report that the smartphone giant is close to a deal with OpenAI to add ChatGPT to iPhones. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian mining giant BHP announced on Monday that British rival Anglo American has rejected an "improved" takeover bid worth £34 billion (almost HK$333.5 billion).
 <br>
  <br/>
  BHP's latest offer, which aims to create the world's biggest-listed copper producer, comes after its initial £31.1-billion approach had already been rebuffed last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The revised proposal was rejected by the Anglo American board on 13 May 2024. BHP is disappointed that the... board has chosen not to engage with BHP with respect to the revised proposal and the improved terms," the company said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new bid was pitched at £27.53 per share, up from £25.08 per share that had been slammed by Anglo as "highly unattractive" and "opportunistic" in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BHP has lifted the number of shares that would be given to Anglo investors under the improved terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it still plans to split off Anglo's platinum and iron ore subsidiaries in South Africa, with shares split between the British firm's shareholders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP put forward a revised proposal to the Anglo American Board that we strongly believe would be a win-win for BHP and Anglo American shareholders," said BHP chief executive Mike Henry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are disappointed that this second proposal has been rejected," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest offer would increase Anglo's share of the new combined group to 16.6 percent, up from 14.8 percent previously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "BHP and Anglo American are a strategic fit and the combination is a unique and compelling opportunity to unlock significant synergies by bringing together two highly complementary, world class businesses," added Henry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The combined business would have a leading portfolio of high-quality assets in copper, potash, iron ore and metallurgical coal and BHP would bring its track record of operational excellence to maximise returns from these high-quality assets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-afternoon deals on the London stock market, Anglo American's share price slid 0.8 percent to £27.51, while BHP dipped 0.6 percent to £22.83. (AFP)

    Retail workers at Apple store okay strike action

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Employees at an Apple store in the United States have given the go-ahead for the first strike action against the retailer in the United States. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752877_1_20240513010852.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionized workers at a Maryland Apple store voted on Saturday to authorize a strike, which would mark the first such labour action against the retailer in the United States if it goes forward.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Employees at the Apple store in the town of Towson, near Baltimore, voted to unionise in 2022 -- another first for the iPhone maker's US stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a contract has yet to be agreed upon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following over a year of negotiations with Apple management that yielded unsatisfactory outcomes," union members are "signaling their collective demand for meaningful change," a union statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The issues at the forefront of this action include concerns over work-life balance, unpredictable scheduling practices disrupting personal lives, and wages failing to align with the area's cost of living."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Towson store has about 100 employees. A majority of them were required to vote for the result to be valid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next negotiation meeting is scheduled for May 21, though a strike could come before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, employees at another of the California-based company's stores, in New Jersey, voted down a unionisation effort over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement to CNN, Apple said it would "engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Labor Relations Board, the federal labour regulator, has received numerous complaints against Apple, accusing it of trying to discourage staff from unionising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US tech companies in general are seen as hostile toward unionisation efforts -- particularly Amazon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In September, nearly a quarter of Apple store employees in France went on strike the day the iPhone 15 launched, demanding a pay raise at least equal to inflation. (AFP)

    Wall Street makes gains ahead of inflation data

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street closed higher for the week after a slow Friday. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752698_1_20240511044929.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks eked out modest gains on Friday and all three indexes posted another weekly advance as investors parsed comments from Federal Reserve officials and looked ahead to crucial inflation figures next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 and the Dow were modestly higher and the Nasdaq ended essentially unchanged. All three indexes were up for the week with the blue-chip Dow nabbing its largest Friday-to-Friday percentage advance since mid-December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commentary from several Fed officials helped set expectations as market participants looked toward next week's inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nobody really wants to take a big position prior to next week," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. "And we’re getting into a time of year where people seem to slip out early on Fridays."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The biggest story is the decline in Consumer Sentiment, but outside of that there isn't much to hang your hat on," Carlson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic acknowledged recent clues the economy is slowing, but added the timing of rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Striking a more hawkish tone, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said it was unclear whether monetary policy was tight enough to bring inflation down to the central bank's 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hints of progress toward that target will come next week when the Labour Department releases its Consumer and Producer price indexes (CPI and PPI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect the crucial CPI report to show underlying "core" price of 3.6 percent year-on-year, which would be the coolest reading in over three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Fed is geared not to raise rates but cut them, so 'higher for longer' is about as dire as it's going to unless things really fall off the table," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor & market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest in Elmhurst, Illinois.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent, to 39,513, the S&P 500 gained 0.16 percent, to 5,223 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.03 percent, to 16,341.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia gained 1.3 percent after TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker and a major supplier to Nvidia, reported a near 60 percent jump in April sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Novavax shares surged 98.7 percent in the wake of the vaccine maker's licensing deal worth up to US$1.2 billion with Sanofi. SoundHound AI jumped 7.2 percent after beating first-quarter revenue estimates. (Reuters)

Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752541_1_20240510044645.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks climbed on Thursday as economic data raised hopes that the US central bank is on track for interest rate cuts later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.9 percent to 39,387, while the S&P 500 jumped 0.5 percent to 5,214.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq added 0.3 percent to 16,346.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gains came after initial jobless claims rose to the highest level since last August, to 231,000 for the week ending May 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A higher level of claims – if the trend persists – could be seen as a sign of the labour market cooling down, giving the Federal Reserve impetus to lower interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the higher unemployment claims has helped bond markets. US Treasury bond yields, a proxy for interest rates, moved lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rate cuts will depend on subsequent inflation data, he added: "We are seeing some cracks in the labour market and when that happens, that eventually leads to slow economic activity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among companies reporting results, Warner Bros. Discovery closed 3.1 percent up while Arm Holdings slumped by 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airbnb shares slid by 6.9 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved sideways on Thursday following mixed earnings reports as weekly US jobless claims pushed higher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jump in initial jobless claims by 22,000 to 231,000 puts the benchmark at the highest level since last August, according to Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data "will be construed as a sign of softening in the labour market," O'Hare said. "That view, in turn, will be construed as a possible trigger for a Fed rate cut in coming months."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data came as the Bank of England kept interest rates at a 16-year high but signalled it could cut rates over the summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 25 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones was up 0.1 percent at 39,098.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,186, while the Nasdaq declined 0.3 percent to 16,262.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among companies reporting results, Warner Brothers Discovery advanced 2.0 percent, Arm Holdings dropped 6.3 percent and Airbnb fell 7.2 percent. (AFP)

    Stock market rebound helps more IPO listings: HKEX

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the city's stock exchange operator on Thursday said average daily trading turnover was improving, paving the way for more initial public offerings (IPOs) in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said trading volume towards the end of April had reached up to HK$150 billion, and that turnover during the Golden Week holiday period remained strong at over HK$110 billion when mainland markets were closed with reduced capital flows to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stock market's rebound means that we have regained the confidence of investors. This certainly helps more IPOs to get listed smoothly and successfully in Hong Kong," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the number of IPO applications received by the bourse in the first quarter of this year was 30 percent more than in the same period in 2023, with around 100 currently waiting to be listed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that many firms had expressed interest after the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced new measures to facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the near future, which could boost the city's market, she added.

 China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Figures from the General Administration of Customs show that exports grew 1.5 percent from April last year, in line with analysts' expectations, after contracting sharply to 7.5 percent in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports in April surged 8.4 percent – nearly double market estimates – after falling by 1.9 percent in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports from the United States jumped by nine percent, while exports fell by nearly three percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$72.35 billion from US$58.55 billion in March. (Agencies)

    Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's best friend: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The friendship between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia has blossomed since SAR officials visited the Middle Eastern country two years ago, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Capital Markets Forum, co-organised by the Hong Kong and Saudi bourses, Wong said the two territories are discussing an investment promotion and protection deal and a number of organisations have signed memoranda of understanding on issues ranging from dispute avoidance and resolution to artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pointed out that the SAR provides a fundraising platform for Saudi Arabian businesses to expand, serves as a springboard to access the mainland Chinese market, and offers opportunities to allocate offshore renminbi assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong stressed that the SAR and Saudi Arabia can help each other achieve their "ambitious goals in finance and well beyond".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Saudi Arabia has clear and ambitious goals for the development of its financial markets, and it's cultivating a diversified and efficient financial sector that contributes to realising the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong, meanwhile, is an international financial centre, with a highly open and internationalised market and a regulatory regime that is aligned with major overseas markets. We adopt the best practices in the world... With our advanced capital markets, Hong Kong can be Saudi Arabia's partner and best friend."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed that the SAR administration is considering setting up an economic and trade office in Saudi Arabia, and that Cathay Pacific will resume direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Riyadh in the fourth quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Bonnie Chan, told the same event that the SAR and Saudi Arabia have been working closely together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKEX has been playing its role by building more connectivity between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's capital markets," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have signed a [memorandum of understanding] with Saudi Tadawul Group. We have added the Saudi exchange as one of our recognised stock exchanges. We listed the world's largest and Asia's first Saudi ETF on our markets, an important first step in enabling Hong Kong investors to get to know to the Saudi market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Minister of Investment Development in Saudi Arabia, Saleh Al-Khabti, said Hong Kong could be more involved in the kingdom's development, as Riyadh aims to invest US$3.2 trillion into its economy by 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One thing that's very important is I believe we don't see enough participation from the Hong Kong financial sector and the role it can play to facilitate for China and the rest of Asia, becoming part of that beautiful story we have," he said.

 Hong Kong stocks and mainland markets were barely moved at the open on Thursday, with traders looking for inspiration to extend their latest rally following a soft lead from Wall Street.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks moved in opposite directions on Wednesday, digesting another round of mixed earnings in a quarter that has seen solid but unspectacular corporate results.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think that companies did a nice job of outpacing their Q1 expectations. But I did notice that earnings estimates for the year for 2024 really haven't changed much," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, adding that companies aren't reporting "much earnings growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.4 percent at 39,056.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 was flat at 5,187, while the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent to 16,302.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks finished little changed on Tuesday after three up days in which markets embraced Federal Reserve comments that further interest rate hikes were unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A handful of prominent earnings reports have commanded focus in a week with few major economic reports following last week's heavy calendar that included April jobs data and a Federal Reserve decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Uber dropped 5.7 percent after reporting a US$654 million loss, while rival ride-hailing company Lyft jumped 7.1 percent after topping estimates, saying it sees solid demand growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also higher was Reddit, which advanced 3.9 percent as it posted a 48 percent jump in revenues to US$243 million. The social media company said higher costs were driven by expenses for its initial public offering. (AFP)

    FTX says customers will be repaid for losses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customers of failed cryptocurrency platform FTX will be made whole on the assets they lost when the company collapsed in 2022, it announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plan "contemplates the centralised distribution to customers and other creditors around the world of virtually all of the assets associated with FTX at the time of its collapse in November 2022," said a statement released by FTX Trading LTD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total distributions to customers will be between US$14.5-US$16.3 billion. FTX said the plan still must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100 percent of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors," said John Ray III, chief executive and chief restructurings officer of FTX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX said it garnered the funds "by monetising an extraordinarily diverse collection of assets," mostly investments held by the company and affiliates and litigation claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another factor was the resolution of claims against the firm, including some US$24 billion that had been sought by the Internal Revenue Service for the period prior to the Chapter 11 filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To resolve the IRS cases, FTX will instead pay US$200 million in cash and US$685 million to be paid out after other claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan also will pay out interest of up to nine percent, FTX said. What won't be included will be the appreciation in value that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed since November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTX collapsed suddenly following a deluge of customer withdrawals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's chief architect, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison following a conviction of fraud and other financial crimes. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Toyota says it enjoyed a record net profit of 4.94 trillion yen in the its financial year ending in March.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Auto-giant Toyota doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March, as strong vehicles sales and a favorable exchange rate lifted results for Japan’s top carmaker.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Toyota on Wednesday said its annual profit totaled 4.9 trillion yen, up from 2.45 trillion yen the year before, while its sales jumped 21 percent to 45 trillion yen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results exceeded Toyota’s own projection for a 4.5 trillion yen profit, as its global sales surged to 9.4 million vehicles from 8.8 million vehicles in the previous fiscal year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sales of hybrids performed well, although Toyota stressed it was working hard to offer various kinds of electric vehicles, including battery EVs, plug-ins and fuel cell models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company expects to sell 9.5 million vehicles during this fiscal year, with sales projected to grow in the US and the rest of Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toyota said it will make key investments in areas such as research on technology in coming months to sustain long-term growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It expects its net profit for the fiscal year through to March 2025 to decline nearly 28 percent to 3.57 trillion yen, with spending also covering investments in workers at suppliers and dealers it called “human capital.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Chief Executive Koji Sato told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auto industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation away from old-style gasoline engines, especially in markets like China, where EVs dominate and some analysts say automakers like Toyota may have fallen behind. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished a choppy session essentially flat on Tuesday, a sideways performance that could persist until investors digest significant economic releases later in the month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The market might just be due for some pause, consolidation," said LBBW's Karl Haeling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts pointed to light trading volume in a comparatively quiet period of news after last week saw major earnings reports, economic releases and a Federal Reserve decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upcoming potential catalysts include US consumer price data and Walmart results, both of which are scheduled for next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones edged up 0.1 percent to 38,884.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,187, while the Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent to 16,332.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Disney dropped 9.5 percent as it reported a small quarterly loss and pointed to a moderation in travel spending expected to weigh on results at its parks division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple advanced 0.4 percent after unveiling new versions of its iPad tablets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spirit AeroSystems, a major contractor to Boeing and Airbus, fell 0.3 percent as it reported a US$616.7 million quarterly loss, reflecting a drag from lower output amid Boeing's quality control problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has also so far not reached a pricing agreement with Airbus, further weighing on financial performance. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee says further integration and development with mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752193_1_20240507194419.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive, John Lee, on Tuesday called on the financial sector to enhance cooperation with the mainland, after the nation’s securities regulator introduced measures to maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last month unveiled five measures to promote coordinated development between the capital markets of the mainland and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These measures included relaxing eligibility criteria for exchange-traded fund products in the Stock Connect mechanism, as well as the inclusion of real estate investment trusts for the first time. The CSRC also said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech to over 200 business leaders prior to a closed-door discussion on enhancing collaboration between the financial markets in Hong Kong and the mainland, Lee said cross-border cooperation will bring in more business opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further integration and development with the mainland financial markets will help leverage Hong Kong's international advantages and enhance the competitiveness of the mainland financial market, attracting more capital and businesses. This will drive economic development and will allow people to share in the fruits of progress," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting with business leaders, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the SAR government is still in negotiations with mainland authorities on the implementation of the CSRC's measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that these measures would allow international investors to use Hong Kong as a gateway to access mainland equity markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is the national springboard for mainland capital and investors seeking overseas opportunities, and thereby provides a very convenient and very familiar platform for overseas investors to go through Hong Kong to participate in the mainland equity market," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission’s CEO Julia Leung, meanwhile, told reporters that the measures are expected to be implemented as early as the third quarter.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks advanced on Monday, extending a rally on hopes for possible Federal Reserve interest rate cuts soon after weaker US jobs data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US stocks were in positive territory the whole session as analysts pointed to Friday's jobs report showing weaker than expected employment growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A note from Charles Schwab characterised the report as "perfect" in terms of being in "not too hot and not too cold territory," while adding that "it's just one set of numbers and there's a risk that the market may overreact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 38,852 up 0.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.0 percent to 5,180, while the Nasdaq climbed 1.2 percent to 16,349.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices have risen the last three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Paramount Global gained 3.1 percent following a New York Times report that it entered into talks with a bidding group led by Sony Pictures and Apollo after negotiations between Paramount and Skydance didn't produce a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tyson Foods slid 5.7 percent as it reported slightly lower revenues and projected flat sales in the upcoming quarter. Executives said inflation was pinching low-income consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spirit Airlines sank 10 percent after reporting a US$142.6 million quarterly loss. The carrier pointed to a "challenging" competitive environment due to "elevated capacity" in key markets. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Eddie Yue, on Monday urged banks to be prepared to operate during severe weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yue told reporters that Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) is making progress towards ensuring local stock and derivatives markets can still function during adverse weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong Exchanges is now finalising the arrangement and we have asked the banks to make sure that they get prepared, so that whatever the final arrangement is they will be able to support it and we have asked them to make early preparations for example on if there should be any system change,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue's remarks follow the completion of a public consultation exercise by HKEX in January on ending stock market closures during severe weather events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Yue said the HKMA will host the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit from November 18 to 20, adding that around 50 to 60 people have confirmed their attendance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA chief said he hopes the summit will attract prominent business figures to Hong Kong and will strengthen the city’s position as an international financial hub.

    Exchange Fund posts HK$54.3bn first quarter gain

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said its Exchange Fund posted an investment gain of HK$54.3 billion in the first quarter of this year, despite the underwhelming performance of local stock markets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the second consecutive quarter of gains for the fund, whose primary role is to back the Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a panel meeting in the Legislative Council, the HKMA revealed that the fund lost HK$2.3 billion in local equities in the first quarter and lost HK$4.8 billion on its foreign exchange assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, these were offset by gains of HK$25.1 billion from bond investments and HK$36.3 billion from other stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the future performance of the fund remains uncertain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The uncertainty about the US interest rate path, which will depend on the path of inflation in the US... we will still need to see the incoming economic data and see where the inflation path in the US will go, and see whether they will, as the market is expecting now, defer the rate cut decision and also the pace may be a little slower than expected before,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue also said tensions in the Middle East and the pace of economic recovery in mainland China contribute additional uncertainty to the performance of the Exchange Fund.

    Tax hike by US government 'likely': Buffett

<div class="itemFullText">
 Warren Buffett said he expects the US government to increase taxes to tackle widening fiscal deficits rather than reduce spending.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think higher taxes are likely," he said on Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They may decide that some day they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large because that has some important consequences. So they may not want to decrease spending and they may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we own, and we’ll pay it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated in its latest long-term budget projections federal deficits will rise to 8.5 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal 2054 from 5.5 percent in fiscal 2024. US budget deficits are expected to deteriorate if tax cuts introduced in 2017 are renewed next year. (Reuters)

 Wall Street surged to a higher close on Friday as a softer-than-expected employment report bolstered the case for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve while also providing evidence of US economic resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major US stock posted robust gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the pack, rising 2 percent with an assist from Apple shares following the iPhone maker's record share buyback announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indexes notched their second straight Friday-to-Friday gains, capping a week in which markets were encouraged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's more dovish-than-expected statements following Wednesday's rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's employment report showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected, while the unemployment rate ticked higher and wage growth unexpectedly cooled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report likely hit the sweet spot for the Fed, offering signs the labor market is softening, which Powell has deemed necessary to put inflation on a sustainable downward path. The report also provided assurances on US economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report prompted investors to raise bets the Fed would implement its first rate reduction in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investor narrative remains the Fed and interest rates and today’s weak jobs report puts rate cuts firmly on the Fed’s 2024 agenda," said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments in New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials weighed in on the data. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her willingness to hike rates if inflation progress reverses, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the employment report boosted confidence the economy is not overheating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple surged 6.0 percent, after the company unveiled a record US$110 billion share buyback program and beat quarterly expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Travel platform Expedia cut its full-year revenue growth forecast, sending its shares sliding 15.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18 percent, to 38,676, the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent, to 5,128 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.99 percent, to 16,156. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0 percent for the first time in nearly three years, but it is probably too early to expect that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates before September as the labour market remains fairly tight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate rising to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent in March amid increasing labour supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless, the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for the 27th straight month. Data this week showed job openings declining in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the US central bank could after all engineer a "soft-landing" for the economy and doused chatter of stagflation, which had been fanned by news of a sharp moderation in economic growth and a surge in inflation in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Financial markets boosted the odds of a September rate cut and saw the Fed reducing borrowing costs twice this year instead of only once before the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A cooler pace of hiring to a more sustainable pace should be interpreted as beneficial with respect to the inflation outlook going forward and remove any lingering concerns of a wage price spiral and put to bed loose and undisciplined talk from the corners of the trading community about stagflation," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000 jobs last month, the fewest in six months, the Labour Department's Bureau of Labour Statistics said. Revisions showed 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than previously reported.  (Reuters)
