    London's FTSE strikes record as global sentiment lifts

<div class="itemFullText">
 London's FTSE 100 stocks index hit record highs on Tuesday, catching up with major global peers that have struck all-time peaks this year as inflation cools.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sentiment was upbeat across major world indices thanks to easing Middle East worries and hopes of interest-rate cuts, while traders are keenly awaiting the release this week of more major earnings and key US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London's FTSE 100 reached 8,076 points shortly after the open, surpassing a record 8,047 struck in February last year, though it pared down gains in afternoon deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good news as this is, it does highlight the sluggishness of the UK's top equity index when compared to its US and European competitors which hit a string of successive records throughout the first quarter of 2024," said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he added, "let's not be too churlish as it could be we see the FTSE outperform its rivals in the years to come should investors seek out dividend paying value stocks rather than techy growthy ones."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the dollar, as markets anticipate cuts to UK interest rates in the coming months thanks to slowing price rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A weaker pound benefits FTSE-listed British multinationals that make big earnings in foreign currencies. Sterling gained against the dollar and euro on Tuesday after falling earlier in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets won a lift from news of an improvement to business activity in the eurozone this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street opened higher on a busy week on the corporate front, with investors keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings from Elon Musk's Tesla later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electric car maker, which enjoyed scorching growth for most of 2022 and 2023, has experienced setbacks that analysts say have raised the stakes for the first-quarter report. (AFP)

 HK market opens down after Fed chair's comments

  Hong Kong stocks opened slightly lower on Wednesday after US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell warned the fight against inflation might take more time than expected, fuelling worries interest rates could stay higher for longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index slipped 0.1 percent to 16,225.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shanghai Composite Index was marginally higher, inching up 0.99 points to 3,008, and the Shenzhen Composite Index added 0.5 percent to 1,645. (AFP)

    Tea shop chain brews up HK$2.5bn IPO

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The company behind the ChaPanda tea chain is planning a Hong Kong listing. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748906_1_L_20240415095821.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland tea shop chain Sichuan Baicha Baidao Industrial aims to raise HK$2.5 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), in the city's largest new-share sale of 2024, regulatory filings showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company is selling 147.7 million shares at HK$17.50 each, which represents about 10 percent of its total shares, the filings showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An extra 22.1 million shares could be sold through a so-called greenshoe option. That would see the total number of shares increase to 169.9 million, to raise almost HK$3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shares will start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on April 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Baicha Baidao operates ChaPanda stores which sell a range of fruit tea drinks primarily to younger customers, the company said in its IPO prospectus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong IPO volume is at its lowest level in more than a decade with new-share sales raising US$507 million in the first quarter of this year, down nearly 29 percent from US$710 million from the same time last year, LSEG data showed. (Reuters)

    Firms win approval to launch spot bitcoin, ether ETFs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At least three asset managers say they have given the green light to launch the virtual asset spot ETFs. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749005_1_L_20240415191521.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Monday gave initial approval to its first spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), paving the way for the city to become Asia’s first to treat cryptocurrencies as a mainstream investment tool, according to fund managers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least three offshore Chinese asset managers will launch the virtual asset spot ETFs soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The local units of Harvest Fund Management and Bosera Asset Management said they had received conditional approvals from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the city’s securities watchdog, to launch the ETFs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the local unit of China Asset Management said it had received regulatory approval for the provision of virtual asset management services, and that it's actively deploying the spot bitcoin and ether ETFs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emil Chan, co-chair of the Hong Kong Digital Finance Association, told RTHK that the move will boost the SAR's status as a financial centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There was an exodus earlier that many funds and talent moved from Hong Kong to Singapore because they were unclear about the regulatory status... this time, Hong Kong has moved fast to catch up in a short period of time,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fintech specialist also noted that traditional investors may be attracted to this market as the crypto ETFs allow them to utilise the traditional trading mechanism to access such assets without needing to worry about managing cryptocurrency keys and storage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US launched its first ETFs to track spot bitcoin in January, drawing roughly US$12 billion in net flows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s bourse may take about two weeks to prepare the funds to be offered, meaning the first set of spot ETFs could be available as early as this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The [approval] of the crypto ETFs sent a strong signal to the traditional securities trading markets and players that they have to move forward to look into crypto trading with a different perspective," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the past they considered crypto as unreal, but now it’s being sorted, and if its progress is solid, then it will boost transition and development of the virtual asset industry.” (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Laura Cha says Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will continue to develop its global connectivity, as she steps down from her role as chairwoman. Photo: Online meeting" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750387_1_L_20240424185647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished a volatile week sharply lower, falling on Friday on anxiety over a potential escalation of conflict in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Market watchers cited worries about an imminent attack on Israel by Iran to retaliate for a strike in Damascus – a possibility also raised by President Joe Biden, who urged Iran against the move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending the entire session in the red, the Dow Jones finished down 1.2 percent, or 475 points, at 37,983.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,123, while the Nasdaq shed 1.6 percent to 16,175.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The geopolitical angst came after a hot consumer price report on Wednesday sent stocks tumbling only to be reversed on Thursday in a move seen as a relief rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Equities have been under pressure in recent weeks as traders bet that the Federal Reserve will push back interest rate cuts due to inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JPMorgan Chase on Friday sank 6.5 percent despite strong first-quarter earnings as the large bank highlighted worries over geopolitics and inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The market is probably too happy," CEO Jamie Dimon said on a conference call with reporters. "I think the chance of bad outcomes is higher than other people think."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other large financial companies reporting results, Citigroup fell 1.7 percent, Wells Fargo dipped 0.2 percent and BlackRock dropped 2.9 percent. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The benchmark S&P 500 closed higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, as investors weighed an uptick in Treasury yields amid positive corporate results particularly from technology giants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An auction of a record US$70 billion worth of five-year US Treasury notes on Wednesday helped to push bond yields higher and had weighed on equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose five basis points to 4.6459 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow finished lower while the Nasdaq ended higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also focused on quarterly earnings from companies, especially from megacap growth stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms fell 11 percent in extended hours trading after the tech giant reported that its capital expenditure could reach up to US$40 billion in 2024, even as its first quarter revenue beat estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their results later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 12 percent after the electric vehicle maker's plans to boost production and roll out more affordable models overshadowed its weak quarterly results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My biggest concern is the bond market, particularly the long end of the US yield curve," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong International Airport has been named the world’s busiest cargo airport for 2023 in terms of total volume.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the latest data released by Airports Council International, Chek Lap Kok handled 4.3 million tonnes of cargo last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the 13th time since 2010 that the airport has been named the busiest cargo airport in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Air cargo is a key driver of the growth of Hong Kong’s logistics industry and overall economic development," Airport Authority chairman Jack So said, adding that the authority will work with the air cargo community to further strengthen the airport's competitiveness.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of Japan's high-street fashion giant Uniqlo on Thursday revised up its full-year net profit forecast to what would be a record performance, citing strong global sales.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Retail behemoth Fast Retailing now expects to make 320 billion yen (HK$16.4 billion) in the year to August, up from the previous estimate of 310 billion yen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also sees full-year operating profit of 450 billion yen on sales of 3.03 trillion yen, both of which would also be record figures if realised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Operating profit and sales during the first half to February "represented a new record consolidated performance fuelled primarily by considerably higher first-half profits from Uniqlo operations in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia", the company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its low-cost GU clothing brand has been another key driver of the retail group's expansion, Fast Retailing added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the six months to February, the company posted a 195.9 billion net profit, a 27.7 percent jump year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Operating profit stood at 257.0 billion yen, up 16.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Zara owner Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, said it had enjoyed its highest-ever profits last year despite a complicated global backdrop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, which has seen a strong performance on Spain's stock market over the past year, posted a net profit of 5.4 billion euros (US$5.9 billion), up 30 percent from 4.1 billion euros in 2022, which was also a record. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple and other tech shares led US equities higher on Thursday following mixed inflation data and a European Central Bank decision that signalled a possible imminent interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US wholesale inflation rose by 0.2 percent in March, less than expected. However, on an annual level the index for final demand increased 2.1 percent for the 12 months ending in March -- its highest level since April 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management said the equity gains reflected investor "relief" that the inflation report "wasn't worse than expected" after Wednesday's consumer price report sent stocks tumbling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished flat at 38,459.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 5,199, and the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 1.7 percent to 16,442.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple jumped nearly four percent following a JPMorgan Chase report that pointed to improving investor sentiment on the company, in part due to enthusiasm that iPhones will benefit from upgrades for more AI technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chip companies also had a good day, with Nvidia, Broadcom and Micron all winning more than four percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Central Bank, as expected, held interest rates steady again but said slowing inflation could open the door to easing monetary policy, raising hopes of a first cut in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors are looking ahead to earnings from major banks on Friday. JPMorgan Chase was flat, while Wells Fargo fell 0.4 percent and Citi climbed 0.9 percent. All three report on Friday. (AFP)

    IMF expects steady growth, lower inflation

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The International Monetary Fund says the world economy continues to be resilient. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749203_1_L_20240417023802.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The global economy is set for another year of slow but steady growth, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday, with US strength pushing world output through headwinds from lingering high inflation, weak demand in China and Europe, and spillovers from two regional wars.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The IMF forecast global real GDP growth of 3.2 percent for 2024 and 2025 – the same rate as in 2023. The 2024 forecast was revised upward by 0.1 percentage point from the previous World Economic Outlook's estimate in January, largely due to a significant upward revision in the US outlook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The global economy continues to display remarkable resilience with growth holding steady and inflation declining, but many challenges still lie ahead," Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A potential escalation of the Middle East conflict after Iran's rocket and drone attack on Israel could have a "strong effect" on limiting growth, he said, adding that it would raise oil prices and inflation, triggering tighter monetary policy from central banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US Treasury is preparing to hit Iran with new sanctions in coming days that could limit its ability to export oil, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report described an "adverse scenario" in which a Middle East escalation would lead to a 15 percent increase in oil prices and higher shipping costs would hike global inflation by about 0.7 percentage points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF forecast that global median headline inflation will fall to 2.8 percent by the end of 2024 from 4 percent last year, and to 2.4 percent in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF left unchanged its forecast for China's 2024 growth to fall to 4.6 percent from 5.2 percent in 2023. But it warned that the lack of a comprehensive restructuring package for the country's property sector could prolong a downturn in domestic demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gourinchas said, however, that China's stronger-than-expected first-quarter growth may prompt an upward revision to the outlook. (Reuters)

    'More efforts needed to revive stock market sentiment'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An analyst has said that Hong Kong's stock market performance depends on many factors, including China's economic development. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750024_1_L_20240422200035.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial analysts on Monday said that a pledge by the nation’s securities regulator to offer support in enhancing Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub can provide a short-term boost to market sentiment, but more measures are needed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shares on the Hang Seng Index and Tech Index enjoyed a bump after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Friday said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the measures, the scope of eligible exchange-traded funds (ETFs) via the links will be widened, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) will be included for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James Wong, chief executive of Cathaysia Securities, said the latest move by Beijing had brought a “positive atmosphere” to local stock markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the securities specialist cautioned that such measures may only help in the near future, and that it may take “many more policies” to really improve sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “All of these [measures] are good. But, for example, the number of ETFs that are allowed is less than 10. I really don't know how much capital flow that 10 ETFs can bring to the Hong Kong market,” he noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that there were only 12 initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the first quarter, and described the figure as “scary”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong expressed the hope that authorities will make it easier for mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia, said that Monday's rally came on the back of a combination of factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The sentiment has already improved over the past two months,” said Wen, noting that while the city’s bourse may be able to see more capital inflow following Beijing’s announcement, the “game changer” lies on fundamental factors.

  <br/>
  “It depends on many more factors, including China's economic development and whether the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June or July. These fundamental factors may be more important for foreign or mainland capital - whether they want to come to Hong Kong and buy Hong Kong stocks,” Wen said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation rate slightly rose in March, with the Composite Consumer Price Index up two percent on a year earlier.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compared to the 1.9 percent inflation rate in the previous two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department showed that underlying inflation, stripping out short-term relief measures, was also up marginally in March, at one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcohol and tobacco prices surged nearly 18 percent year-on-year, while meals out and takeaways were up 3.3 percent and housing costs rose 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electricity, gas and water prices dropped 8.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the underlying price inflation was “modest” in March, noting that prices of basic foods edged down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay contained in the near term. Domestic costs may face some upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad downward trend, though heightened geopolitical tensions will bring uncertainties,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first quarter of 2024, overall consumer prices rose 1.9 percent year-on-year.

 Hong Kong stocks fell at the opening on Thursday, tracking a sell-off on Wall Street and across Asia after hotter-than-expected US inflation data dented hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city’s bourse on Thursday announced it is developing a tech platform that would allow it to offer near 24-hour derivatives trading while improving efficiency and introducing new products to address rapidly changing customer needs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), the city’s stock operator, also said that the in-house platform - Orion Derivatives Platform (ODP) - would be launched in 2028, which would help differentiate the group’s derivatives offerings while boosting its global competitiveness in the derivatives market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Building future-ready technology platforms and operations is a key strategic priority for HKEX, as we help our markets and participants deliver long-term, sustainable growth and development,” said the group’s chief executive Bonnie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are therefore pleased to announce plans to develop the ODP, representing our significant investment into the future of our markets,” Chan added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noting that derivatives were one of the faster growing segments of HKEX’s business, with record-breaking volumes in both 2023 and 2022, Chan said such a platform would provide unique advantages - with enhanced trading and clearing capabilities and capital efficient risk management tools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bourse also said it would actively engage with market participants during the development process.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday after US inflation data topped estimates, dampening expectations for imminent interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The much-anticipated data showed US consumer prices in March were up 0.4 percent from February and 3.5 percent from the year prior, both slightly above the expected level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Major indices spent the entire day in the red.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stock market is trying to recalibrate what the world looks like if get two or fewer rate cuts this year," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Financial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.1 percent to 38,461.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 shed 1.0 percent to 5,160, and the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.8 percent to 16,170.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inflation data is heavily scrutinized by the Federal Reserve, which had confirmed plans last month for three interest rate cuts in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Minutes of the meeting released on Wednesday showed that "some" policy makers said recent inflation figures "should not be discounted," while others perceived the increase as the result of "seasonality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But futures markets shifted on Wednesday following the inflation data and now see only a slim chance of a rate cut in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Delta Air Lines fell 2.7 percent despite reporting better than expected earnings and forecasting a record second quarter thanks to continued robust travel demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Wednesday's report Delta shares had risen 18 percent in 2024. (AFP)

    Overall inflation in China slows in March

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, edged up 0.1 percent year on year in March, official data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was below the 0.4 percent gain forecast by a Bloomberg poll of analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, the nation's CPI went down 1 percent in March, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The core CPI, deducting food and energy prices, went up 0.6 percent year on year last month, maintaining a mild increase, according to the NBS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure represented a slower rate of growth from 0.7 percent in February when consumer prices emphatically bucked a deflationary trend stretching back to August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In March, under the impact of factors such as the seasonal decline in consumer demand after the holidays and the overall sufficient market supply, the increase in the nationwide CPI... somewhat declined," the NBS said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slowdown "indicates that China still faces the risk of deflation, as domestic demand remains weak", said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks fell in choppy trading on Wednesday as investors assessed the Federal Reserve's interest rate stance and a batch of soft earnings early in the financial reporting season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Travelers tumbled 7.41 percent and was among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and largest on the Dow Industrials after the insurance giant missed Wall Street expectations for first-quarter profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also weighing on the benchmark S&P index after quarterly results were Prologis, with the warehouse-focused real estate investment trust dropping 7.19 percent, and Abbott Laboratories, which fell 3.03 percent after topping quarterly estimates but disappointing on its annual forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a rally in the last two months of 2023 that extended into the first quarter, equities have struggled with the S&P 500 registering its fourth straight session of declines. The index is on pace for its third straight weekly loss as investors have dialed back expectations for the timing and size of the Fed's rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, US central bank officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell backed away from providing guidance on when rates may be cut, saying instead that monetary policy needs to be restrictive for longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The markets are dealing with a couple things - inflation is hotter than most expect, rate cut expectations are coming down and we've had a ramp higher in geopolitical tensions, particularly out of the Middle East," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's just an excuse for traders to kind of move to the sidelines and markets to kind of take a breath after a really, really strong five months of gains."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.12 percent, to 37,753, the S&P 500 lost 0.58 percent, to 5,022 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.15 percent, to 15,683.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are scheduled to speak later in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among gainers, United Airlines surged 17.45 percent after it forecast stronger-than-expected current-quarter numbers. JB Hunt Transport Services slumped 8.12 percent as the worst performer on the S&P 500 after the trucking firm missed Wall Street estimates for first-quarter results. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the government's Digital Economy Development Committee, which he chairs, has come up with 12 recommendations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They cover five key areas, namely strengthening digital policy, IT infrastructure, cross-border data flow, getting businesses to adopt new technology and attracting qualified people, Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposals include setting up a digital policy office to help make the city smarter, getting a super computing centre up and running by the end of the year, extending commercial data interchange to offer loans to businesses effectively, and a study on data trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see clear potential for international data trading to become a new and thriving industry in this city. With that in mind, we have commissioned an expert group to study how best to develop a robust data trading system in Hong Kong. This is an area of tremendous promise for us,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister's remarks were made at the Digital Economy Summit, where he also said that the digital economy has clearly emerged as a new “driving force” for global economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The landscape is complex and rapidly changing, competition among cities and economies in this field is intense, Hong Kong must move fast to stay ahead of the curve,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong stressed that new technology should be used in a sustainable way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “How we are going to achieve a sustainable future is the development by maintaining a balance between using technology in an intelligent way while at the same time promoting, creating, and maximising the long-term value by using technology in a safe and responsible way,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq sank more than two percent on Friday following a poor investor response to Netflix earnings that exacerbated worries over next week's deluge of earnings from tech giants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 2.1 percent at 15,282, with Netflix sinking 9.1 percent and artificial intelligence leader Nvidia losing 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 percent to 37,986, and the S&P 500 declined 0.9 percent to 4,967.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netflix reported a profit of US$2.3 billion, topping earnings expectations on a jump in subscribers. The drop appeared to be tied to commentary about the current quarter which suggested growth was moderating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results come ahead of reports next week from other key tech names, including Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The way Netflix has responded has created some consternation about the mega stocks' ability to live up to expectations," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, who cited downcast comments from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company earlier in the week as a driver of Friday's poor showing by chip stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks have had a rough week due in part to unease over the Middle East and shifting expectations on US monetary policy, with traders betting the US central bank will delay cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other companies reporting results, American Express jumped 6.2 percent after reporting a 34 percent increase in quarterly profits to US$2.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla dropped 1.9 percent following the recall of nearly 4,000 Cybertrucks over an acceleration defect. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy grew 5.3 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, official data showed on Tuesday, comfortably beating analysts' expectations, a welcome sign for policymakers as they try to shore up demand and confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters news agency had expected first-quarter gross domestic product to expand 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared to 5.2 percent in the previous three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics deputy commissioner, said the nation had made solid progress over the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Generally, in the first quarter, the national economy made a good start, accumulating positive factors and laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual goal," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, we should say that there are rising complexities and uncertainties in the external environment," he said, adding that authorities will boost economic vitality, prevent and diffuse risks, as well as enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland officials are aiming for economic growth of around five percent for 2024, a target that many analysts believe is ambitious and may require more stimulus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, retail sales and industrial production in China slowed in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1 percent year-on-year in March, down from a 5.5 percent increase in the first two months of 2024, while industrial production rose 4.5 percent, down from a 7 percent increase in the first two months, official data showed. (Reuters/AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street indices closed marginally lower, except for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which managed a slight gain. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749537_1_L_20240419031604.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Thursday after another volatile session as rising US Treasury bond yields reflected dimming hopes for an imminent pivot in the Fed's monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Price action feeds on itself," Karl Haeling of LBBW said of the lacklustre session. "People see the market going down and they say, 'Get me out.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.1 percent gain at 37,775.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,011, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 15,601.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market's current posture towards pullbacks contrasts with the approach earlier in the year when investors eagerly stepped in to buy equities during periods of weakness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts attribute the shift in large part to the growing expectation that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates fewer times, if at all, in 2024, than was initially expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Netflix fell 0.4 percent ahead of its release of quarterly results. The company reported better-than-expected profits of $2.3 billion after the market closed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The streaming giant is the first major tech company to report this quarter. Other giants, such as Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta, are scheduled to report next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company fell 4.9 percent, citing "weakening macroeconomic conditions" and softening demand. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.

 Hong Kong's unemployment rate rose to 3 percent in three-month period ending in March, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That's a 0.1 percentage point increase compared with the December-to-February period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 9,400 people became jobless during the first quarter of 2024, with officials noting that there were 111,700 unemployed persons in the three-month period ending in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rate was generally low despite the uptick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The unemployment rates of most sectors increased in January - March 2024 compared with the preceding three-month period, but stayed low in general," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the economy continues to grow, the labour market will likely remain tight in the near term."

    L'Oreal cautious on China despite sales growth

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cosmetics giant L'Oreal says demand for mass market products in China has outpaced that in the United States. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749535_1_L_20240419024754.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 L'Oreal's chief executive gave a cautious outlook about China, the world's No. 2 beauty market, on Thursday even after the cosmetics maker reported first-quarter sales growth of more than 6 percent for the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter performance in China was well above sector growth of 1 percent, Nicolas Hieronimus told analysts in a call after the French cosmetics giant that owns the Maybelline and Lancome brands released better-than-expected first-quarter sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, he is not banking on any major improvement in consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We plan with, I would say, a China that is not doing fantastic, and we make the most of the opportunities in Europe, in emerging (markets) and gaining share in North America," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And if China accelerates, it will be a positive news on our own expectations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demand for mass market products in China has accelerated during the quarter to a greater extent than in the United States, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The make-up market has slowed the most in North America, although fragrance is doing "great", he said in the call. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US consumer inflation continued to accelerate last month, according to US government data published on Wednesday, reducing the chances of an early interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank has raised interest rates to the highest level in 23 years as it attempts to bring inflation back down firmly to its long-term target of two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Price increases have slowed significantly from their peak in 2022, but have crept higher in recent months, keeping the markets guessing about when the Fed could start cutting rates, even as other indicators of US economic strength have remained resilient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The annual consumer price index (CPI) came in at 3.5 percent in March, up 0.3 percentage points from February, the US Labour Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was slightly above expectations of a 3.4 percent rise, according to a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly inflation came in at 0.4 percent, also slightly above expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The indexes for shelter and gasoline together contributed "over half" of the monthly increase, according to the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A widely-watched inflation measure excluding volatile food and energy prices rose at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, in line with the data from February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The so-called "core" inflation index rose 0.4 percent in March from a month earlier, according to the Labour Department. (AFP)

    US stocks fall again amid geopolitical worries

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tensions in the Middle East weighed heavily on investor sentiment. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749050_1_L_20240416043054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished decisively lower on Monday despite solid US economic data, in a decline blamed on worries over conflict in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Equities had opened positively following solid retail sales data, amid early hopes that the conflict between Israel and Iran might ebb after a weekend siege by Iran was mostly repelled by air defences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israeli officials kept up the confrontational rhetoric, with Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi vowing a response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished at 37,735, down 0.7 percent after notching a 650-point fall from its peak earlier in the session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 1.2 percent to 5,061, while the Nasdaq fell 1.8 percent to 15,885.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare pointed to the geopolitical situation as a factor in Monday's drop, but also noted that the retreat follows a period of market strength.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you set aside what's happening geopolitically there have been calls for a while now that the market's due for a pullback," O'Hare said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So there's an overdue period of consolidation kicking in here, which has been helped along by the geopolitical uncertainty, rising interest rates, and again, the technical deterioration in the market."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Goldman Sachs rose 2.9 percent after reporting better-than-expected profits on a strong performance across most businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla slumped 5.6 percent after Elon Musk's electric vehicle company announced it was cutting more than 10 percent of its global headcount amid rising competition for EVs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salesforce plunged 7.3 percent following reports it is in talks to buy technology company Informatica. Informatica lost 6.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company associated with the ex-president and current US Republican White House nominee, dove 18.4 percent after announcing plans to issue more shares. (AFP)

    HKEX sees profit drop 13pc in Q1

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday reported a 13 percent annual decline in its net profit in the first quarter of this year, as lower turnover weighed on fees, while fewer listings eroded revenues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the city’s bourse showed the group’s profit stood at HK$2.97 billion for the first three months of the year, compared with the HK$3.4 billion seen in the same period a year ago when economic activities rebounded after Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue and other income also declined, dropping 6 percent year on year to HK$5.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declines came as average daily trading turnover dropped 22 percent year on year to HK$99.4 billion, while listing fees fell 25 percent year on year following the reduction in the number of new listings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the lower income was partially offset by strong derivatives trading, record quarterly high turnover in the Northbound Stock Connect, as well as increased trades at its subsidiary, the London Metal Exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year,” said the group’s newly appointed chief executive Bonnie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Despite a fragile global backdrop, the group’s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly - the former achieving record quarterly volume,” she said, adding there was a notable increase in daily trading volume in March and April, indicating growing confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX’s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fast-growing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond,” Chan said.

    Investors lured by the promise of golden returns

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gold is proving attractive once more to investors. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749569_1_L_20240419114002.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 When Vincent Yuan, a resident of Hebei province on the mainland, wanted to get something nice for his wife, he bought a piece of golden gourd jewellery, spending about 28,000 yuan at a local jewellery shop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There was also some strategic thinking behind the 35-year-old general manager’s decision, adding he bought the jewellery because he believes there’s real value to be gained from investing in the precious yellow metal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People like buying stuff which sees its value go up and not down, so if prices keep going up, we’ll of course buy more, and vice versa, if prices go down, then we won’t buy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gold is like a go-to preference for Chinese people,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His wife, Catrina Xu, 30, is also a fan of gold jewellery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a trip to Hong Kong last year, the only souvenir Xu purchased were gold items — a bracelet from a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui and a necklace when she visited Hong Kong Disneyland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since then, prices have gone up a lot over the past nine months,” she noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were among thousands of mainland Chinese shoppers who see the precious metal as a safe-haven investment to hedge against devaluation amid economic uncertainties as property prices in the country fall and its stock markets slump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since December last year, retail prices for gold from China’s major brands have risen 21 percent to a multi-year high of over 730 yuan (US$100) per gram as of April 12, from the 600 yuan (US$82) range seen in December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In New York, bullion prices notched another record close on April 15, with the most-active June contract for gold futures settling at US$2,383 per ounce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have been surprised by the strength in gold that we've seen since the start of 2024,” said John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bullion veteran said while the Chinese retail buying spree had been a major contributor to the global gold price spikes, other drivers included tensions in the Middle East, and speculative buyers on the Comex futures market in New York, which lifted prices higher over the past six weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comex is the leading platform for trading futures contracts on precious and base metals, such as gold, silver, and copper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is very much an emerging market phenomena led by China - together with speculative buying [on Comex].”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As has been the incredible purchases by central banks, which has been going on for nearly two years now," Reade said, noting that global central banks had ramped up their gold purchases in 2022 and 2023, to diversify their foreign reserves and reduce their dependency on US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the council's 2023 annual report, about one fourth of global central banks intend to increase their holdings of gold this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The People’s Bank of China, in particular, regained the crown for the largest single gold buyer in 2023, as it reported a total rise of 225 tonnes in its gold reserves over the year, marking its highest level of annual buying since at least 1977.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And all the indications are that it’s continued,” Reade added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American bank Citi on Tuesday forecast that gold is set to reach US$3,000 an ounce over the next six to 18 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lender noted the start of US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts - or a potential recession - would further drive demand for gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another financial giant, Goldman Sachs, last Friday referred to the “unshakeable bull market” in gold and upgraded its price target for the precious metal to US$2,700 an ounce by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would expect gold to benefit from interest rate cuts if and when they materialise in the United States and other important markets. That's likely to help gold performance,” Reade agreed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he cautioned that the metal tends to deliver returns that are only around three percent higher than US inflation in the long term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say US$3,000 an ounce over the next six to 18 months could be quite a stretch from where we are now… That said, there’s certainly the ingredients in place for the strength that we’ve seen in gold to continue for the next year or two,” adding that prices could still be volatile in the short term.

    Cybertruck recalled over accelerator pedal glitch

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla is recalling 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles because of a defect that can cause unintentional vehicle acceleration, increasing crash risk, according to a US notice posted this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tesla notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on April 17 of the condition in which the accelerator pedal may become trapped on the Cybertruck, Elon Musk's futuristic take on the American pickup truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the accelerator pedal becomes trapped, "the performance and operation of the pedal will be affected, which may increase the risk of a collision," Tesla said in the notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla said it was not aware of any collisions or injuries related to the condition. The company will replace or rework the accelerator to address the issue, the company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has championed the Cybertruck, declaring at a launch event last November that "Finally, the future will look like the future!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the vehicle's use of large flat plates of unbent stainless steel poses challenges in manufacturing. Musk has said it will take time to ramp up production, targeting 2025 as the year when output will reach 250,000 a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Tesla announced it would lay off more than 10 percent of its global workforce as it contends with rising competition among electric vehicle producers and slowing demand growth in some markets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.

    EU says Facebook can't charge users for privacy

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Facebook owner Meta and other online platforms must not force users to pay for the right to data protection enshrined in EU law when offering ad-free subscriptions, the European data regulator said Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Online platforms should give users a real choice when employing 'consent or pay' models," the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) chair Anu Talus said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The models we have today usually require individuals to either give away all their data or to pay," he said. "As a result, most users consent to the processing in order to use a service, and they do not understand the full implications of their choices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta in November launched a "pay or consent" system allowing users to withhold use of their data for ad targeting in exchange for a monthly fee – a model that has faced several challenges from privacy and consumer advocates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta has long profited from selling user data to advertisers but this business model has led to multiple battles with EU regulators over data privacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest announcement came after the data protection authorities of The Netherlands, Norway and the German state of Hamburg went to the EDPB for an opinion regarding the pay-or-consent model used by Meta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All digital platforms must comply with the European Union's mammoth general data protection regulation (GDPR), which has been at the root of EU court cases against Meta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EDPB in its opinion argued that Meta's model was at odds with the GDPR's requirement that consent for data use must be freely given.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In most cases, it will not be possible for large online platforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent if they confront users only with a binary choice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes and paying a fee," the opinion read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EDPB also warned the type of subscription service put forward by Meta "should not be the default way forward" for platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It suggested that platforms should consider an alternative that would give users the right to reject being tracked for advertising purposes without the need to pay. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered higher on Monday, shrugging off recent weakness at the start of a heavy week of earnings from technology and industrial companies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The markets are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the tensions in the Middle East didn't escalate," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Friday, in part due to selling ahead of the weekend amid fears of a worsening in the Israel-Iran conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,239.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 5,010, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.1 percent to 15,451.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 finished in positive territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's earnings calendar includes results from tech titans such as Amazon and Microsoft, as well as from industrial companies including Chevron and General Motors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla, which also reports this week, fell 3.4 percent following another round of price cuts – the latest sign of intensifying competition among electric vehicle manufacturers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verizon dropped 4.6 percent as analysts cited worries about a soft demand picture, with net broadband subscriber additions slowing compared with the prior quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike slid 0.4 percent after disclosing to state officials in Oregon that it plans to cut 740 jobs from its headquarters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks ended lower in choppy trading on Tuesday as Treasury yields climbed, with investors weighing the likely path of interest rates in a resilient US economy with persistent inflation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday recent inflation data has not given policymakers enough confidence to ease credit soon, noting that the US central bank may need to keep rates higher for longer than previously thought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average got a boost from UnitedHealth Group's better-than-expected quarterly results. Real estate and utilities were the biggest drags on the S&P 500, while technology gave the largest boost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are trying to balance this two-sided narrative: US economic growth, which looks really good, and at the same time the inflation picture and interest rates, which will eventually be problematic for the equity market," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, to 37,799, the S&P 500 lost 0.21 percent, to 5,051 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.12 percent, to 15,865.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are nearly 4 percent off from record high levels reached last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 2.5 percent after its first-quarter profit beat estimates on resurging income from investment banking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bank of America dropped 3.5 percent after the lender posted lower first-quarter profits as its loan loss provisions grew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson & Johnson slipped 2.1 percent as the drugmaker's revenue missed analysts' estimates after sales from its blockbuster psoriasis drug, Stelara, fell short of expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla slipped 2.7 percent a day after falling over 5 percent on news that the EV marker plans to lay off more than 10 percent of its global workforce. (Reuters)

    China's foreign trade falls sharply in March

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s exports contracted sharply in March while imports also unexpectedly shrank, underlining the task facing the country’s policymakers as they try to shore up a sluggish economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Figures from the General Administration of Customs showed that shipments from China slumped 7.5 percent year-on-year to US$279.7 billion, marking the largest fall since last August and missing market forecasts of a 3 percent decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came in sharp contrast to a 7.1 percent rise during the January-February period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, also declined last month, dropping 1.9 percent year-on-year to US$221.1 billion, missing an expected 1.4 percent rise. The first two months of the year had seen growth of 3.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest figures left the country’s trade surplus at US$58.6 billion last month, compared with US$125.1 billion in the January-February period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first quarter, however, both imports and exports rose 1.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By region, exports to the US fell 1.3 percent, while imports from the US fell nearly 11 percent in the first quarter. Shipments to Russia rose 3 percent, while those from Russia rose 7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) remained China’s largest trading partner with exports to the region rising 4.1 percent during the first quarter and imports from the region growing 1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang Lingjun, vice minister of the General Administration of Customs, said that while geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism have brought challenges to global trade, there are signs of a gradual recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects the country’s trade to stabilise in the second quarter. (Reuters)

 Official data released on Friday showed that the number of bankruptcy petitions in March was at their highest since November last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Official Receiver's Office, there were 783 bankruptcy petitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's up nearly 21 percent from February and around 2.8 percent year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also received 69 requests to have companies wound up, up around 30 percent from the month before and 41 percent from the same period last year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Iran was the world's seventh-largest crude producer in 2022. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748862_1_L_20240414232003.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's attack on Israel has injected fresh anxiety into oil markets already roiled by regional tensions, but analysts stress that it is unclear if a durable price spike is imminent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Saturday's overnight drone and missile barrage was Iran's first-ever direct assault on Israeli territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tehran says it was triggered by the April 1 air strike on its consulate building in the Syrian capital that was widely blamed on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Iranian mission to the United Nations warned on X of "considerably more severe" actions should Israel "make another mistake," raising the prospect of intensifying violence in the days ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices had already jumped in the build-up to the Iranian attack, with benchmark Brent North Sea Crude closing on Friday at US$90.45 per barrel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices are expected to climb further when markets reopen on Monday, perhaps as high as US$95 per barrel, though it is too soon to say whether they will stay elevated, said Kuwaiti oil expert Kamel al-Harami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The picture is not clear about the future. We do not know if and how Israel will respond and whether Iran will also resort to stopping oil supplies as a response," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamic republic was the world's seventh-largest crude producer in 2022, and has the third-largest proven oil reserves behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran also has a range of ways to wreak havoc with markets, including disrupting maritime traffic through the Strait of Hormuz and pressuring countries such as Iraq to cut supply, Harami said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are several scenarios... The fear is that Iran will stop exporting oil or attack oil facilities," Harami said. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  General Electric, Spotify Technology and Kimberly-Clark were among the companies winning strong gains after quarterly reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com described the broad gains as "follow-through buying" after a rough period that generated talk that the market was "oversold" on a short-term basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,503.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent to 5,070, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6 percent to 15,696.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After last week's losses, US stocks began the week on Monday on a solid note, advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, General Motors shot up 4.4 percent as it lifted its full-year forecast following better than expected quarterly earnings. The automaker continued to point to solid pricing in the United States, which helped offset weakness in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GE Aerospace gained 8.3 percent after lifting its projections after reporting an uptick in orders and operating profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But JetBlue sank 18.9 percent as it projected lower revenues in the second quarter, noting that there is "significant elevated capacity" in the company's Latin region, pressuring results. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC declined to comment on reports it would cut jobs. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749360_1_L_20240418051015.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Morgan Stanley and HSBC are cutting dozens of investment banking jobs in the Asia Pacific region this week, sources said, as they ramp up cost-cutting, with weaker dealmaking and sluggish markets weighing on business prospects.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Morgan Stanley is cutting at least 50 investment banking jobs in the region starting this week, three sources with knowledge of the matter said, affecting around 13 percent of the Wall Street bank's Asia investment banking workforce of 400.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Layoffs at the investment banking unit of HSBC, which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, started on Tuesday and are expected to see the departure of around 30 dealmakers in the region this week, three separate sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All of the sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the job cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An HSBC spokesperson said the banks is continuing to invest in and grow its business, allocating people and resources to the immediate opportunities, but declined to comment on the job cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, Bank of America laid off around 20 bankers in the region, following a flurry of investment bank downsizing by UBS, Citigroup and other boutique firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside Asia, US banking giants overall continued to shed employees in the first quarter, with Citigroup seeing the biggest drop. Banks are under pressure to control costs due to the uncertain economic outlook. (Reuters)
