<div class="itemFullText">
 Warren Buffett said he expects the US government to increase taxes to tackle widening fiscal deficits rather than reduce spending.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think higher taxes are likely," he said on Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They may decide that some day they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large because that has some important consequences. So they may not want to decrease spending and they may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we own, and we’ll pay it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated in its latest long-term budget projections federal deficits will rise to 8.5 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal 2054 from 5.5 percent in fiscal 2024. US budget deficits are expected to deteriorate if tax cuts introduced in 2017 are renewed next year. (Reuters)

    Jobs and Apple send Wall Street surging

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street surged to a higher close on Friday as a softer-than-expected employment report bolstered the case for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve while also providing evidence of US economic resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three major US stock posted robust gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the pack, rising 2 percent with an assist from Apple shares following the iPhone maker's record share buyback announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three indexes notched their second straight Friday-to-Friday gains, capping a week in which markets were encouraged by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's more dovish-than-expected statements following Wednesday's rate decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's employment report showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected, while the unemployment rate ticked higher and wage growth unexpectedly cooled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report likely hit the sweet spot for the Fed, offering signs the labor market is softening, which Powell has deemed necessary to put inflation on a sustainable downward path. The report also provided assurances on US economic health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report prompted investors to raise bets the Fed would implement its first rate reduction in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investor narrative remains the Fed and interest rates and today’s weak jobs report puts rate cuts firmly on the Fed’s 2024 agenda," said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments in New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed officials weighed in on the data. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her willingness to hike rates if inflation progress reverses, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the employment report boosted confidence the economy is not overheating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple surged 6.0 percent, after the company unveiled a record US$110 billion share buyback program and beat quarterly expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Travel platform Expedia cut its full-year revenue growth forecast, sending its shares sliding 15.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18 percent, to 38,676, the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent, to 5,128 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.99 percent, to 16,156. (Reuters)

    US job growth slows, boosting rate cut hopes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The jobs report raised hopes of cuts to interest rates. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751704_1_L_20240504011035.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US job growth slowed more than expected in April and the increase in annual wages fell below 4.0 percent for the first time in nearly three years, but it is probably too early to expect that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates before September as the labour market remains fairly tight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate rising to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent in March amid increasing labour supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless, the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for the 27th straight month. Data this week showed job openings declining in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of labour market cooling raised optimism that the US central bank could after all engineer a "soft-landing" for the economy and doused chatter of stagflation, which had been fanned by news of a sharp moderation in economic growth and a surge in inflation in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Financial markets boosted the odds of a September rate cut and saw the Fed reducing borrowing costs twice this year instead of only once before the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A cooler pace of hiring to a more sustainable pace should be interpreted as beneficial with respect to the inflation outlook going forward and remove any lingering concerns of a wage price spiral and put to bed loose and undisciplined talk from the corners of the trading community about stagflation," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000 jobs last month, the fewest in six months, the Labour Department's Bureau of Labour Statistics said. Revisions showed 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than previously reported.  (Reuters)

    HSBC not planning more asset sales: chairman
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HSBC says it will keep offering strong returns to shareholders. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751701_1_L_20240503232729.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC has no current plans to sell more assets, its chairman Mark Tucker said on Friday at the annual shareholder meeting of the bank, which has scaled back its presence in Western markets in recent years as part of a sweeping overhaul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  HSBC shareholders met in London days after the bank's CEO Noel Quinn announced his surprise retirement following a five-year tenure which saw HSBC sell retail banking operations in France and the US, and its entire Canadian unit, as it pivots towards Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman's comments hint at a likely shift in direction for whomever succeeds Quinn, as the bank turns its focus away from shrinking its global empire to trying to grow its business in its remaining markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shareholders, as expected, backed a resolution to lift a cap on the size of bonuses HSBC can pay its top UK bankers, after Britain axed a policy limiting payouts that it had inherited from the European Union. Goldman Sachs is removing the cap and other banks are expected to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to shareholders at the meeting, Tucker also said HSBC was in a strong position to continue paying robust dividends despite an uncertain global economic outlook and central bank policy moves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank, which returned US$19 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share buybacks, has announced a further US$8.8 billion so far for 2024, and is targeting a dividend payout ratio of 50 percent this year, Tucker said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC has been able to splash out on such shareholder rewards in recent years as rising central bank interest rates have boosted its lending income, turbo-charging its profits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inflation remains key to the global interest rate outlook, Tucker said. HSBC economists forecast that global inflation will fall gradually to 5.8 percent in 2024 and 3.8 percent in 2025, having climbed as high as 6.3 percent in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank expects the European Central Bank and Bank of England to cut rates in June, both lowering by 150 basis points by the end of 2025, and expects the US Federal Reserve to cut in September, cutting by 100 basis points by the same time. (Reuters)

    HK retail sales fall 7 percent in March

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751663_1_L_20240503175013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales fell 7 percent in March from a year earlier, ending 15 months of growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to figures released by the Census And Statistics Department on Friday, sales totalled HK$31.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decline followed a 1.9 percent increase in February, and 0.9 percent growth in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, retail sales for the first quarter of 2024 fell by 1.3 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government blamed the drop on the high base of comparison for visitor spending and the timing of the Easter holidays last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It predicted that the retail sector will benefit from a continued tourism revival and rising household income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further revival of inbound tourism and rising household income should remain supportive to the retail sector. The government's efforts to promote a mega event economy and boost sentiment should also help. Yet, the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents may continue to pose challenges," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Annie Tse, said the sales drop was a result of more Hongkongers heading to the mainland in their free time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The northbound travel and consumption will continue since transportation is too convenient nowadays, and it is the trend. I would not say it's something that we want, but it's quite normal. We, as retailers, have to face the situation, and that will definitely be a continuing effect that will affect our industry," she said.

    Apple beats Q1 expectations, announces share buyback

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Apple has announced its biggest ever share buyback. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751578_1_L_20240503051021.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple on Thursday reported a smaller than expected decline in quarterly revenue, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company expects a return to sales growth in the current quarter as it invests in AI features to be unveiled in the coming months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Apple increased its cash dividend by 4 percent and authorised an additional programme to buy back US$110 billion of its stock. The buyback is the largest in the company's history, according to Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Apple surged roughly 7 percent in extended trade after the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple said fiscal second-quarter revenue fell 4 percent to US$90.8 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of US$90.01 billion, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Apple's current quarter, which ends in June, Cook said the iPhone maker expects "to grow low-single digits" in overall revenue. Wall Street expects 1.33 percent revenue growth to US$82.89 billion, according to LSEG data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple faces a raft of challenges across its business. Smartphone rivals such as Samsung Electronics have introduced competing devices aimed at hosting artificial-intelligence chatbots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the regulatory front, Apple's services business, which contains its lucrative App Store and was one of the few areas of growth in the fiscal second quarter, is under pressure from a new law in Europe. In the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolising the smartphone market and driving up prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the fiscal second quarter, IPhone sales fell 10.5 percent to US$45.96 billion, compared with analyst expectations of US$46 billion. Apple executives said in February that the year-ago fiscal second quarter had benefited from a US$5 billion surge in iPhone sales as the company caught up from supply-chain snarls during pandemic lockdowns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling 10 percent this year. (Reuters)

    Dovish Fed talk helps Wall Street rally

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751576_1_L_20240503044554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rallied on Thursday as investors weighed the Federal Reserve's more dovish-than-expected interest rate guidance on Wednesday against a plethora of mixed earnings and economic data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All three indexes ended in positive territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way, advancing 1.5 percent with a healthy boost from chip stocks after Qualcomm reported quarterly sales and profit above analysts' expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets continued to parse Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assurances on Wednesday that the central bank's next policy move will be to lower its key policy rate, after it left rates unchanged at the end of its monthly meeting. However, he noted that recent strong inflation readings have suggested that first of these rate cuts could be a long time in coming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The takeaway from yesterday is that the Fed's bias is still a downward, hold steady or cut rates," said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist at Murphy & Silvest in Elmhurst, Illinois.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They're not willing to raise rates from here. They'll keep rates steady, and any sign of economic weakness or lower inflation, they are going to be ready to jump on it and cut."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Data released on Thursday included muted jobless claims, a drop in planned layoffs, a surge in quarterly labour costs and a sharp deceleration in productivity, all of which throws focus on Friday's closely watched April employment report.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's securities regulator says it has started an insider dealing prosecution against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday said it had started criminal proceedings against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its founder, director and chief investment officer Simon Sadler, and former trader Daniel La Rocca for the offence of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company prior to a block trade in June 2017.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SFC said the two defendants appeared at Eastern Magistrates' Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned to June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, a British businessman, is also the owner of Blackpool Football Club which competes in England's EFL League One division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Established in 2007, Segantii is one of the oldest and biggest hedge funds in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from Hong Kong, it also has operations in London, New York and Dubai, according to its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on its website, Blackpool Football Club said the charges were entirely unrelated to the club, and its day-to-day operations would not be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that Mr Sadler will vigorously defend himself against the charge, and there will be no further comments at the time from the Club," the statement added. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    HK logs 'better-than-expected' growth in Q1

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's economy grew 2.7 percent year on year in the first three months of 2024, according to official advanced estimates. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751525_1_L_20240502181916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s economy grew at a better-than-expected rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter, partially boosted by the steady rise in exports of goods and services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  However, that growth was lower compared with the 4.3 percent figure seen in the last quarter of 2023, according to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the city’s finance chief indicated that first quarter growth would be in line with the projected full-year growth range at between 2.5 and 3.5 percent for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Simon Lee, honorary fellow at Chinese University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Business, said the number was better than expected, but noted the momentum might not be sustainable in the coming quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My original estimate [for the first quarter] was about one to two percent growth. But the 2.7 percent growth also came on a relatively low base in the first quarter last year when the borders just opened and economic activities were just reactivated,” Lee told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see that it’s quite remarkable in terms of exports and imports of goods and services [in the first quarter]… but if you look at local consumption… quite a number of local people went elsewhere for spending and this will have a significant effect on the GDP growth.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[Although] exports tend to do well at the end of the year, there are also variable factors, such as the economic situation on the mainland and geopolitical issues, so I am still quite cautious on the full-year growth,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee warned Hong Kong could see growth slow to about one or two percent in the coming quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysing the major economic components, the growth of private consumption, capital formation, as well as the imports of goods and services all slowed during the three-month period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, exports of goods increased by 6.7 percent year on year, significantly higher compared with the 2.8 percent growth seen in the final quarter of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports of services rose by a notable 8.1 percent year on year in the quarter, although the pace was much slower compared with the 21.2 percent growth seen in Q4 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, exports of services should be supported by further revival of inbound tourism alongside the continued recovery of handling capacity and the government's efforts to promote a mega event economy,” a government spokesperson commented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Domestically, rising household income and the government's initiatives to boost sentiment should help private consumption, but the changing consumption pattern of residents may pose challenges. [And] a longer period of tight financial conditions may have some dampening effects on economic confidence and activities,” the spokesperson added.

    HKMA again leaves key interest rate unchanged

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says high interest rates may " for="" last="" photo:="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rthk"="" some="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751462_1_L_20240502105734.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto" time".=""/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday again kept its key interest rate unchanged at 5.75 percent, saying “high rates may last for some time”.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move by the city’s de facto central bank came in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve which earlier kept its target rate at a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.5 percent, citing “hotter-than-expected” price pressures as well as growth reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, HKMA said the Fed “has not yet gained enough confidence about the US inflation trajectory to start cutting interest rates”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The high interest rate environment may last for some time,” it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said the city’s financial and monetary markets are operating in a smooth and orderly manner, but warned that the interbank offered rate (Hibor) may remain high for the time being.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The public should carefully assess and manage the relevant risks when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HSBC took the lead among the city's banks in leaving its prime lending rate unchanged at 5.875 percent, while keeping interest rates on Hong Kong dollar savings accounts steady.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the one-month Hibor rate, which is used to price the majority of local mortgages, slightly rose to 4.34 percent, a three-week high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-month Hibor rate, which reflects banks’ funding costs, also rose slightly to a three-week high, at 4.58 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA and the Fed have kept their key lending rates unchanged since last July, after increasing them 11 times since March 2022.

 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Wednesday, concluding a volatile session after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates flat and signaled rate hikes were not probable.

    Binance chief Zhao jailed for four months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Changpeng Zhao arrives for his sentencing hearing in Seattle. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751333_1_L_20240501094516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Changpeng Zhao, the former chief executive of Binance, was sentenced on Tuesday to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Once considered the most powerful crypto industry figure, Zhao, known as "CZ," is the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle was significantly shorter than the three years sought by prosecutors, and below the maximum one and a half years recommended under federal guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also much lighter than the 25 years behind bars that Sam Bankman-Fried received in March for stealing US$8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, prosecutors cheered the outcome of what had been a years-long investigation into Binance and Zhao, a billionaire who had been living beyond US reach in the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was an epic day,” US Attorney Tessa Gorman told reporters outside the courthouse. “Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before handing down the sentence, Jones faulted Zhao for making Binance's growth and profitability a higher priority than complying with US laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You had the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to make sure that every single regulation had to be complied with, and so you failed at that opportunity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhao, 47, did not visibly react upon hearing his sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "'Crime pays' is the message sent today," Dennis Kelleher, head of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in an email, noting Zhao will still get to keep his vast wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors said Binance employed a "Wild West" model that welcomed criminals, and did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm sorry," Zhao told the judge before being sentenced. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Tuesday following disappointing economic data as US Treasury yields pushed higher ahead of a Federal Reserve decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since July 2022, missing expectations amid rising anxiety over the jobs market and future financial conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts also cited an uptick in US Treasury yields following data showing a jump in US employee compensation costs in the first quarter. The rise came as the Fed kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting.

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 percent to 37,815.

    Negative equity cases at their highest in two decades

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Negative equity cases at the end of March reached 32,073, the highest quarterly figure since 2004. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751249_1_L_20240430182154.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.

    Asia's first crypto ETFs gain in HK debut

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six spot bitcoin and ether exchange traded funds (ETFs) gained in their Hong Kong debut on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The launch of Asia's first cryptocurrency-based ETFs comes three months after a similar move in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unlike in the US, however, crypto enthusiasts in Hong Kong can also invest by swapping their own tokens, as well as buying with cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange, bitcoin ETFs launched by China AMC, Harvest and Bosera climbed more than 2 percent by midday, while three funds linked to ether were also up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a launch event, the executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission, Christina Choi, said the ETFs mark a milestone for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi warned would-be investors, however, that virtual assets aren't for everyone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Virtual assets themselves are highly speculative and their prices are extremely volatile. bitcoin and ether have in the past experienced a 40 percent drop in a single day and over 60 percent drop within a year," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Therefore, I would like to remind everyone that virtual assets are not suitable for all investors. Only those who have a thorough understanding of them and can withstand the risks should consider these products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, Bonnie Chan, said the ETFs will boost the local market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The listing of six virtual asset ETFs today will further enrich Hong Kong's ETF product offerings. It will attract more investors to participate in the Hong Kong ETF market, enhance market liquidity, promote Hong Kong's development as an attractive ETF market in Asia, and strengthen its competitiveness as an international asset management hub," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan told the same event that the listings demonstrate Hong Kong's status as a leading virtual assets market in Asia.

    HSBC says chief executive Noel Quinn 'to retire'

<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn will retire, the bank said on Tuesday, in a surprise departure from the business that he has overhauled in the past five years through a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it has already launched a formal process to find a successor, with Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery likely the leading internal candidate for the job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, HSBC reported a 1.8 percent drop in first-quarter profit as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia and amid inflationary pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pretax profit came in at US$12.7 billion for the quarter ended March versus US$12.9 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were better than the US$12.6 billion average of analysts' forecasts compiled by HSBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-headquartered bank also announced US$3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of US$2 billion in share purchases announced in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking during a media call, Quinn said he informed the group's chairman Mark Tucker of his decision last month, saying he wanted to have a better work-life balance after an "intense" five-year period in the top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would never have dreamed of being the CEO in the bank 37 years ago and it's a privilege. But you also have to look forward and say what's right for you personally, and I did a lot reflecting on that over Christmas, the New Year, and January," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's right for me, but also think it's right for the bank, it's a natural transition point for the bank," adding he would work hard to ensure a smooth transition for his successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tucker thanked Quinn for his leadership and for his years of work at the bank, and said he and the board fully "support and respect that decision". (Reuters)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HSBC group chairman also said the board and its nomination committee hoped to name a new chief executive in the second half of this year.

    China factory activity slows in April

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Official Chinese data showed slower manufacturing growth in April. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751150_1_L_20240430103806.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in April, an official factory survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting some loss of momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 50.4 in April from 50.8 in March, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and just ahead of a median forecast of 50.3 in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data underlines the challenges facing policymakers even though solid first quarter GDP growth had reduced some of the urgency to ramp up stimulus measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New export orders grew at a much slower rate, while employment continued to shrink, the NBS's PMI data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, a private Caixin factory survey, which was also released on Tuesday, showed manufacturing activity grew more quickly as new export orders rose, providing a more optimistic outlook than the official data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors expect Beijing to launch more stimulus to support the economy and were waiting for the outcome of a politburo meeting, which is expected to focus on economic affairs this month. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Monday, extending a rally from late last week ahead of a Federal Reserve decision and key earnings reports in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A news-jammed week includes Wednesday's Fed decision, where the central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but will update investors on the prospects for cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors will also digest April jobs data, as well as surveys measuring manufacturing sector health and consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This week has something for everyone," said a note from Charles Schwab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones advanced 0.4 percent to 38,386.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 5,116, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 15,983.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple, Coca-Cola and Pfizer are among the large companies reporting quarterly earnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies in the S&P 500 have thus reported an average of 3.5 percent higher earnings compared with the year-ago period, according to Factset.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Tesla shot up nearly 15 percent after receiving a key security clearance from the Chinese government for smart cars during a visit to China by Chief Executive Elon Musk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple gained 2.7 percent following an upgrade from equity analysts at Bernstein.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Domino's Pizza jumped 5.6 percent as it reported a 6.1 percent increase in first-quarter sales to US$4.4 billion. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan says first quarter economic growth is expected to fall within the 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent range. Photo courtesy of the secretary's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750893_1_L_20240428120932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday Hong Kong's GDP growth in the first quarter is expected to be in line with the government's forecast of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the advance estimates for the January-March period, which will be announced on Thursday, would reflect moderate growth for the economy for five straight quarters, dating back to the start of 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Besides opening up new points for economic growth, we also need to continue to consolidate the traditional elements," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holidays would attract an estimated 800,000 visitors to Hong Kong, highlighted by a maiden pyrotechnic display at Victoria Harbour on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary said a series of mega events will follow, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, the World Cultures Festival and the Vinexpo Asia for a showcase of wine and spirits late next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On stocks, Chan said the Hang Seng Index rose by 8.8 percent in the past week, its best weekly performance in 13 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the surge to tech shares buoyed by AI and IT developments, as well as stimulus measures by mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that an updated scheme allowing some mainland residents to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong made tremendous strides last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect Scheme recorded more than 13.1 billion yuan in transactions in March, which the finance chief said was close to half of the total amount since the scheme's launch in late 2021.

    Alphabet, Microsoft power gains on Wall Street

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street closed higher, particularly technology stocks. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750769_1_L_20240427042348.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft in addition to moderate inflation data.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 38,239, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent to 5,099, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.0 percent to 15,927.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors cheered Alphabet's first-ever dividend, its US$70 billion stock buyback program, and better-than-expected first-quarter results. Its shares jumped to a record high, lifting the Google-parent's market value above US$2 trillion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft shares rose after its third-quarter revenue and profit exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by gains from artificial intelligence (AI) adoption across its cloud services. On Wednesday, Meta results had disappointed investors even as the company ratcheted up spending on AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The earnings reports of Microsoft and Google allayed a lot of the concerns about the fact that the spending on data centers and AI, which Meta had raised a day before, was going to compress margins," said Tom Plumb, president and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin.

  "Both Google and Microsoft had indicated that with their current capital plans, they still expected their margins to expand. That allayed a lot of the fears that people had about the growth of data computing," Plumb added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Commerce Department data showed monthly inflation rose moderately in March on an annual basis while coming in line with estimates on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report offered some relief to financial markets spooked by worries of stagflation a day after data showed inflation surging and economic growth slowing in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the data, money markets priced in a firmer chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after the data, last standing at 4.6692 percent  .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Snap surged after the social media firm beat first-quarter estimates for revenue and user growth. Pinterest shares also finished higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exxon Mobil lost ground after America's largest oil company missed analysts' estimates with first-quarter profit falling 28 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intel dropped after the chipmaker's forecast for second-quarter revenue and profit did not meet estimates. Intel faces weak demand for its traditional data centre and PC chips. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank's favoured measure of inflation accelerated last month, according to government data published on Friday, pushing back the chances of an interest rate cut this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hotter print is likely to cement the view that inflation, while down sharply since 2022, remains a challenge, and could keep the Federal Reserve on pause as it seeks to battle rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also complicates US president Joe Biden's re-election message as he seeks to convince sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in March, up 0.2 percentage points from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was above the median forecast of 2.6 percent in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the overall annual rise came from the services sector, which increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the more volatile items, energy prices rose by 2.6 percent from a year ago, while food prices were up 1.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While inflation has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak, today's report reinforces the importance of our ongoing work to bring costs down," White House national economic advisor Lael Brainard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, PCE inflation rose by 0.3 percent, in line with the figure from February, the Commerce Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closely watched "core" measure of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in March, unchanged from a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The March figures reaffirm the concern among economists that inflation is proving to be more stubborn than previously thought -- complicating the Federal Reserve's fight to bring it down firmly to its long-term target of two percent through interest rate hikes. (AFP)

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices rebounded in March, rising one percent month-on-month and ending a 10-month falling streak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department showed that the official private flat price index edged up to 305.7, from 302.5 in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, prices were still more than 13 percent lower on a yearly basis and 23 percent lower than the all-time high recorded in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents also edged up in March, rising 0.5 percent on a monthly basis, or 5.6 percent on an annual basis, following a two-month falling streak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increases came after the government lifted all remaining property cooling measures in the budget in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The city’s property market has seen a revenge-style rebound after the lifting of the cooling measures, as the buyers’ sentiment noticeably improved,” said Martin Wong, director and head of research & consultancy, Greater China, at Knight Frank Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “However, prices of lived-in homes may continue to weaken due to the impact of sales of new homes. And as the interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve may also come later than the markets anticipated, meaning the city may start cutting rates from late third quarter, the high rates may continue weighing on the market.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at Colliers Hong Kong, struck a cautious note on the property price outlook due to surging supplies and an uncertain path for interest rate cuts, saying she expects a five to 10 percent fall over the year.

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750596_1_L_20240426050729.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed lower on Thursday as markets were stunned by data showing slower-than-expected US economic growth and persistent inflation, coupled with a sell-off in large cap stocks triggered by disappointing results from Meta Platforms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data on Thursday showed that the US economy grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in the first quarter while inflation accelerated, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting interest rates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disappointing results from Meta, whose shares plunged nearly 11 percent, also weighed on market sentiment. Three other Magnificent Seven stocks, including Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft, finished lower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, shares of Alphabet and Microsoft were advancing in extended hours trading after both companies reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below market estimates, sending its shares down 8 percent in extended hours trading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The GDP numbers definitely puts a ding in the paradigm that markets were hanging onto for equities in terms of high growth; and if you don't have high growth that will translate to lower-than-expected earnings," said James St Aubin, chief investment officer at Sierra Mutual Funds in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 percent, to 38,086, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 percent, to 5,048 and the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 15,612.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to still tight labour market conditions. The March Personal Consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The double whammy was also the inflation number that came in stronger than expected so there wasn't really a silver lining in that report; it's still positive in absolute terms but relative to high expectations it was disappointing," St. Aubin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International Business Machines fell 8 percent after it announced a US$6.4 billion deal to buy HashiCorp alongside its first-quarter results, in which revenue missed estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Southwest Airlines slid nearly 7 percent as the carrier slashed its projections for new aircraft deliveries from Boeing in 2024 for the third time. Caterpillar shed 7 percent after it cut second quarter sales forecasts as demand for its construction equipment eases from last year's boom. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exports increased 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite a slight decline in February, exports picked up 4.7 percent in March on a year-on-year basis, resulting in an overall surge for the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to Thailand saw the largest expansion, followed by those to the United Arab Emirates and the mainland, while shipments to the Netherlands dropped in the first three months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, imports saw 8 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said uncertainty remains in the city's exports performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions and a longer period of tight financial conditions will continue to affect Hong Kong's export performance, though the slightly better-than-expected external demand may provide some support," the spokesperson said.

    New tools needed to reduce FX risks: ABAC

<img alt="ABAC representatives conclude the council's meeting in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750512_2_L_20240425164048.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) on Thursday called for new tools to reduce foreign exchange risks due to concerns about widening interest rate differentials between the United States and emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It also urged greater digitisation of the trade process to boost economic integration within the Asia Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the end of a four-day meeting in Hong Kong, Tom Harley, an Australian ABAC member, said the council was studying an exchange rate tool known as a World Parity Unit which might be able to reduce foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unit represents an exchange rate between a basket of currencies from developed countries and those from emerging markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[So] rather than borrowing in US dollars and just having a single-currency risk, it borrows against a basket of world currencies, and it has the potential to reduce currency risk in cross-border borrowing, particularly for the energy transition, by up to 25 percent,” Harley noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are now working on how it can be implemented... to deal with a critical problem,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal comes as a strong US dollar, due to interest rates that have held steadily higher over a longer than expected period, continues to weigh on currencies in the Asia Pacific region, posing foreign exchange risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This concern was shared by Hiroshi Nakaso, ABAC’s Japanese member, who chairs the council’s finance and investment task force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan also called for greater efforts in promoting digitisation of the entire trade process in the Asia Pacific region to enhance economic integration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Currently many parts of the trade process, if not all, are conducted on a manual or paper basis, such as letter of credit or insurance policy. So this is incurring huge losses, opportunity costs, for the regional economy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The initiatives that I mentioned are intended to digitalise the entire trade process, so that the cost and the time required can be greatly reduced and help regional economic integration,” Nakaso said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Frank Ning, a China member who chairs ABAC's sustainability working group, called for a green free trade framework in the Asia Pacific to tackle climate change, noting that business groups in the region also wanted the trade environment to be improved - in the wake of rising Sino-US tensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have a very strong proposal between the Chinese delegation and the US delegation on ABAC to have a sustainable supply chain, which demonstrates the strong will from business to see an improved free trade environment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to see that back. We do not want to see a confrontational or trade barrier type of policy,” Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other key proposals include the empowerment of women in trade, boosting women’s participation in green trade and venture capital, noted Julia Torreblanca, the council’s chair for 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council, an advisory body to APEC economic leaders, held a meeting in Hong Kong between April 22 and 25, to promote free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with some 200 delegates in the city for the first time since 2015.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The benchmark S&P 500 closed higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, as investors weighed an uptick in Treasury yields amid positive corporate results particularly from technology giants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An auction of a record US$70 billion worth of five-year US Treasury notes on Wednesday helped to push bond yields higher and had weighed on equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose five basis points to 4.6459 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow finished lower while the Nasdaq ended higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also focused on quarterly earnings from companies, especially from megacap growth stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms fell 11 percent in extended hours trading after the tech giant reported that its capital expenditure could reach up to US$40 billion in 2024, even as its first quarter revenue beat estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their results later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla jumped 12 percent after the electric vehicle maker's plans to boost production and roll out more affordable models overshadowed its weak quarterly results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My biggest concern is the bond market, particularly the long end of the US yield curve," said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.02 percent to 5,072 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.10 percent, to 15,713. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11 percent, to 38,461.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Markets are eyeing first quarter gross domestic product data on Thursday and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for March on Friday. Hotter-than-expected consumer price inflation report for March had pushed back expectations of when the Fed will begin cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Boeing fell 2.8 percent after the planemaker reported its first quarterly revenue drop in seven quarters, even though the result beat analyst expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solar inverter maker Enphase Energy dropped 5.5 percent after projecting second-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Laura Cha says Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will continue to develop its global connectivity, as she steps down from her role as chairwoman. Photo: Online meeting" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750387_1_L_20240424185647.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairwoman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), Laura Cha, on Wednesday said the city’s stock exchange operator would continue to go “international” as it considered all options to stimulate market turnover.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came as Cha hosted her last annual general meeting with shareholders before stepping down from the role she held over the past six years after reaching a two-term limit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the meeting, Cha, 74, said the city’s bourse would continue developing connectivity with other exchanges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With regard to our international development, it’s not going to stop, it will continue,” Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not just about opening two [new] offices. Over the past year we have done a lot of work, we have also signed expressions of interest with two exchanges elsewhere, so that we will also be able to broaden the scope of listing to move forward,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted the group would consider measures that could stimulate trading volumes, adding HKEX welcomes all firms - no matter if they are big or small - to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Do we want bigger companies or smaller companies, that's not up to us to choose, it depends on what companies make applications. We extend fair and equal treatment to all applicants. Even for small companies if they can satisfy all the standards, they can still be listed,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came as some shareholders questioned whether the bourse would try and go after larger enterprises, such as electric-vehicle battery maker CATL, to list in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the exchange’s first female chair, Cha thanked shareholders and colleagues for their support over the past six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been a privilege and an honour to have presided over this great organisation over the past six years," Cha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Cha stepped down, the exchange’s new board of directors immediately appointed former Securities and Futures Commission chair, Carlson Tong, as the new HKEX chairman for a three-year term until 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong's appointment is subject to the written approval of the Chief Executive, and a further announcement will be issued later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cha, meanwhile, will continue to serve as senior advisor to the exchange’s board until April next year.

    HKEX sees profit drop 13pc in Q1

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) on Wednesday reported a 13 percent annual decline in its net profit in the first quarter of this year, as lower turnover weighed on fees, while fewer listings eroded revenues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the city’s bourse showed the group’s profit stood at HK$2.97 billion for the first three months of the year, compared with the HK$3.4 billion seen in the same period a year ago when economic activities rebounded after Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue and other income also declined, dropping 6 percent year on year to HK$5.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declines came as average daily trading turnover dropped 22 percent year on year to HK$99.4 billion, while listing fees fell 25 percent year on year following the reduction in the number of new listings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the lower income was partially offset by strong derivatives trading, record quarterly high turnover in the Northbound Stock Connect, as well as increased trades at its subsidiary, the London Metal Exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKEX demonstrated its strength and resilience in the first quarter of the year,” said the group’s newly appointed chief executive Bonnie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Despite a fragile global backdrop, the group’s derivatives and commodities business performed strongly - the former achieving record quarterly volume,” she said, adding there was a notable increase in daily trading volume in March and April, indicating growing confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, despite the prevailing backdrop, we are optimistic about HKEX’s ability to capitalise on the long-term growth of China, the considerable opportunities to connect with the fast-growing capital hubs of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and the continuing exciting developments in technology in our industry and beyond,” Chan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose for a second straight session on Tuesday, building on the prior day's positive momentum following a round of mostly good corporate earnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  General Electric, Spotify Technology and Kimberly-Clark were among the companies winning strong gains after quarterly reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com described the broad gains as "follow-through buying" after a rough period that generated talk that the market was "oversold" on a short-term basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,503.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 percent to 5,070, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.6 percent to 15,696.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After last week's losses, US stocks began the week on Monday on a solid note, advancing amid relief that there was no escalation in tensions between Iran and Israel over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, General Motors shot up 4.4 percent as it lifted its full-year forecast following better than expected quarterly earnings. The automaker continued to point to solid pricing in the United States, which helped offset weakness in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GE Aerospace gained 8.3 percent after lifting its projections after reporting an uptick in orders and operating profit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But JetBlue sank 18.9 percent as it projected lower revenues in the second quarter, noting that there is "significant elevated capacity" in the company's Latin region, pressuring results. (AFP)

    London's FTSE strikes record as global sentiment lifts

Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750239_1_L_20240423235344.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's FTSE 100 stocks index hit record highs on Tuesday, catching up with major global peers that have struck all-time peaks this year as inflation cools.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sentiment was upbeat across major world indices thanks to easing Middle East worries and hopes of interest-rate cuts, while traders are keenly awaiting the release this week of more major earnings and key US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London's FTSE 100 reached 8,076 points shortly after the open, surpassing a record 8,047 struck in February last year, though it pared down gains in afternoon deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good news as this is, it does highlight the sluggishness of the UK's top equity index when compared to its US and European competitors which hit a string of successive records throughout the first quarter of 2024," said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, he added, "let's not be too churlish as it could be we see the FTSE outperform its rivals in the years to come should investors seek out dividend paying value stocks rather than techy growthy ones."

  The index has in recent weeks been lifted by a weakening of the pound, particularly against the dollar, as markets anticipate cuts to UK interest rates in the coming months thanks to slowing price rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A weaker pound benefits FTSE-listed British multinationals that make big earnings in foreign currencies. Sterling gained against the dollar and euro on Tuesday after falling earlier in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets won a lift from news of an improvement to business activity in the eurozone this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street opened higher on a busy week on the corporate front, with investors keenly awaiting first-quarter earnings from Elon Musk's Tesla later in the day.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation rate slightly rose in March, with the Composite Consumer Price Index up two percent on a year earlier.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compared to the 1.9 percent inflation rate in the previous two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department showed that underlying inflation, stripping out short-term relief measures, was also up marginally in March, at one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcohol and tobacco prices surged nearly 18 percent year-on-year, while meals out and takeaways were up 3.3 percent and housing costs rose 3.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electricity, gas and water prices dropped 8.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the underlying price inflation was “modest” in March, noting that prices of basic foods edged down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay contained in the near term. Domestic costs may face some upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain on a broad downward trend, though heightened geopolitical tensions will bring uncertainties,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first quarter of 2024, overall consumer prices rose 1.9 percent year-on-year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered higher on Monday, shrugging off recent weakness at the start of a heavy week of earnings from technology and industrial companies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The markets are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the tensions in the Middle East didn't escalate," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks tumbled on Friday, in part due to selling ahead of the weekend amid fears of a worsening in the Israel-Iran conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 38,239.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 5,010, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.1 percent to 15,451.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 finished in positive territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's earnings calendar includes results from tech titans such as Amazon and Microsoft, as well as from industrial companies including Chevron and General Motors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla, which also reports this week, fell 3.4 percent following another round of price cuts – the latest sign of intensifying competition among electric vehicle manufacturers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verizon dropped 4.6 percent as analysts cited worries about a soft demand picture, with net broadband subscriber additions slowing compared with the prior quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nike slid 0.4 percent after disclosing to state officials in Oregon that it plans to cut 740 jobs from its headquarters. (AFP)

    'More efforts needed to revive stock market sentiment'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An analyst has said that Hong Kong's stock market performance depends on many factors, including China's economic development. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750024_1_L_20240422200035.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial analysts on Monday said that a pledge by the nation’s securities regulator to offer support in enhancing Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub can provide a short-term boost to market sentiment, but more measures are needed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shares on the Hang Seng Index and Tech Index enjoyed a bump after the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Friday said it would facilitate Hong Kong listings by leading Chinese firms, and loosen rules on stock trading links between exchanges in the SAR and on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the measures, the scope of eligible exchange-traded funds (ETFs) via the links will be widened, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) will be included for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James Wong, chief executive of Cathaysia Securities, said the latest move by Beijing had brought a “positive atmosphere” to local stock markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the securities specialist cautioned that such measures may only help in the near future, and that it may take “many more policies” to really improve sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “All of these [measures] are good. But, for example, the number of ETFs that are allowed is less than 10. I really don't know how much capital flow that 10 ETFs can bring to the Hong Kong market,” he noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that there were only 12 initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the first quarter, and described the figure as “scary”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong expressed the hope that authorities will make it easier for mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia, said that Monday's rally came on the back of a combination of factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The sentiment has already improved over the past two months,” said Wen, noting that while the city’s bourse may be able to see more capital inflow following Beijing’s announcement, the “game changer” lies on fundamental factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It depends on many more factors, including China's economic development and whether the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June or July. These fundamental factors may be more important for foreign or mainland capital - whether they want to come to Hong Kong and buy Hong Kong stocks,” Wen said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq sank more than two percent on Friday following a poor investor response to Netflix earnings that exacerbated worries over next week's deluge of earnings from tech giants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 2.1 percent at 15,282, with Netflix sinking 9.1 percent and artificial intelligence leader Nvidia losing 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 percent to 37,986, and the S&P 500 declined 0.9 percent to 4,967.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netflix reported a profit of US$2.3 billion, topping earnings expectations on a jump in subscribers. The drop appeared to be tied to commentary about the current quarter which suggested growth was moderating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results come ahead of reports next week from other key tech names, including Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The way Netflix has responded has created some consternation about the mega stocks' ability to live up to expectations," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, who cited downcast comments from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company earlier in the week as a driver of Friday's poor showing by chip stocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stocks have had a rough week due in part to unease over the Middle East and shifting expectations on US monetary policy, with traders betting the US central bank will delay cutting interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other companies reporting results, American Express jumped 6.2 percent after reporting a 34 percent increase in quarterly profits to US$2.4 billion.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla is recalling 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles because of a defect that can cause unintentional vehicle acceleration, increasing crash risk, according to a US notice posted this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tesla notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on April 17 of the condition in which the accelerator pedal may become trapped on the Cybertruck, Elon Musk's futuristic take on the American pickup truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the accelerator pedal becomes trapped, "the performance and operation of the pedal will be affected, which may increase the risk of a collision," Tesla said in the notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla said it was not aware of any collisions or injuries related to the condition. The company will replace or rework the accelerator to address the issue, the company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has championed the Cybertruck, declaring at a launch event last November that "Finally, the future will look like the future!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the vehicle's use of large flat plates of unbent stainless steel poses challenges in manufacturing. Musk has said it will take time to ramp up production, targeting 2025 as the year when output will reach 250,000 a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Tesla announced it would lay off more than 10 percent of its global workforce as it contends with rising competition among electric vehicle producers and slowing demand growth in some markets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 When Vincent Yuan, a resident of Hebei province on the mainland, wanted to get something nice for his wife, he bought a piece of golden gourd jewellery, spending about 28,000 yuan at a local jewellery shop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There was also some strategic thinking behind the 35-year-old general manager’s decision, adding he bought the jewellery because he believes there’s real value to be gained from investing in the precious yellow metal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People like buying stuff which sees its value go up and not down, so if prices keep going up, we’ll of course buy more, and vice versa, if prices go down, then we won’t buy.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gold is like a go-to preference for Chinese people,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His wife, Catrina Xu, 30, is also a fan of gold jewellery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a trip to Hong Kong last year, the only souvenir Xu purchased were gold items — a bracelet from a jewellery store in Tsim Sha Tsui and a necklace when she visited Hong Kong Disneyland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since then, prices have gone up a lot over the past nine months,” she noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were among thousands of mainland Chinese shoppers who see the precious metal as a safe-haven investment to hedge against devaluation amid economic uncertainties as property prices in the country fall and its stock markets slump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since December last year, retail prices for gold from China’s major brands have risen 21 percent to a multi-year high of over 730 yuan (US$100) per gram as of April 12, from the 600 yuan (US$82) range seen in December.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In New York, bullion prices notched another record close on April 15, with the most-active June contract for gold futures settling at US$2,383 per ounce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have been surprised by the strength in gold that we've seen since the start of 2024,” said John Reade, chief market strategist at the World Gold Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bullion veteran said while the Chinese retail buying spree had been a major contributor to the global gold price spikes, other drivers included tensions in the Middle East, and speculative buyers on the Comex futures market in New York, which lifted prices higher over the past six weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Comex is the leading platform for trading futures contracts on precious and base metals, such as gold, silver, and copper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is very much an emerging market phenomena led by China - together with speculative buying [on Comex].”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As has been the incredible purchases by central banks, which has been going on for nearly two years now," Reade said, noting that global central banks had ramped up their gold purchases in 2022 and 2023, to diversify their foreign reserves and reduce their dependency on US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the council's 2023 annual report, about one fourth of global central banks intend to increase their holdings of gold this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The People’s Bank of China, in particular, regained the crown for the largest single gold buyer in 2023, as it reported a total rise of 225 tonnes in its gold reserves over the year, marking its highest level of annual buying since at least 1977.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And all the indications are that it’s continued,” Reade added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American bank Citi on Tuesday forecast that gold is set to reach US$3,000 an ounce over the next six to 18 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lender noted the start of US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts - or a potential recession - would further drive demand for gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another financial giant, Goldman Sachs, last Friday referred to the “unshakeable bull market” in gold and upgraded its price target for the precious metal to US$2,700 an ounce by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would expect gold to benefit from interest rate cuts if and when they materialise in the United States and other important markets. That's likely to help gold performance,” Reade agreed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he cautioned that the metal tends to deliver returns that are only around three percent higher than US inflation in the long term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say US$3,000 an ounce over the next six to 18 months could be quite a stretch from where we are now… That said, there’s certainly the ingredients in place for the strength that we’ve seen in gold to continue for the next year or two,” adding that prices could still be volatile in the short term.

    L'Oreal cautious on China despite sales growth

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cosmetics giant L'Oreal says demand for mass market products in China has outpaced that in the United States. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749535_1_L_20240419024754.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 L'Oreal's chief executive gave a cautious outlook about China, the world's No. 2 beauty market, on Thursday even after the cosmetics maker reported first-quarter sales growth of more than 6 percent for the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter performance in China was well above sector growth of 1 percent, Nicolas Hieronimus told analysts in a call after the French cosmetics giant that owns the Maybelline and Lancome brands released better-than-expected first-quarter sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, he is not banking on any major improvement in consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We plan with, I would say, a China that is not doing fantastic, and we make the most of the opportunities in Europe, in emerging (markets) and gaining share in North America," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And if China accelerates, it will be a positive news on our own expectations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demand for mass market products in China has accelerated during the quarter to a greater extent than in the United States, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The make-up market has slowed the most in North America, although fragrance is doing "great", he said in the call. (Reuters)
