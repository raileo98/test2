<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales dropped by 11.5 percent in May compared to the same month last year, extending a losing streak to three months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that sales slid to HK$30.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drop came after a 14.7 percent fall in April and a 7 percent decrease in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government blamed the latest slump on changes in spending patterns of visitors and residents, as well as the strength of the Hong Kong dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said a recent increase in duty-free allowances for mainland visitors should help local retailers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The retail sector may still face some challenges in the near term. However, the Central Government's recently announced measures benefitting Hong Kong, including the further enhanced Individual Visit Scheme and the increase of duty-free allowance for luggage articles for mainland resident visitors, should help stimulate retail businesses," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that the authorities will continue to stimulate the local economy and market sentiment by hosting mega events.

    Nasdaq at fresh record despite higher Treasury yields

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq powered to a fresh record on Monday behind gains by tech giants, shrugging off an increase in US Treasury yields that analysts tied to shifting election expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shares of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft all posted gains of at least two percent, adding to a buoyant 2024 so far for tech companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq jumped 0.8 percent to 17,879.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones advanced 0.1 percent to 39,169, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.3 percent to 5,475.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US bond yields climbed on Monday, a dynamic that typically sees a drag on equities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cresset Capital's Jack Ablin attributed the rise in yields to a bet that Donald Trump will become the next US president, leading to an extension of tax cuts and pushing back Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rates are long and really going up in response to the shift in populism here and abroad, mostly here with the likelihood of Trump becoming president," Ablin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It looks like a higher for longer trade" in terms of US monetary policy, Ablin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A survey of manufacturers from the Institute for Supply Management's pointed to contraction, lagging expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Boeing rose 2.7 percent after announcing a deal to acquire subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems for US$4.7 billion, a move the aviation giant says will boost efforts to improve quality control. Spirit jumped 3.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Large banks rose after announcing a string of dividends and share repurchases late on Friday after passing annual Federal Reserve stress tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JPMorgan Chase gained 1.6 percent, Goldman Sachs won 2.5 percent and Bank of America 0.6 percent. (AFP)

    South Korean factory activity grows

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korea's exports have been growing since October. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759748_1_20240701092022.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's factory activity growth quickened in June to the fastest in 26 months, as new orders jumped on improving global demand, a private-sector survey showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The purchasing managers index (PMI) for manufacturers in Asia's fourth-largest economy, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 52.0 in June, from 51.6 in May, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the highest reading since April 2022, staying above the 50-mark, which separates expansion from contraction, for a second consecutive month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another strong month of data provides further evidence that global industrial activity and trade are picking up," said Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Viewed as a bellwether for exports due to its integration in supply chains for key intermediate goods like batteries and semiconductors, South Korean manufacturing output and orders often provide leading signals for trends more broadly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New orders expanded at the quickest rate since February 2022 on stronger demand both at home and abroad, with those from overseas increasing the most in five months, sub-indexes showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asian countries including China, Vietnam and Japan, as well as other regions such as North America and Europe were cited in the survey as markets that yielded sales growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's exports, which have been growing since October led by demand for computer chips and from the United States, are recovering towards record-high levels, the finance minister said last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Output rose for a third straight month in June but at a slower rate than the month before. Stocks of finished goods were depleted by the most in nearly three years and backlogs of work rose by the most in almost two years, suggesting that factory capacity was somewhat stretched amid growing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, inflation in input prices accelerated to the fastest in eight months, with companies attributing the rise to unfavourable exchange rate movements and a rise in raw material prices, namely for metals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manufacturers' optimism for the year ahead dropped to the weakest in six months, as concerns grew that domestic market conditions could hinder factory output despite positive sales forecasts. (Reuters)

    Manufacturing contracts for second month in June

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An official factory survey on Sunday showed manufacturing on the mainland contracting for a second month in June. But the non-manufacturing sector - which includes services and construction - continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official purchasing managers' index, or PMI, is a broad survey of sentiment among factory owners. It came in at 49.5 for June and, although the figure was unchanged from May, a number below the 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI fell to 50.5 from 51.1 in May. The figure, which is the lowest since December, suggests consumers are still cautious, even as the sector grows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts now expect Beijing to roll out more policy support measures in the short term, while a government pledge to boost fiscal stimulus is seen helping kick domestic consumption into a higher gear.

    Police raid offices of Thales in three countries

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759642_1_20240630100527.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French defence group Thales faced fresh questions Saturday after police in three countries searched its offices this week as part of two separate corruption investigations, a judicial source told AFP.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers in France, the Netherlands and Spain carried out the searches between Wednesday and Friday, said the source, confirming a report from French broadcaster BFMTV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police searches were triggered by two separate investigations, the source added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first, opened at the end of 2016, into suspected corruption of a foreign official, criminal association and money laundering involved the sale of submarines and the construction of naval base in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second, opened in June 2023, concerned similar offences linked to the sale of military and civilian equipment abroad, the source added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thales confirms that the searches have taken place," the company told AFP Saturday. "The group is cooperating with the competent authorities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an official visit to Rio de Janeiro in 2008, France's then president Nicolas Sarkozy signed a contract with Brazil for the sale of four Scorpene-class submarines for 5.2 billion euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessels incorporated parts supplied by Thales and three of the submarines have already been delivered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second element of the deal was the construction of a naval base and a submarine construction site at Itaguai, which was inaugurated in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second investigation opened in June 2023, said the judicial source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This case is a collaboration by investigators in France, the Netherlands and Spain, as well as official from Eurojust, the European Union agency for criminal justice cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales, in its response to AFP Saturday evening, stressed that it "strictly conforms to national and international regulations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company had developed and implemented a programme designed to ensure it met the highest industry standards, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales has previously been investigated for alleged corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Paris investigating magistrate is due to decide shortly whether to follow the recommendations of the prosecutor at the financial crimes office and put a subsidiary of Thales on trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DCNI, part of the group's naval wing, is under investigation over the sale of submarines to Malaysia in 2002.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it emerged in May 2023 that financial prosecutors had also opened a preliminary investigation into how Thales won a contract to refit India's Mirage-2000 fighter jets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thales has denied any wrongdoing in the affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another investigation, opened in December 2020, is looking at the transfer of a former Thales employee to a key post at the United Nations, one of the defence company's clients. (AFP)

    Buffett donates US$5bn of Berkshire stock

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The latest donation, announced on Friday, included about 13 million Berkshire Class B shares. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759548_1_20240629095627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Warren Buffett donated another US$5.3 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities, his biggest annual donation since he began making them in 2006.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Buffett's donation boosted his overall giving to the charities to about US$57 billion, including to the family charities in the last two Novembers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest donation, announced on Friday, included about 13 million Berkshire Class B shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett donated 9.93 million shares to the Gates Foundation, and has donated more than US$43 billion of Berkshire shares there overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also donated 993,035 shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, and 695,122 shares to each of three charities led by his children Howard, Susan and Peter: the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the Sherwood Foundation and the NoVo Foundation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett, 93, plans to give away more than 99% of the fortune he built at Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, which he has run since 1965, with his children serving as executors of his will.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berkshire is an approximately $880 billion conglomerate that owns dozens of businesses including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance, and stocks such as Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett still owns 14.5 percent of Berkshire's outstanding shares, a Friday regulatory filing shows, despite having given away more than half of his stock since 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His US$128.4 billion fortune makes him the world's 10th-richest person, according to Forbes magazine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Buffett said he was worth about US$44 billion when the donations began, but that the benefits of compounding, "simple and generally sound capital deployment" at Berkshire, and the "American tailwind" produced his current wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buffett, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates also pioneered the Giving Pledge, in which 245 people like OpenAI's Sam Altman, Michael Bloomberg, Carl Icahn, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg committed at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation works in reproductive health. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation works to alleviate hunger, mitigate conflicts including in Ukraine, and improve public safety. The Sherwood Foundation supports Nebraska nonprofits, and the NoVo Foundation has initiatives focused on girls and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's filing suggests based on Buffett's holdings that Berkshire has repurchased little or none of its own stock since April 19. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city's government-owned investment vehicle aims to forge a more competitive tech-innovation ecosystem in the SAR, as he highlighted its differences with Singapore's sovereign investment arm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has been considered by some as a local version of Temasek in Singapore, Chan said the two bodies are “completely different” in an interview marking two years of the current administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s like comparing apples and oranges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two goals of the HKIC are to generate appropriate financial returns, and to help boost the innovation and technology industries and create a local ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Other than conducting its own investments, a more important [function of the firm] is that it will serve as a guide for other long-term and sovereign wealth funds and to invest in certain sectors together... to create a domino effect and attract HK$100 billion, or HK$200 billion or even HK$300 billion,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the government investment vehicle, which was set up two years ago and manages some HK$62 billion in assets, is still operating at an initial stage with only two deals signed so far, and authorities will reveal more details regarding projects with the release of its yearly report later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKIC signed deals with tech firms SmartMore and BioMap InnoHub earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the local property market, Chan said it remains stable despite a drop in prices in May, snapping a two-month increase following the removal of all cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes it’s difficult to avoid fluctuations in the residential property prices because they're affected by multiple factors, including interest rates as well as supply and demand. They're also affected by how people perceive the outlook of the property market and the city’s economic situation, job market, etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe the most important thing for the government is to maintain a healthy development of the property market, in other words, not to have major fluctuations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary added the government will keep ramping up land supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also expressed confidence towards the SAR economy in the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the economy was in its recovery stage in the first six months of 2024 and was still facing challenges, a series of mega events in the next six months will further boost local economic activity.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished mostly flat on Thursday as investors awaited new inflation data. The Nasdaq managed to slightly gain as economic data revealed a sustained slowdown, raising investors' hopes for rate reductions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The market is in a bit of a holding pattern here for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) because there haven't been a lot of big catalysts," said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird, about the release of the monthly PCE price index – the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge – on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Data showed new orders for key US-manufactured capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, while core durable goods orders fell 0.1 percent versus forecasts for a 0.2 percent rise, boosting investor beliefs that a weaker economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekly jobless claims fell to 233,000, missing expectations of 236,000. Furthermore, a final print showed that US economic growth increased more than anticipated in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Benchmark 10- and 2-year yields, which move inversely to prices, dropped after the data showed a continued but moderated slowdown in economic activity, while the 7-year yields edged lower after a US$44 billion auction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacap stocks, such as Alphabet and Meta Platforms, firmed as US Treasury yields slipped. Amazon.com rose after hitting US$2 trillion in market value for the first time on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.11 percent to 39,164. The S&P 500 gained 0.07 percent to end at 5,482, while the Nasdaq gained 0.30 percent to 17,859.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A top government official has urged enterprises to align their practices in sustainability disclosure with international standards, as part of efforts to boost the city's sustainable financial development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a climate action summit on Thursday, Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk noted that the government issued a vision statement in March and aims to be among the first jurisdictions to align disclosures with benchmarks published by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To deepen Hong Kong's green and sustainable finance development, enterprises must align their practices in sustainability disclosure with international standards," Cheuk said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our target is to launch a roadmap on the appropriate adoption of the ISSB standards in Hong Kong within this year, so as to provide a transparent and well-defined pathway on sustainability reporting for businesses, as well as giving sufficient time for them to make preparations and develop readiness for the pragmatic implementation of the Hong Kong standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit, hosted by the World Green Organisation, focused on issues such as environmental, social and governance, carbon neutrality, and sustainable development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  William Yu, the group's founder and chief executive officer, stressed the importance of addressing climate change, saying people should not underestimate the role of green finance and technology in decarbonisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The impact of climate change and natural disasters is becoming increasingly visible, with damaging consequences on our environment, economies, and communities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, extreme weather incidents, and biodiversity loss are stark reminders of the urgency of this action. Now we stand at a crucial juncture where every decision we make now will shape the future of our planet for generations to come."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu said there more than 7,000 climatic disasters were reported from 2010 to 2020, a 35 percent rise compared to the previous decade. Such disasters cost the lives of hundreds of thousands and affected the lives of billions, he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher after a choppy session on Wednesday that saw big moves in some individual stocks after corporate earnings, with FedEx rising and General Mills tumbling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shipping giant FedEx surged 15.5 percent after reporting earnings that topped estimates following job cuts and other measures to cull expenses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But General Mills slid 4.6 percent as it reported a six percent drop in quarterly sales while price inflation hits demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up less than 0.1 percent at 39,127.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 5,477, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.5 percent to 17,805.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was not a heavy input day in terms of new news," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, who pointed to Friday's PCE pricing data as the week's most anticipated report owing to its implications for the Federal Reserve.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Rivian Automotive soared more than 12 percent after announcing that Volkswagen would invest up to US$5 billion in the electric vehicle maker, establishing a joint venture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whirlpool jumped 17.1 percent following a Reuters report that German engineering company Robert Bosch is weighing a takeover bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderna fell 11 percent following clinical testing showing that the efficacy of the company's RSV vaccine fell sharply after the first year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The yen, weakened by the Japanese government's easy monetary policy, hit a 38-year low against the US dollar on Wednesday, sparking speculation about a new intervention by authorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stocks were mostly lower despite a tech rebound that helped the Nasdaq edge into positive territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yen slid as far as 160.75 to the greenback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite sliding through the 160 level, there was no indication that authorities had intervened to support the yen, said market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This being the case, it's possible that traders work to push the yen lower in a renewed attempt to test the resolve of the Japanese authorities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's top currency official has said authorities were ready to act 24 hours a day if the unit fell too far, but some investors suspect that the new trigger may be 165 yen to the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Billions were pumped in to support the yen after it hit a 34-year low of 160.17 in late April, but with limited effect. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell by 1.2 percent in May, according to official data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drop followed two consecutive months of increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices in May were 12.7 percent lower than the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed a one percent increase in rental prices, which reached a four-and-a-half year high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the first time home prices have reported a decrease since Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech in late February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, the director of real estate consultancy Knight Frank, said the effects of the end of the "spicy" measures have now worn off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There seems to be no positive factors apart from the cooling measures news. Because currently the home prices are still being impacted by two negative factors," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first one is the high interest rate environment and the second one is the ample supply for new units. As long as these two factors continue to impact the market, it will stop the home prices from rebounding quickly."

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Tuesday, as Nvidia reversed a recent decline to finish the day almost seven percent higher, pushing up the Nasdaq.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed down 0.8 percent at 39,112, while the S&P 500 closed 0.4 percent higher at 5,469.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq was the top performing major index on Wall Street, closing up 1.3 percent at 17,717.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors also digested consumer confidence data published on Tuesday, which showed that consumers in the United States have become slightly less optimistic about the state of the world's largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next major data release comes on Friday, when the Fed's favoured inflation gauge is published, with economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal expecting a slight decline in the annual rate at which prices are rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically all eyes are on the inflation," said Spartan Capital Securities chief economist Peter Cardillo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual stocks, Nvidia surged 6.8 percent, reversing course after a disappointing run, while cruise ship companies Carnival and Norwegian rose by 8.7 percent and 5.1 percent respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of the table, the swimming pool supply company Pool Corp saw its share price fall by eight percent after slashing its guidance for the year. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About half of Hong Kong's financial institutions are using virtual assets in their business operations, according to a report released on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) -- an affiliate of the Monetary Authority -- surveyed 59 entities, including those from the banking, insurance and asset management sectors between May and July last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey revealed that 53 percent of firms were using virtual assets, while 85 percent expected virtual assets to be part of their core business operations in the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the institute's head, Giorgio Valente, said financial institutions are cautious about the application of virtual assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the moment, because people are trying to understand how to maximise the benefits, while learning about its vulnerabilities, these elements obviously would actually impact the effective adoption. But going forward, we expect the situation eventually may improve," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente added that Hong Kong remained attractive as a virtual assets hub, as the SAR had a well-defined regulatory framework and robust financial infrastructure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mixed on Monday, with industrial companies lifting the Dow and a retreat by some of the hottest tech names weighing on the Nasdaq.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts described the market as in a wait-and-see mode ahead of major news events this week, including a US presidential debate and key US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 39,411.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.3 percent to 5,447, while the Nasdaq tumbled 1.1 percent to 17,496.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's some natural rotation just given how massive the outperformance between the big tech stocks and the artificial intelligence momentum plays has been relative to the broader market," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's just a kind of a natural consolidation and rotation trade taking place there."

  Ahead of the Thursday night debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump and Friday's report on personal consumption pricing, the calendar includes earnings from FedEx and consumer confidence data.

  AI star Nvidia, which has risen spectacularly over the last year to attain a market capitalisation above US$3 trillion, fell 6.7 percent in the stock's third straight down day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other big AI-linked equities including Qualcomm, Broadcom and Arm Holdings also fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Target rose 2.4 percent after announcing a partnership with global commerce platform Shopify intended to boost Target Plus, the big box store's digital marketplace. Shopify fell 1.1 percent. (AFP)

    EU accuses Apple of breaking bloc's new digital rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Under the new Digital Markets Act, the European Commission has the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758864_1_20240625015852.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple risks billions of euros in fines after the European Union on Monday accused the iPhone maker of violating the bloc's landmark digital rules by hindering competition on its App Store.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The European Commission informed Apple in a "preliminary view" that the "App Store rules... prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finding opens a new front in the increasingly bitter fight between the US tech giant and Brussels over the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), and may force changes to the way the App Store operates in the bloc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Apple said it would delay rolling out recently announced AI features in Europe because of "regulatory uncertainties" linked to the DMA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sweeping law seeks to rein in the world's biggest tech firms, including Apple, by forcing them to open up to competition in the 27-country EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for Apple, the new rules are a significant challenge to its walled garden and it has openly accused the DMA of creating greater privacy and security risks for users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time the commission has levelled a formal accusation against a tech firm under the new rules, after opening the first DMA probes into Apple, Google and Meta in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple said on Monday that it has made "a number of changes" to comply with the rules in response to feedback from developers and the EU regulator over the past months, and would "continue to listen and engage with the European Commission."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple can now access the commission's investigation file and reply to the findings. If Apple falls in line with EU rules, it can avoid a fine and Brussels believes it will give European users easier access to cheaper offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the commission's view is confirmed, it would adopt a "non-compliance decision" by late March 2025 – opening the way to fines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new law, the commission has the power to impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company's total global turnover. This can rise to up to 20 percent for repeat offenders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple also faces daily penalties of up to five per cent of its average daily worldwide turnover if found to be non-compliant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion (358 billion euros).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU also has the right to break up companies, but only as a last resort. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-owned investment vehicle has struck a deal with a biotechnology firm started by the founder of Chinese internet giant Baidu, the second such strategic partnership announced in just two weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Cooperation (HKIC) on Monday signed a cooperation deal with BioMap, which specialises in life science.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, co-founded by Robin Li who also started Baidu, is the second company the HKIC has partnered with. Earlier this month, the investment vehicle signed another agreement with SmartMore, a technology company specialising in artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had a solid foundation in both artificial intelligence and life science, and he was confident more tech companies would come to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a complete funding chain, ranging from a rich private equity and venture capital ecosystem to a deep and wide listing platform," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that more tech companies will choose Hong Kong as their base for [research and development] and international cooperation as well as a platform to explore the broader Asian and global market. And of course, we welcome companies such as BioMap to list on our stock exchange, using our world-class fundraising platform to grow bigger and stronger."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clara Chan, the chief executive officer of HKIC, said the strategic partnerships would focus on the application of artificial intelligence, which had become "the backbone technology for future creation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will not only invest in BioMap, but also lead the current financing round. Leading the round means that the HKIC is setting the parameters and terms of this round for other investors to follow," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the partnership, the tech firm will set up its international innovation centre called BioMap InnoHub, which aims to support more than 50 early-stage research and development projects in the life sciences.

    Nvidia signs deal to use its AI across the Middle East

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Clients of Ooredoo's data centres in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait and the Maldives will get access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing tech. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758703_1_20240623214218.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia has signed a deal to deploy its artificial intelligence technology at data centres owned by Qatari telecoms group Ooredoo in five Middle Eastern countries, said Ooredoo's CEO.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agreement marks Nvidia's first large-scale launch in a region to which Washington has curbed the export of sophisticated US chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will make Ooredoo the first company in the region able to give clients of its data centres in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait and the Maldives direct access to Nvidia's AI and graphics processing technology, Ooredoo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Providing the technology will allow Ooredoo to better help its customers deploy generative AI applications, Nvidia's senior vice president of telecom Ronnie Vasishta said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our b2b clients, thanks to this agreement, will have access to services that probably their competitors (won't) for another 18 to 24 months," Ooredoo's CEO Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo said in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which was signed on the sidelines of the TM Forum in Copenhagen on June 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo also would not disclose exactly what type of Nvidia technology it will be installing in its data centres, saying that it depends on availability and customer demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington allows the export of some Nvidia technology to the Middle East, but curbs exports of the company's most sophisticated chips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo is investing US$1 billion to boost its regional data centre capacity by 20-25 additional megawatts on top of the 40 megawatts it currently has, and plans to almost triple that by the end of the decade, Fakhroo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has carved out its data centres into a separate company following a similar move last year to create the Middle East's largest tower company in a deal with Kuwait's Zain and Dubai's TASC Towers Holding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ooredoo also has plans to carve out its undersea cables and fibre network into a separate entity, Fakhroo said. (Reuters)

    S&amp;P, Nasdaq down as Nvidia falls back for second day

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell slightly overnight after Nvidia shares dropped for a second day, dragging down the technology sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Technology was the biggest loser among the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, weighed by Nvidia, while communication services led the gain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's Nvidia's game, and the rest of us are just pretending to be here,” said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management in Philadelphia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically all the activity is now concentrated in Nvidia call options," he added. "Seven million option contracts Nvidia have traded. That's something in the neighborhood of three or four times the quantity of contract volume that would have traded for the market in total five years ago."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose a tenth of a percent, to 39,162. The S&P 500 lost a fifth of a percent, to end at 5,468, while the Nasdaq lost a fifth of a percent, to 17,693.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of megacaps Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple rose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We've had a very strong run, especially in the S&P over the last couple weeks. So not surprised to see things kind of take a pause and settle down,” Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's trading could be more volatile than usual due to triple witching, the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index options, and stock index futures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  U.S. business activity reached a 26-month high in June amid a rebound in employment, while easing price pressures suggested the recent inflation slowdown may continue. (Reuters)

    Deloitte lowers Hong Kong's IPO forecast by 40 percent

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Edward Au (centre) says more mainland companies would list in Hong Kong after the US Federal Reserve cuts its interest rates. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758466_1_20240621170819.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Accounting firm Deloitte on Friday said it had slashed its projections for Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) fundraising by up to 40 percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deloitte now expects to see 80 new listings to generate between HK$60 billion and HK$80 billion of proceeds, down from its previous estimate of HK$100 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southern Region Managing Partner of Deloitte China, Edward Au, attributed the downgrade in expectations to the uncertainty surrounding the US interest rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut timing will affect the flow of funds into Hong Kong, because I think definitely investors would wait, regarding the risk and return,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They actually want to invest in more tangible [assets], and companies with concrete profits or paths to profit.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the lowering of Deloitte's forecast, Au expected that Hong Kong would be among the top five global IPO venues in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ultimately, Au was optimistic that more mainland companies would list in Hong Kong in the second half of the year, as their valuations would rise if the US Federal Reserve reduced its rates, as some have projected, resulting in an appreciation of the renminbi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another accountancy giant, KPMG, which released its revised projections on Tuesday, expected that IPO fundraising in Hong Kong would generate at most HK$60 billion in revenue in 2024.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in May year-on-year, up slightly from the 1.1 percent increase recorded in April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Census and Statistics Department figures released on Friday showed there was a 20.1 percent increase in the price of alcoholic drinks and tobacco, a 3 percent rise in the price of meals out and takeaways, and a 2.3 percent increase in transport costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said inflation should remain contained in the near future, but domestic cost pressures may increase as the local economy continues to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "External price pressures should continue to stay on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties. The government will continue to monitor the situation," the spokesperson said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said Friday that the European Union was to blame for escalating trade frictions with China, which could lead to a "trade war".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Responsibility lies entirely with the EU side," a ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hoped the EU would meet it halfway, handle differences through dialogue and avoid escalating trade friction or allowing it to get out of control, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the European Commission proposed tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on electric vehicle imports from China despite Beijing's protest, plunging trade ties to a new low and risking punitive action from the world's second-largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry statement was published just before the arrival of German Economy Minister Robert Habeck in Beijing, where he was expected to explain to Chinese officials the recent tariff announcement while allaying the risk of retaliation that could harm German businesses.

    Bankruptcy petitions rise to two-year high in May

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Data from the Official Receiver’s Office showed the number of bankruptcy petitions in the city in May was the highest since April 2022. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758414_1_20240621105258.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official data released on Friday showed the number of bankruptcy petitions in Hong Kong had risen to the highest level in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to figures by the Official Receiver’s Office, there were 871 bankruptcy petitions in May, 17 percent higher on a monthly basis, and 35 percent higher from a year ago, while marking the highest number since April 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of bankruptcy orders by the court, however, significantly dropped last month, standing at 624.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was nearly 27 percent less compared with April when it hit a three-year high, and nine percent lower year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office also received 61 compulsory winding-up petitions in May, eight percent lower than April, but 85 percent higher from last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also 43 winding-up orders by the court last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Simon Lee, honorary fellow at Chinese University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Business, said that higher borrowing costs were a factor in the latest surge in bankruptcies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The high interest rates have been persisting for quite a long time, the economy still remains weak for some sectors,” Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And for those who didn't manage their debts well when they purchased their residential accommodations, I think they experienced all the hardship.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The economics professor also noted that an overall downward trend in the city’s property prices had also added to the cashflow woes of both individuals and businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Usually people create wealth from the properties, but now that the property prices have dropped about 16 percent in the past two years, and the industry remains weak.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If the properties’ values are depreciating, for property owners, no matter if they sell the properties or use the properties as a guarantee [to secure bank loans], their cash flow status will remain weak, and this will increase the chance of having bankruptcies,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, meanwhile, said via social media that the latest figures “cannot accurately reflect the city's economic situation”, as the monthly data are volatile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s economy grew 2.7 percent in the first quarter, while the jobless rate hovered at around three percent with moderate inflation, the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also estimated the city would welcome a total of 46 million visitors this year, which would be 35 percent more compared with last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government will keep promoting the mega-event economy and improve consumption sentiment...to further improve the city’s competitiveness.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee agreed the latest bankruptcy indicators alone could not reflect the city’s overall economic recovery, but called on authorities to do more to help small-and-medium-sized businesses survive, such as to further implement measures for them to defer their principal payments on corporate loans and mortgages.

 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday, as market bellwether Nvidia retreated from earlier gains, while investors evaluated recent economic data and commentary from Federal Reserve officials to determine the timing of interest-rate cuts this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the S&P 500 hit the crucial 5,500-point mark for the first time ever, a year-end target multiple brokerages had forecast. Nasdaq ended a seven-session streak of record closing highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares of Nvidia dropped 3.54 percent after rising earlier in the session. The chipmaker dethroned Microsoft on Tuesday to become the most valuable public company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dell and Super Micro Computer also declined 0.42 percent and 0.26 percent respectively after an initial increase, following news that they received server orders for Elon Musk's AI startup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined last week, but the latest data showed that the overall number of people on benefits rolls reached the highest level since January, indicating that the US job market continues to cool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another set of data showed US single-family homebuilding fell in May amid continued high mortgage rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The news that we got today was just another negative weakness in the economy”, said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta. “In the employment report, you're getting those (unemployment) claims that are not terrible, but it's.. getting into a territory that's not low necessarily anymore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said it would take a year or two to get inflation back to 2 percent, as wage growth might still be too high, spurring worries of interest rates staying elevated for longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.77 percent, to 39,135, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 percent, to 5,473 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.79 percent, to 17,722.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Shanghai Regional Centre was officially opened on Wednesday. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758146_1_20240619164954.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday announced it had opened a new regional centre in Shanghai to further strengthen its engagement and partnership in the Asia-Pacific region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The opening was announced on the first day of the two-day annual Lujiazui financial forum in the mainland’s financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the IMF said the new centre “will serve as a hub to promote research that can inform policies in areas of interest to emerging market and middle-income countries”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will help deepen the IMF’s dialogue with member countries and other stakeholders in the region, including international financial institutions, academics, think-tanks, CSOs, and the private sector,” the statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, it said the new establishment would facilitate targeted capacity-building in the region, including via peer-to-peer learning, in collaboration with the China IMF Capacity Development Centre (CICDC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also expressed gratitude to China’s central bank for its generous financial support to its Shanghai Regional Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre’s launch ceremony, Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said he welcomed the new establishment in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe the Shanghai Regional Centre will deepen cooperation between the IMF and China, enhance macroeconomic policy exchange and coordination among the Asia Pacific countries, and support regional and global financial stability,” Pan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pan, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at the same event that the Shanghai centre “will deepen understanding of perspectives from member countries, and foster international economic cooperation”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening of the new centre came after the IMF earlier upgraded its estimate for China’s economic growth for this year from 4.6 percent to five percent last month, putting its projections in line with Beijing’s full-year growth estimate at around five percent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will unveil eight measures to reform its five-year-old Nasdaq-style sci-tech board under the Shanghai Stock Exchange to promote the nation's technology and innovation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering a keynote speech at the annual Lujiazui financial forum in Shanghai, Wu Qing, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said reforms of the Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR Market, will also better facilitate the development of new quality productive forces, called for by President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the reforms will cover arrangements related to share offerings, underwriting and mergers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu said technology innovation is at the core of developing new quality productive forces, and long-term investments, or patient capital, shall be further expanded to support the technology and innovation enterprises in the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the CSRC will further ramp up supervision and law enforcement in areas such as high-frequency quantitative trading to protect investors, and will clamp down on financial fraud of listed firms by encouraging whistleblowers to report issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dubbed the “broker butcher”, Wu, who was appointed to chair the commission in February, is known for his forceful measures, including posing curbs on new share offerings and strict punishment for fraudulent listings and accounting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since his appointment, Chinese stocks have seen a rebound, following a three-year decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong stock markets advanced on Wednesday in early trade following his announcements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Pan Gongsheng, the Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said at the same forum that the country’s central bank is studying the implementation of government bond trading, along with the finance ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pan noted that such sovereign bond trading will be implemented via a gradual process, and that the pace of sovereign bond sales, term structure, and the custody system will also need to be studied and optimised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed that such practices cannot be equated to quantitative easing, and said they are tools for managing liquidity and injecting base money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There will be both buying and selling [of the sovereign bonds], and it will be combined with other tools to create an accommodative liquidity environment,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank chief also suggested that there is more room to ease monetary policy as other economies are pivoting to cut interest rates this year.

  The rise in the local bourse tracked gains across the region as Asian shares rose to their highest level in three weeks at the start of trading on Wednesday, boosted by a rally in tech stocks while the dollar wobbled after soft US retail sales data reinforced expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates later this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 reaching a new record on a day that Nvidia edged ahead of Microsoft to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chip company, which has enjoyed a monumental ascent over the last 18 months amid enthusiasm over generative AI, closed 3.5 percent higher, giving it a market capitalisation of about US$3.3 trillion, slightly ahead of the tech giants Microsoft and Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were kind of waiting for this moment, actually, for quite some time," said Angelo Zino from the financial intelligence firm CFRA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The semiconductor industry is now the biggest sub-industry in the S&P 500," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three major indices rose on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 rising 0.3 percent to reach a new all-time high of 5,487.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.2 percent to 38,834, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq finished up less than 0.1 percent at 17,862.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid the ongoing enthusiasm for Nvidia, other chip companies saw gains on Tuesday, including Qualcomm and Micron, which closed up 2.2 percent and 3.8 percent respectively. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia edged ahead of other tech companies on Tuesday to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in the latest sign of the might of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chip company, which has enjoyed a monumental ascent over the last 18 months amid enthusiasm over generative AI, jumped 3.4 percent near 1:25 pm (1725 GMT), giving it a market capitalisation of about US$3.3 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft and Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The California-based company, which is led by Jensen Huang, has seen profits soar due to torrid demand for its powerful GPU chips, which have set the industry's pace in pushing new advances in AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May, Nvidia reported a net profit of US$14.9 billion, while its revenue of US$26 billion was almost four times what it took in during the same fiscal quarter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe over the next year the race to US$4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft," said a note earlier this week from Wedbush Securities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small and medium-sized brokers have enough time and support to get themselves ready, officials said on Tuesday, as the financial market is set to remain in operation under severe weather conditions from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The securities and derivatives markets, including northbound and southbound trading, will continue operating during severe weather conditions, while banks and securities dealers will provide electronic services but shut down their physical outlets, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brokers are required to set up a remote office and adopt digital trading by the implementation date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For those failing to meet the requirements, they can assign a small number of staff to return to their workplaces in times of typhoons and heavy rain, in accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said there’s a “holistic package” of support for brokers, especially smaller-sized firms, to put arrangements for remote working in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Technically we have the solutions ready in the market and the HKEx has already set out in the consultation document conclusions that they will provide necessary support in order to connect the potential service providers to the participants if they are needed,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Incentives are being given to the participants to upgrade themselves because for those that cannot do that before the end of September, if they need more time, we will support them through shouldering the relevant clearing responsibilities. At the same time, the regulators will pragmatically deal with their relevant compliance issues if they cannot during that period move everything online."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial services chief said people can draw on the experience of remote working during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Working from home or using technology or online, whatever systems are available to do all the arrangements, it's not something new to the market, and especially during Covid times when already certain members of our financial community are already doing that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what we are proposing here is not drastic change but rather incremental change which is contingent on experience that we get before.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that tests will be conducted in August to check market readiness, but noting that the official implementation will not be delayed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial industry on Tuesday welcomed the government's move to keep the local stock market open during typhoons and heavy rain storms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's stock market will continue trading under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robert Lee, who represents the financial services sector, said the new arrangement could enhance Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Lee, who is also a director of the Hong Kong Securities Association, called on authorities to offer more support to small and medium-sized financial institutions to help them adapt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The industry had been expecting it for quite some time now, especially it being mentioned in the Policy Address as well as the Budget. I think international firms and larger scale firms fully support this initiative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for some of the SMEs, or the local brokers, I would encourage the SAR government as well as HKEX to provide more assistance to them as they adapt to the new measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan said the industry now had sufficient time to prepare to operate in severe weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the right time to implement such kind of arrangement because during the last few years (of the) epidemic situation, a number of electronic trading systems and business solutions have been upgraded," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because the implementation time will be this September, now we have sufficient time for us to effectively assist those smaller-scale firms to smoothly transition to the new arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Funds Association and accounting firm KPMG welcomed the new arrangement, saying it would put Hong Kong's bourse in line with other major markets on the mainland and overseas.

    KPMG downgrades local IPO outlook

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Accountancy giant KPMG on Tuesday said it has downgraded its expectations for Hong Kong's initial public offering (IPO) market this year, citing a global decline in dealmaking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  KPMG now expects to see up to 80 companies listing, raising HK$60 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, the accountancy firm had projected 90 listings, with revenue of HK$100 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, KPMG's Head of New Economy and Life Sciences Irene Chu said regional and global uncertainty is weighing on valuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no shortage of companies that want to apply for an IPO... A lot of the time, it is about how attractive they are to investors," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is not as much about the local economic condition, it actually has a lot to do with the regional and global situation when it comes to interest rates and economic performance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, Hong Kong saw 27 IPOs which raised HK$12 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was down from 31 listings with revenue of HK$18 billion in the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KPMG said it expects Hong Kong will see more IPOs in the second half of the year thanks to the loosening of listing rules as well as supportive measures from the nation's market regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing earlier introduced the Chapter 18C listing regime, which makes it easier for specialist technology firms to list in the city. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, meanwhile, rolled out five measures to strengthen Hong Kong's status as a financial centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Investors will still be able to trade in the city's financial market under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee made the announcement ahead of his weekly Executive Council meeting, saying Hong Kong has no valid reason to stop the financial market operating during severe weather conditions, when other major financial hubs are able to continue trading in such circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other securities markets around the world such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, they maintain trading even under severe weather conditions. Hong Kong is the only exception. Hong Kong is an international financial centre and there is no reason for us not to align with international standards," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the move would consolidate the competitiveness of HKEx and raise Hong Kong's role as a trading corridor with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing a public consultation exercise carried out by HKEx, Lee said about 90 percent of brokerages and banks support keeping the financial market open under severe weather conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the implementation date in late September will give the trade enough time to prepare, and the relevant authorities will offer support to small brokerages to cope with the change.

 Wall Street stocks began the week on a strong note, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finishing at records spurred on by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq led the major indices, climbing 1.0 percent to 17,857, a closing record for the sixth straight day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones climbed 0.5 percent to 38,778, while the S&P 500 also finished at an all-time high, rising 0.8 percent to 5,473.

  <br/>
  "It's not a broad rally but it's a rally with the index up for sure," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, who pointed to recent share price gains of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia as a source of momentum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hogan also noted that the outlook for US monetary policy had improved somewhat following last week's US inflation data, which kept alive the chance of interest rate cuts in 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week's calendar includes the release of US retail sales data, as well a Bank of England policy meeting.

  Markets will be closed on Wednesday to mark the Juneteenth National Independence Day. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday said it had launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork and pork by-products from the European Union.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce has opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of relevant pork and pig by-products originating from the European Union," the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation would begin on June 17, the ministry said, and was prompted by a complaint submitted by the China Animal Husbandry Association on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry said the investigation should be completed by June 17, 2025, but could be extended by another six months if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the European Commission's June 12 announcement that it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from July, global food companies have been on high alert for retaliatory tariffs from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities on the mainland had previously dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows improving consumer sentiment, although industrial output lagged expectations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757755_1_20240617113531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales figures in May, a major indicator of consumption sentiment, rose 3.7 percent year on year to 3.92 trillion yuan, accelerating from a 2.3 percent increase in April and marking the quickest rate of growth since February.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newly released data on Monday from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) also showed that retail sales climbed 4.1 percent year on year in the first five months of 2024, to hit 19.52 trillion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected retail sales to grow three percent due to the five-day public holiday earlier in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, industrial output on the mainland lagged expectations with the property sector still weak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial data released by the NBS came in below expectations for a six percent increase, with output rising only 5.6 percent year on year in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded four percent in the first five months of 2024 from the same period a year earlier, versus expectations for a 4.2 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It grew 4.2 percent in the January to April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS also reported that China's raw coal output fell three percent year on year to 1.86 billion tonnes in the first five months of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May alone, the country's raw coal output stood at 380 million tonnes, down 0.8 percent year on year, although the decline was 2.1 percentage points narrower than in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's property market downturn, high local government debt and deflation remained heavy drags on economic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest figures point to an uneven growth pattern that reinforced calls for more fiscal and monetary policy support from the central government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With narrowing interest margins and a weakening currency remaining key constraints limiting Beijing's scope to ease monetary policy, China's central bank left a key policy rate unchanged as expected on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's second-largest economy grew faster than expected at 5.3 percent in the first quarter, but analysts said the government's around five percent annual growth target was ambitious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's exports grew faster than expected in May helped by improved global demand, but growth in imports slowed significantly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tepid demand at home has also kept a lid on consumer prices as confidence remains low in the face of a protracted property sector crisis while new bank lending rebounded less than expected in May. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 edged lower on Friday, ending a four-day run of record closing highs, but gains in Adobe and other technology shares limited the decline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 technology sector rose, with Adobe shares jumping after the company raised its annual revenue forecast on more demand for its artificial intelligence-powered software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors were also digesting economic data to gauge how soon the Federal Reserve might be able to cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index slipped to 65.6 in June, sharply lower than expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Fed policymakers dialed back their projections for three cuts this year to just one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main situation here is we've got an extended market," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York. "You've had a big rally this week, led by big-cap tech. Under the surface, we have a lot of areas acting weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent, to end at 5,432, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.14 percent, to 17,688. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.14 percent, to 38,591.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russell small-cap index fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said he was relieved after data this week showed inflation in May had cooled, but he would still like to see "more months" of similar data before cutting interest rates.

    Rebound in Chinese lending less than expected in May

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New lending by Chinese banks was not as strong as expected in May. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757494_1_20240614211921.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 New bank lending in China rebounded far less than expected in May, and some key money gauges hit record lows, suggesting the world's second-largest economy continued to face headwinds even as the central bank seeks to bolster confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chinese banks issued 950 billion yuan in new loans last month, compared to 730 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters' calculations based on the latest data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) released on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted loans would rise to 1.255 trillion yuan but would still be below the 1.36 trillion yuan issued in May last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China’s credit extension came in lower than expected in May, suggesting that the deleveraging in the households continues," said Zhou Hao, chief economist at Guotai Junan International.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhou said China's central bank may be reluctant to cut interest rates any time soon, as that could lead to further depreciation of the yuan as the US Federal Reserve seems in no hurry to start cutting its rates, which is buoying the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Balancing all the factors, we think that the PBOC would refrain from policy rate cuts for now but provide more targeted support via relending programmes over the foreseeable future," he said. (Reuters)
