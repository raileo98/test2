<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia pounded Ukraine's capital of Kyiv with missiles on Monday, while officials said falling debris from the downed weapons injured at least two people, sparking fires and damaging homes and infrastructure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's air defence units destroyed more than 10 cruise missiles and nearly 10 ballistic missiles, the city's military administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air raid alerts went out across Ukraine for nearly two hours before the air force declared the skies clear. Neighbouring NATO member Poland activated Polish and allied aircraft to keep its airspace safe during the attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boiler house at a Kyiv water plant was partially damaged as was the entrance to a metro station doubling as a bomb shelter in the Svyatoshynksyi district, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app, though the station still operates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The district is home to a cluster of universities and schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency services also went to the districts of Svyatoshynksyi, Holosiivskyi, and Solomyanskyi, where debris fell from destroyed missiles, Klitschko added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solomyanskyi is home to a major train station and Kyiv's main airport. The historic neighbourhood of Svyatoshynksyi is on the city's western edge, while Holosiivskyi is in its southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack came exactly a week after Moscow launched more than 200 missiles and drones on Ukraine, killing seven people and striking energy facilities nationwide in what Kyiv called the war's "most massive" attack. (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768686_1_20240902110322.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A far-right party won a state election for the first time in post-World War II Germany on Sunday and looked set to finish a very close second to mainstream conservatives in a second vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A new party founded by a prominent leftist also made a strong impact, while the parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s unpopular national government obtained extremely weak results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 32.8 percent of the vote in Thuringia in the country's east — well ahead of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the main national opposition party, with 23.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Saxony, projections put support for the CDU, which has led the state since German reunification in 1990, at 31.9 percent and AfD on 30.6-30.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AfD made substantial gains in Thuringia and smaller ones in Saxony compared with the last state elections in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An openly right-wing extremist party has become the strongest force in a state parliament for the first time since 1949, and that causes many people very deep concern and fear,” said Omid Nouripour, a leader of the Greens, one of the national governing parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other parties say they won't put AfD in power by joining it in a coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, its strength is likely to make it extremely difficult to form new state governments, forcing other parties into exotic new coalitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a historic success for us,” Alice Weidel, a national co-leader of AfD, told Germany media. She described the result as a “requiem” for Scholz's coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CDU's national general secretary, Carsten Linnemann, said that “voters in both states knew that we wouldn't form a coalition with AfD, and it will stay that way — we are very, very clear on this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weidel denounced that as “pure ignorance” and said that “voters want AfD to participate in a government.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deep discontent with a national government notorious for infighting, anti-immigration sentiment and scepticism toward German military aid for Ukraine were among the factors that have contributed to support for populist parties in the region, which is less prosperous than western Germany. (AP)

    Gaza parents rush to vaccinate kids against polio

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A health worker administers the Polio vaccine to a Palestinian child in Zawayda in the central Gaza Strip.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ghadir Hajji rushed to a clinic on Sunday in hopes her five children would be among the first to get vaccinated against polio, which has re-emerged in war-ravaged Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "They absolutely have to be vaccinated," she told AFP as the family waited in line for a vaccine drive announced after health officials reported last month the first case of polio in the besieged territory in a quarter of a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We received text messages from the ministry of health and we showed up right away."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was joined by thousands of other Gazans whose fear of polio, which is highly contagious and potentially fatal, despite concerns for their personal security and rumours the vaccine would not be safe or effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polio-virus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water - an increasingly common problem in Gaza with much of the territory's infrastructure destroyed by Israel in its war against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disease mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and is potentially fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one clinic alone in Deir el-Balah nearly 2,000 children were vaccinated on Sunday, said Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency had mobile teams going from tent to tent, marking kids' thumbs with ink once they received their doses, Wateridge said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first doses were administered on Saturday to an unspecified number of children in the southern city of Khan Yunis, ahead of Sunday's large-scale rollout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign aims to vaccinate more than 640,000 children in the besieged Palestinian territory, devastated by almost 11 months of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the WHO said that Israel had agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" in northern, southern and central areas to facilitate vaccinations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu however, has insisted that these pauses were not amounting to any kind of ceasefire in overall fighting in Gaza. (AFP)

    Israel recovers the bodies of six hostages

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel recovered the bodies of six hostages in Gaza, including that of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, US President Joe Biden said late on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Earlier today, in a tunnel under the city of Rafah, Israeli forces recovered six bodies of hostages held by Hamas," Biden said in a statement issued by the White House. "I am devastated and outraged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said in a statement on Sunday that the bodies of Carmel Gat, Eden Yerushalmi, Alexander Lobanov, Almog Sarusi and Ori Danino had been brought to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial estimation, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short time before we reached them," military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas and its armed wing did not immediately comment on the accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 40,691 Palestinians have been killed and 94,060 injured in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since October 7, the enclave's health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war was triggered when Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, clashes broke out between Israeli troops and Palestinian fighters in the occupied West Bank as Israel pushed ahead with a military operation in the flashpoint city of Jenin. Hundreds of Israeli troops have been carrying out raids since Wednesday in one of their largest actions in the West Bank in months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Goldberg-Polin, captured at a music festival near Gaza, appeared in a video released by Hamas in late April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world," Biden said. His parents, Rachel Goldberg and Jon Polin, "have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions. I admire them and grieve with them more deeply than words can express," the president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden vowed that "Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement, "I strongly condemn Hamas’ continued brutality, and so must the entire world. Harris, the Democratic candidate running to succeed Biden, said she and he would never waver in their commitment to free the Americans and all those held hostage in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, speaking to reporters in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Biden said he was "still optimistic" about a ceasefire deal to stop the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're on the verge of having an agreement," he said. "It's time this war ended."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden added that "people are continuing to meet."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think we can close the deal, they’ve all said they agree on the principles." (Reuters)

    Rapper Fatman Scoop dies after collapsing on stage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US rapper Fatman Scoop has died, his family and manager announced on Saturday, after the 53-year-old artist suffered a medical emergency while performing on stage, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of hip-hop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scoop, best known for the hit tracks "Be Faithful" and "It Takes Scoop," collapsed on stage at Hamden Town Center Park, Connecticut and was taken to hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical staff apparently attempted to administer CPR while he was still on the stage, according to a video of the incident obtained by celebrity news site TMZ. He was then carried away on a stretcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a post on his Instagram account, his family wrote that "it is with profound sadness and very heavy hearts that we share news of the passing of the legendary and iconic Fatman Scoop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fatman Scoop was known to the world as the undisputed voice of the club. His music made us dance and embrace life with positivity," they wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scoop's manager Birch Michael confirmed his death on Facebook, writing: "I love you Scoop. Thank you so much for everything you gave to me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hip-hop star Missy Elliott wrote on X that Scoop's "voice and energy have contributed to many songs that made the people feel happy and want to dance for over two decades. Your impact is huge and will be never be forgotten."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Radio host Shelley Wade posted a photograph of herself with Scoop, writing: "We are losing too many of our hip-hop legends too soon. Rest easy, Scoop."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scoop briefly became embroiled in a political row in Australia in 2018 when the country's then-prime minister Scott Morrison posted a clip that featured his hit "Be Faithful."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morrison, a conservative evangelical Christian, deleted the post after his critics said the entertainer's lyrics were inappropriate and unparliamentary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's quite clear that that is not a song on my playlist," he later told reporters in Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The uproar prompted a response from Scoop, who tagged Morrison in an Instagram post saying: "I am humbled to have my voice rocking in the highest offices of the Australian Government!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rapper defended his lyrics: "It's a fun PARTY SONG that has no NEGATIVITY or HARM in it!!" before extending Morrison a backstage invite to a festival appearance in Australia. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768546_1_20240901040839.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for next year's Oasis reunion tour sold out by Saturday evening though fans eager to see the band play live for the first time in 16 years complained of technical issues and long online waits that often ended in disappointment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fans trying to access the three websites selling the tickets – Ticketmaster, See Tickets and Gigsandtours – reported issues including error messages and being kicked off before they could purchase tickets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was expected that more than a million tickets for the band's gigs would sell out within minutes. Instead, the band announced all the tickets in Britain had been sold 10 hours later after many fans had spent the day in online queues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has got to be a fairer, simpler, more efficient way of selling tickets," said Dan Walker, the British TV presenter, on X. "In the queue, out of the queue, refresh / don’t refresh, wait in line, back of the line."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ticketmaster earlier said its website has not crashed and the queue was moving along as fans bought tickets. Gigsandtours thanked people for their patience and said there had been "extremely high demand".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, some tickets were relisted on resale sites such as Viagogo for as much as US$10,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oasis announced 17 shows in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with the first due to take place in Cardiff in July 2025, followed by nights in Manchester – where the band was formed in 1991 – London, Edinburgh and Dublin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group, whose debut album "Definitely Maybe" was released 30 years ago, split in 2009 when lead guitarist and main songwriter Noel Gallagher said he could no longer work with his younger brother, Liam, the band's main singer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At its peak in the 1990s, Oasis exemplified the soaring appeal of Britpop, with hits like "Wonderwall," "Live Forever" and "Champagne Supernova". But Noel and Liam were often in conflict and their strained relationship finally snapped in 2009 as they prepared to play a Paris gig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since their split, both brothers have continued their musical careers, but always against the backdrop of calls from fans for the band to reunite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gigs are expected to provide a multi-million dollar boost for Britain and Ireland's hospitality sectors. (Reuters)

 Seven people, including a six-year-old and 16-year-old, were killed when a bus overturned in the US state of Mississippi early Saturday, Warren County Coroner Doug Huskey said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two young victims were siblings, according to the coroner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mississippi Highway Patrol said the incident took place around 12:40am on Interstate 20 near Bovina in Warren County, east of Vicksburg, when a 2018 Volvo commercial passenger bus traveling westbound left the roadway and overturned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-seven passengers were transported to different hospitals with unknown injuries, the agency said. It said the co-driver was not transported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anytime you have people injured or killed, it's tragic but when you have a situation like this where you have multiple fatalities and multiple injuries, it makes it even worse," Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace told an ABC affiliate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huskey said most of the passengers on the bus were Latin American. (Reuters)

 A Brazilian Supreme Court justice ordered on Friday the "immediately suspension" of social media platform X in the country, after a court-imposed deadline expired for the company to identify a legal representative in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is the latest chapter in an ongoing feud between Justice Alexandre de Moraes and Elon Musk, which also included the freezing of the satellite internet provider Starlink's financial accounts in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the decision, Moraes ordered the full and immediate suspension of X in the country until all related court orders on X were complied with, including the payment of fines amounting 18.5 million reais (US$3.28 million) and the nomination of a legal representative in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moraes ordered telecomunications regulator Anatel to implement the suspension order, and to confirm to the court within 24 hours that it has carried it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a bid to avoid the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent the blockage, Moraes said that individuals or companies who tried to keep access to the social network that way could be fined up to 50,000 reais a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  X said late on Thursday that it expected Moraes to order a shutdown "soon. Earlier this year, Moraes ordered X to block certain accounts implicated in probes of so-called digital militias accused of spreading distorted news and hate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk, denouncing the order as censorship, responded by closing the platform's offices in Brazil. X, formerly known as Twitter, said at the time that its services would still be available in Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid the underlying feud over X, Brazil's Supreme Court also blocked the local bank accounts of the Starlink satellite internet firm, which is 40 percent owned by Musk, leading the company on Friday to ask the court to suspend that decision. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed Ukraine's Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk on Friday, according to a presidential decree.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The dismissal was announced just a day after the Ukrainian military reported that an F-16 jet crashed and its pilot died while repelling a major Russian strike on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have decided to replace the commander of the Air Forces... I am eternally grateful to all our military pilots," President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his evening address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not give a reason for dismissal but mentioned that personnel must be protected, and that there was a need to strengthen the command level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's General Staff said that General Lieutenant Anatoliy Kryvonozhka would temporarily perform the duties of commander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian military did not provide a reason for Monday's crash but said the jet came down while it was approaching a Russian target. Oleshchuk said on Monday partners from the US were helping to investigate the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US defence official said that the crash did not appear to be the result of Russian fire, and possible causes from pilot error to mechanical failure were still being investigated. (Reuters)

    WHO says mpox vaccines on way to DR Congo

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vaccines are prepared at a Bavarian Nordic production line. Photo: via Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768408_1_20240830233802.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation chief said on Friday that mpox vaccines were set to arrive in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the next few days to fight a new strain of the virus.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We hope to have the first delivery in the next few days, and then it will build up," Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at a media conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 230,000 mpox doses are immediately available to be dispatched, added WHO official Tim Nguyen. These doses were donated by the European Commission and Danish mpox vaccine manufacturer Bavarian Nordic, Nguyen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO has said that its partners can start buying mpox vaccines before they are approved by the UN health agency, lifting its usual rules in a bid to get inoculations to Africa faster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is currently reviewing applications for emergency licences for two vaccines made by Bavarian Nordic and Japan's KM Biologics. Tedros said these were expected to be granted in the next two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rosamund Lewis, the WHO technical lead for mpox, said she hoped the vaccines and other interventions by health partners would help cases come down again in the near future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An mpox diagnostic manufacturer also expressed interest in securing WHO's emergency use listing for their kit a day after the agency opened the process, Tedros said without naming the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the WHO declared mpox a global public health emergency following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that spread to neighbouring countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 18,000 suspected cases of mpox have been reported in Congo so far this year with 629 deaths, while over 150 cases have also been confirmed in Burundi, Tedros said. (Reuters)

    At least 6 dead after Shanshan hits Japan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Typhoon Shanshan weakened to a tropical storm on Friday, but was still dumping heavy rains as it slowly churned through Japan, triggering transport havoc and landslide warnings, with up to six people killed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The storm, which at landfall was one of the strongest to hit Japan in decades, pummelled Kyushu island on Thursday with gusts of up to 252 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before making landfall, a landslide caused by the heavy rains preceding the storm killed three members of the same family late on Tuesday in Aichi prefecture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi on Friday confirmed reports of one additional death, but said that "the relation to the typhoon was being studied".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more were feared dead and two others were missing, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight people were seriously hurt and 70 others had light injuries, Hayashi said, with many injured by broken glass after the typhoon smashed windows and ripped tiles off roofs on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 200 buildings were damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Typhoons in the region have been forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change, according to a study released in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rapid attribution analysis issued on Friday by Imperial College London, using peer-reviewed methodology, calculated that Typhoon Shanshan's winds were made 26 percent more likely by a warming planet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without phasing out fossil fuels, the root cause of climate change, typhoons will bring even greater devastation to Japan," said Ralf Toumi, director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coming storm prompted Japanese authorities to issue their highest alert in several areas, with more than five million people advised to evacuate their homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday the Japan Meteorological Agency issued alerts for possible landslides in many parts of Kyushu, and as far away as Shizuoka on the main island of Honshu, the Tokyo region and nearby Kanagawa. (AFP)

    Israel agrees to 'pauses' in Gaza to allow polio jabs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel has agreed to a series of three-day "humanitarian pauses" in Gaza to allow UN health officials to administer polio vaccinations in the territory, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The way we discussed and agreed, the campaign will start on the first of September, in central Gaza, for three days, and there will be a humanitarian pause during the vaccination," said Rik Peeperkorn, the agency's representative for Palestinian territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vaccination rollout will also cover southern and northern Gaza, which will each get their own three-day pauses, Peeperkorn told reporters, adding that Israel had agreed to allow an additional day if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday night the new measures were "not a ceasefire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said it supports the "UN humanitarian truce."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and European Union have both voiced concern over polio in Gaza, after the first case there in 25 years was confirmed this month in an unvaccinated 10-month-old baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN agencies have said they plan to provide oral vaccines against type-2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) to more than 640,000 children in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poliovirus is highly infectious and most often spread through sewage and contaminated water – an increasingly common problem in Gaza with much of the territory's infrastructure destroyed by Israel in its war against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disease mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause deformities and paralysis, and is potentially fatal. (AFP)

    US Army criticises Trump staff over 'push' at cemetery

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Army on Thursday took aim at Donald Trump's staff over a visit by the Republican presidential candidate to the country's most hallowed resting place for its war dead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump went to the Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington with family members of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing during the last hours of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His campaign posted photos from the visit, including one showing him giving a thumbs-up gesture while standing with relatives at the grave of one of the Marines killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Army said an Arlington employee was "abruptly pushed aside" when she sought to ensure a law prohibiting political activity or filming on cemetery grounds was followed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the (Arlington National Cemetery) employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked," an Army spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going on the offensive, Trump's campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita has described the employee as a "despicable individual," while campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said she was "clearly suffering from a mental health episode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has made criticism of President Joe Biden's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a key note of his campaign ahead of the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The withdrawal was made as part of a peace deal signed by the Trump administration with the Taliban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uproar over the incident at Arlington on Monday is the latest controversy in Trump's troubled relationship with the military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military said troops killed a Palestinian militant leader and six others on Thursday, the second day of large-scale "counter-terrorism" operations in the occupied West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A military spokesman gave an overall death toll of 16 Palestinian militants since Israeli forces launched coordinated raids across the northern West Bank on Wednesday. The Palestinian health ministry reported at least 15 dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A military statement said five were killed on Thursday in the Tulkarem refugee camp including Muhammad Jaber, also known as Abu Shujaa. Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said he was its commander in the nearby Nur Shams refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, "he was a head of a terror network in Nur Shams," also accusing Jaber of "inciting" young Palestinians to carry out attacks against Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoshani told an online media briefing that Jaber was killed in "a significant exchange of fire" between Israeli forces and "armed terrorists hiding" in a mosque in the Tulkarem camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tulkarem governor Mustafa Taqatqa rejected the army's account, saying the five men were not inside the mosque when killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A rocket was fired at a house and the young men were not in the mosque," said Taqatqa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoshani said that one member of the Israeli security forces was injured in the operation that killed Jaber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military separately said it killed two "terrorists" in Jenin, also in the northern West Bank, taking its reported death toll of Palestinian militants to 16 since the raids began early on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the military, nine of them were killed on Wednesday, the first day of the simultaneous raids. (AFP)

    Blue Origin completes latest space tourism flight

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Blue Origin flew its latest group of six thrill-seekers to the edge of space and back again on Thursday, including the youngest-ever woman to complete the feat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mission NS-26 marked the eighth human spaceflight for the company, founded by Jeff Bezos, as it presses ahead in the emerging suborbital tourism market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Karsen Kitchen, a 21-year-old senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, became the youngest woman ever to cross the Karman Line, the internationally recognised boundary marking the edge of space, 100 kilometres above the Earth's surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin's small New Shepard rocket blasted off at 8:00 am local time (1300 GMT) from the company's Launch Site One base in west Texas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After liftoff, the sleek and spacious capsule separated from its booster, which boasts zero carbon emissions, before the rocket performed a precise vertical landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the spaceship soared beyond the Karman Line, passengers had the chance to marvel at the Earth's curvature and unbuckle their seatbelts to float during a few minutes of weightlessness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being there in the darkness of space... there's no way to talk about how impressive that is," said Rob Ferl, a Nasa-funded researcher who conducted an experiment during the flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule then reentered the atmosphere, deploying its parachutes for a desert landing near the launch site. The total flight time is typically around 10 to 11 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of its tickets, but prices are believed to vary significantly based on the individual selected, their net worth, and the social capital they bring to the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first seat sold in a 2021 charity auction went for US$28 million, but notable guests like Star Trek actor William Shatner have flown on Blue Origin flights for free. Others have reported paying several hundred thousand dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin's main competitor in the suborbital space market, Virgin Galactic, is currently on a two-year pause from commercial operations as it upgrades its fleet. (AFP)

 A court in Thailand on Thursday found Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, a member of a famous Spanish acting family, guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced him to life in prison, in a lurid case that involved the victim being dismembered.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Koh Samui Provincial Court issued an initial sentence of death for Sancho, but commuted it to life imprisonment due to his cooperation during the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, a 30-year-old chef with a YouTube channel, had been charged with the murder of Edwin Arrieta Arteaga, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon from Colombia, while the two were on the Thai holiday island of Koh Pha-ngan in August last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The island is famous for its monthly “Full Moon” beach parties, attracting travellers from around the world for all-night raves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convicted man is the son of Rodolfo Sancho Aguirre, a prominent Spanish actor, and Silvia Bronchalo, who has also been in acting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both parents are 49 years old and attended Thursday's court session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At his trial on the island of Samui, Sancho claimed he got into a fight with Arrieta for allegedly trying to sexually assault him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that Arrieta fell as they scuffled and hit his head on a bathtub, losing consciousness and then dying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had pleaded not guilty to charges of premeditated murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho acknowledged dismembering the victim’s body and disposing of the parts on land and at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the charge of concealing or damaging a body, he received a four-month prison sentence, reduced to two months for acknowledging the act, said Paisan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had also pleaded not guilty to the charge of destroying another person's documents — the victim’s passport — for which he received a two-year prison term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The elements of the case — violent death on a holiday island, the celebrity connections and the lurid details — attracted huge coverage in Spanish media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HBO produced a Spanish-language documentary on the events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case came to light when trash collectors found what the Bangkok Post newspaper described as a sawed-off pelvis and intestines weighing about 5 kilos in a sack at a rubbish dump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly after that, Sancho reported to police that Arrieta was missing, and officers then gathered evidence linking the two men that led them to detain and interrogate him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police established a narrative, claiming to the press that Sancho had confessed to the murder and saying he had planned it because Arrieta threatened to disgrace him and his family by revealing their alleged sexual relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sancho, through his father and his lawyers, said that was a distorted version of what he told police, and denied having a sexual relationship with Arrieta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police obtained surveillance video showing Sancho allegedly purchasing a knife, rubber gloves, garbage bags and cleaning solutions at a convenience store before Arrieta's death, which prosecutors claimed bolstered the charge of premeditated murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his closing statement earlier in his trial, Sancho told the court he regretted his actions, the Spanish newspaper El País reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am sorry that a life has been lost and that parents have lost a son,” Sancho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am sorry that his family was not able to bury him properly. I’m sorry for what I did after the death.” (AP)

    Court threatens to shut down X in Brazil

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian Supreme Court justice on Wednesday threatened to shut down the local operations of X, formerly Twitter, unless its billionaire owner Elon Musk named a legal representative in Brazil within 24 hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The order from Justice Alexandre de Moraes was the latest development in an ongoing feud with Musk’s platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company clashed with de Moraes earlier this year over free speech, accounts associated with the far-right and misinformation on the platform, with the social media platform claiming to be a victim of censorship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, X said it was removing all remaining Brazil staff in the country “effective immediately,” saying de Moraes had threatened its legal representative in the country with arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil's Supreme Court on Wednesday notified X of de Moraes’ order in a reply to a post from the company’s global government affairs account on the social platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In case of non-compliance with the determination, the decision could bring about suspension of the social media network’s activities in Brazil,” the court said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the United States, free speech is a constitutional right that’s more permissive than in many countries, including Brazil, where de Moraes in April ordered an investigation into Musk over the dissemination of defamatory fake news and another probe over possible obstruction, incitement and criminal organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazil’s political right has long characterised de Moraes as overstepping his bounds to clamp down on free speech and engage in political persecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His defenders have said his actions are lawful, supported by at least the majority of the court’s bench, and have served to protect democracy at a time when it is threatened. (AP)

    Dozens hurt as typhoon hits southern Japan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Typhoon Shanshan slammed into Japan on Thursday, injuring dozens as howling winds smashed windows and blew tiles off houses while torrential rains sparked floods and landslide warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japan's most powerful typhoon this year, packing gusts up to 252 kilometres per hour, made landfall on the main southern island of Kyushu, home to 12.5 million people, around 8am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the arrival, authorities issued their highest alert level in places, advising hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate and warning of "life-threatening" flooding, landslides and storm surges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coastal city of Miyazaki has so far recorded 26 injuries – including some from a tornado – with 124 incidents of damage to buildings, a disaster official told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the injuries were caused by strong winds smashing windows, with none life-threatening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Broadcaster NHK reported that nine people were hurt in nearby Kagoshima.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unverified social media footage showed a small river in the city of Beppu turned into a raging torrent of dark water and a fallen tree hanging precipitously above a rainswept road near Oita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student Aoi Nishimoto, 18, said he had called his family in Miyazaki.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our home is fine, but there was a tornado in Miyazaki and power went out in some places. It's worrying," he told AFP in Kyushu's main city Fukuoka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, I am away from my parents' home for the first time. So it's a bit scary being all alone," student Rio Ohtsuru, 19, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maybe I will look for a flashlight in case of a power outage," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyushu's utility operator said that 254,610 houses were already without power elsewhere on the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The system was moving slowly, which often means more rain, with the weather office forecasting it to gradually rumble towards Japan's main island Honshu and the cities of Osaka and Nagoya, although this could change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned that "the risk of a disaster due to heavy rain can rapidly escalate in western Japan as Friday approaches."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Kagoshima, the JMA issued "special warnings of violent storms, high waves and high tides".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please exercise maximum vigilance against violent storms, high waves and high tides in Kagoshima, as well as landslides, flooding in low-lying areas and overflowing rivers in southern Kyushu," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For southern Kyushu, the JMA predicted an enormous 1,100 millimetres of precipitation in the 48 hours to Friday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy rain brought by Shanshan has been lashing large parts of Japan since Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three members of a family died after a landslide buried a house in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture, late Tuesday, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deceased included a couple in their 70s as well as a son in his 30s, while two adult daughters in their 40s survived with injuries, Kyodo News reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Auto giant Toyota has suspended production at all 14 of its factories in Japan. Nissan and Honda also decided to halt operations at their Kyushu plants, reports said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan Airlines has cancelled 275 domestic flights for Thursday, affecting 14,893 passengers, and an additional 13 for Friday that would have carried 1,307 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ANA scrapped 212 domestic flights slated for Thursday, affecting 18,700 passengers, and 42 Friday flights, affecting 4,200 more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanshan comes in the wake of Typhoon Ampil, which disrupted hundreds of flights and trains this month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief of Telegram Pavel Durov on Wednesday was charged by the French judiciary with a litany of violations related to the messaging app but allowed to go free while being banned from leaving the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Durov was granted conditional release against a bail of five million euros and on the condition he must report to a police station twice a week as well as remaining in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement following an hours-long hearing with two investigating magistrates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges concern alleged crimes involving an organised group including "complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable an illicit transaction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov has also been charged with refusing to share documents demanded by authorities as well as "dissemination in an organised group of images of minors in child pornography" as well as drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said that the French judicial authorities had been made aware of the "near total absence of a response" from Telegram to requests from the authorities and had first opened an investigation in February 2024. (AFP)

    UK's Starmer promises 'reset' on Germany trip

    <![CDATA[<img alt="UK PM Keir Starmer's Labour Party has said it would seek a security and defence treaty with Olaf Scholz's Germany as part of a wider push to mend ties with the EU. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768063_1_20240829014505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on a visit to Berlin on Wednesday that a planned new treaty with Germany was part of his nation's push to mend EU ties damaged by Brexit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move toward a reset, welcomed by German leader Olaf Scholz, will also include the British premier travelling to Paris for talks with President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said the proposed accord, set to include a defence agreement and deeper links on science, technology as well as trade, was hoped to be agreed by year's end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British premier called the planned treaty a "once in a generation chance" to aid a "wider reset" in UK-EU ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz welcomed his UK counterpart's desire for a "reset," adding: "We want to accept this outstretched hand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour had said it would seek a security and defence treaty with Germany if it won the July 4 general election, which it did by a landslide – propelling Starmer to the premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's host Scholz has been under pressure to crack down on illegal migration after a suspected Islamist knife attack in the western city of Solingen on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stabbing, which left three people dead and eight injured, was allegedly carried out by a 26-year-old Syrian man who evaded attempts by German authorities to deport him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's premiership has faced an early challenge after a deadly knife attack in Southport last month sparked anti-immigration riots, which officials say were stoked by far-right elements and false information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said that he and Scholz had "agreed to develop a joint action plan to tackle illegal migration" and "smash the smuggler gangs who perpetrate this vile trade."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair also discussed the war in Ukraine, with both countries under pressure over their aid for Kyiv to help it fight off Russia's assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz insisted that both countries "stand firm at Ukraine's side," despite "recent attempts to sow doubt about this commitment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our resolve is as ever to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine to provide the support that it needs for as long as it needs," Starmer added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv's Western allies have reacted cautiously to Ukraine's recent incursion into Kursk, worried that their weapons could be used on Russian soil, possibly sparking a strong reaction from Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain allows Kyiv to deploy a squadron of 14 British-made Challenger 2 tanks as it sees fit, but has put limits on the use of its long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said on Wednesday that "no new decisions have been taken" in terms relating to tactical questions on the use of weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has repeatedly refused to send Kyiv its long-range Taurus missiles, over fears of escalating the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has been the second-largest contributor of aid to Ukraine after the United States, but plans to halve the budget for that aid next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Where Germany spent around eight billion euros (US$9 billion) on aid for Ukraine in 2024, the latest draft earmarks around four billion euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a European Political Community (EPC) summit in England two weeks after his election win, Starmer told European leaders the UK would be a "friend and partner" to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has ruled out rejoining the European single market, customs union or freedom of movement – to avoid reopening what remains a thorny issue among British politicians and the public alike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he does want to negotiate a new security pact with the bloc and a veterinary agreement to ease border checks on agricultural foods, as well as an improved trading deal. (AFP)

    Tens of millions bake under extreme heat in eastern US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People cool off at a reflecting pool at the World War II Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, DC. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768062_1_20240829012725.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 60 million people were sweltering under heat alerts on Wednesday as a late-summer surge of extreme temperatures blanketed much of the eastern half of the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Record heat was expected to impact the mid-Atlantic states with temperature highs of around 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) in and around the capital Washington, the National Weather Service said, though the heat wave was expected to be short-lived as a cooler and damper front moves in from Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, much of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys will feel a couple more days of high temperatures topping into the upper 90s at the hottest locations," added NWS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Baltimore, the mayor's office issued a "code red extreme heat alert" and posted on X the locations of five cooling centres opened to support the city's homeless population. Authorities were also distributing cold water to those without shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advised people who are outdoors in regions where the heat threat is considered "major" to stay in the shade, take breaks, and confine their activities to the coolest parts of the day or evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also important to carry a bottle of water, limit intake of caffeine, and monitor urine colour for signs of dehydration, the agency advised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate change has been extending the heat season across much of the United States, increasing both the frequency and intensity of heat waves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the US, even though heat-related illnesses and deaths are largely preventable through outreach and intervention, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association found heat-related mortality rates in the United States increased between 1999 and 2023, especially during the last seven years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the true number of heat-related deaths is probably still being underestimated, the authors wrote, due to potential misclassification of causes of death and a lack of data on vulnerable populations. (AFP)

    Pope says repelling, abandoning migrants a 'grave sin'

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Pope says the Mediterranean – where more than 3,000 migrants went missing last year, according to UN figures – has become a "cemetery." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768060_1_20240829004835.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis condemned on Wednesday efforts to repel migrants and block their routes as a "grave sin," as he recalled those who lost their lives, including those "abandoned" in the desert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 87-year-old regularly calls for more empathy for people fleeing conflict, poverty, disasters or persecution, particularly those seeking to reach Europe from Africa across the Mediterranean Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dedicated his address at his weekly audience on Wednesday to the subject, warning against "restrictive laws" and the "militarisation of borders" and calling for safe migration routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It must be said clearly: there are those who work systematically and with every means possible to repel migrants. And this, when done with awareness and responsibility, is a grave sin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He repeated that the Mediterranean – where more than 3,000 migrants went missing last year, according to UN figures – has become a "cemetery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some deserts too, unfortunately, are becoming cemeteries of migrants. And even here it is not always a question of 'natural' deaths. No," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At times, they have been taken to the desert and abandoned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the time of satellites and drones, there are migrant men, women and children that no-one must see. Only God sees them and hears their cry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not specify any particular country but said that his description of seas and deserts also includes oceans, lakes and rivers, as well as forests, jungles and steppes "where migrants walk alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Brothers and sisters, we can all agree on one thing: migrants should not be in those seas and in those lethal deserts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it is not through more restrictive laws, it is not with the militarisation of borders, it is not with rejection that we will obtain this result," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called for "safe and legal" routes for migrants and asylum seekers, and greater international efforts to combat human trafficking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Union admitted in May to a "difficult situation" after a journalism consortium said Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania were dumping migrants in the desert, using the bloc's funds.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched raids on Wednesday across the occupied West Bank, where its forces killed at least nine Palestinians and sealed off the volatile city of Jenin, according to Palestinian officials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jewish state has carried out near-daily raids across the West Bank since Hamas' October 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the ongoing war there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militant groups said they were exchanging fire with the Israeli military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governor of Jenin, Kamal Abu al-Rub, said on Palestinian radio that Israeli forces had surrounded the city, blocking exit and entry points and access to hospitals, and ripping up infrastructure in the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank said Israeli forces had blocked the roads leading to a hospital with dirt barriers and surrounded other medical facilities in Jenin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military confirmed it was operating in the cities of Jenin and Tulkarem but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz drew comparisons with Gaza and called for similar measures in the West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must deal with the threat just as we deal with the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and whatever steps might be required. This is a war in every respect, and we must win it," he wrote on the platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank to rise up, saying the raids are part of a larger plan to expand the war in Gaza and blaming the escalation on US support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 652 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli fire since the war in Gaza began over 10 months ago, according to the Palestinian ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most have died during such raids, which often trigger gun battles with militants. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan issued an emergency warning on Wednesday as powerful Typhoon Shanshan approached the southwestern region with heavy rain and strong winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Airlines and rail operators cancelled some services over the coming days as the typhoon, categorised as "very strong", packed strong winds and gusts of up to 252 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maximum caution is required given that forecasts are for strong winds, high waves and high tides that have not been seen thus far," the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanshan is expected to strike the southwestern Kyushu island over the next few days and approach the central and eastern regions, which includes the capital Tokyo, around the weekend, JMA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities issued evacuation orders for more than 800,000 residents in Kagoshima prefecture in Kyushu and the central Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two people were missing after a landslide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A wall of mud, rocks and other debris on Tuesday swept away a house in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture. Three others had been pulled out, according to public broadcaster NHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The typhoon also prompted Toyota Motor to suspend operations at all of its domestic factories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 28 production lines at 14 group companies will suspend operations from Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Typhoon Shanshan is the latest storm to hit Japan following last week's Typhoon Ampil, which also led to blackouts and evacuations. (Reuters/AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767995_1_20240828161624.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of protesters clashed in India's eastern city of Kolkata on Wednesday as demonstrations seeking justice for a murdered doctor spiralled into violent street skirmishes between political rivals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's body at a state-run hospital in Kolkata on August 9 stoked nationwide anger over the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sparked strikes by medics and rallies backed by thousands of ordinary citizens across India, although many doctors have since returned to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But repeated protests in West Bengal state capital Kolkata have transformed into clashes between the state's ruling All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hindu-nationalist BJP is the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and holds power nationally, but sits in opposition in West Bengal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want justice", BJP supporters chanted, referring to the murdered doctor, then demanding the resignation of AITMC leader Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Go back! Go back!" AITMC supporters shouted in return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, police clashed with protesters, firing tear gas canisters and water cannons, and arresting at least 245 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That prompted BJP supporters on Wednesday to launch a day-long shutdown of Kolkata, with skirmishes against AITMC supporters in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters erected barricades to close roads and railway lines, with police reporting clashes between rival workers across the city and in adjoining districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man has been detained for the murder, but Banerjee's government has faced public criticism for the handling of the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Supreme Court has ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the "horrific" killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation". (AFP)

    Trump faces revised indictment in 2020 election case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Special counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment against Donald Trump over his alleged efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767987_1_20240828152343.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump faced a revised federal indictment on Tuesday accusing him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, with prosecutors narrowing their approach after a US Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US Special Counsel Jack Smith's team obtained the superseding indictment in the Washington case, though it was highly unlikely to proceed to trial ahead of the November 5 election when Trump faces his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised indictment lays out the same four charges prosecutors brought against the former president last year, but this one focuses on Trump's role as a political candidate seeking re-election, rather than as the president at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that Trump is at least presumptively immune from criminal prosecution for actions that were within his constitutional powers as president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington was expected to decide in coming weeks which aspects of the case must be tossed out based on the Supreme Court's immunity decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump in a statement on his Truth Social media platform said the Supreme Court's immunity ruling should lead to the entire case being thrown out, saying, "Smith rewrote the exact same case in an effort to circumvent the Supreme Court Decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, denouncing this case and the others he faces as politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls have shown Harris opening up a narrow national lead over Trump since President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This indictment, like the initial one, accuses Trump of a multi-part conspiracy to block the certification of his election defeat to Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It retains allegations Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to use his role presiding over the congressional certification of the election on January 6, 2021, to reject electoral votes from battleground states Trump lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on that January 6 in an attempt to halt the congressional certification, which remains part of the case against Trump. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767918_1_20240828062642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX is poised for another attempt at launching a daring orbital expedition featuring an all-civilian crew that is aiming to carry out the first-ever spacewalk by private citizens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Polaris Dawn mission, organised by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman is now set to lift off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a four-hour window beginning on Wednesday at 3:38 am local time (0738 GMT), with backup opportunities available on Thursday if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather conditions appeared 85 percent favourable, according to a US Space Force forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier launch attempt on Tuesday was scrapped due to a helium leak on a line connecting the tower to the rocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket, the SpaceX Dragon capsule is set to reach a peak altitude of 1,400 kilometres – higher than any crewed mission in more than half a century, since the Apollo era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mission commander Isaacman will guide his four-member team through the mission's centrepiece: the first-ever spacewalk carried out by non-professional astronauts, equipped with sleek, newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rounding out the team are mission pilot Scott Poteet, a retired US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel; mission specialist Sarah Gillis, a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX; and mission specialist and medical officer Anna Menon, also a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quartet underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, centrifuge training, scuba diving, and summiting an Ecuadorian volcano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polaris Dawn is set to be the first of three missions under the Polaris programme, a collaboration between Isaacman, the founder of tech company Shift4 Payments, and SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isaacman declined to reveal his total investment in the project, though reports suggest he paid around US$200 million for the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission in September 2021, the first all-civilian orbital mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day, venturing briefly into the Van Allen radiation belt, a region teeming with high-energy charged particles that can pose health risks to humans over extended periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On day three, the crew will don their state-of-the-art EVA spacesuits – outfitted with heads-up displays, helmet cameras, and advanced joint mobility systems – and take turns to venture outside their spacecraft in twos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each will spend 15 to 20 minutes in space, 700 kilometres above Earth's surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on their to-do list are testing laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and Starlink, SpaceX's more than 6,000-strong constellation of internet satellites, in a bid to boost space communication speeds, and conducting nearly 40 scientific experiments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include tests with contact lenses embedded with microelectronics to continuously monitor changes in eye pressure and shape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After six days in space, the mission will conclude with a splashdown off the coast of Florida. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in India fired tear gas and water cannon on Tuesday as they clashed with thousands of protesters seeking justice for a doctor who was raped and murdered in Kolkata this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a state-run hospital in the eastern city stoked nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's demonstration saw thousands march to a government building in Kolkata to demand the resignation of Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They shouted slogans and clashed with police, who charged the crowd with batons in an effort to disperse it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Namita Ghosh, a college student who attended the protest, said that the crowd had intended to "protest peacefully" before the baton charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 100 protesters "have been arrested on the charge of creating violence," a senior police official said on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous protests in Kolkata prompted by the crime have transformed into unruly political rallies, with police scuffling with demonstrators from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) angry at the state government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hindu-nationalist BJP is the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but it is an opposition party in West Bengal, of which Kolkata is the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have accused Banerjee's government of creating an unsafe environment for women that allowed crimes including the doctor's murder to occur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman's body was found in the teaching hospital's seminar hall, suggesting she had gone there for a break during a 36-hour shift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doctors' associations in many cities launched strikes over the murder that cut off non-essential services, though medical professionals have since returned to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man has been detained over the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gruesome nature of the attack has invoked comparisons with the horrific 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That incident sparked widespread outrage in a country where sexual violence against women is endemic, with an average of nearly 90 rapes a day were reported in 2022 in the country of 1.4 billion people. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='General Director of the IAEA Rafael Grossi says he was in "close contact" with Russian authorities and would visit Kyiv next week. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767893_1_20240827225153.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UN nuclear watchdog head Rafael Grossi on Tuesday warned during a visit to Russia's Kursk nuclear plant that its proximity to ongoing fighting was "extremely serious" following Ukraine's unprecedented cross-border offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Grossi said his tour enabled him to "look at the most important parts" of the plant, which is less than 50 kilometres from fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A nuclear power plant of this type so close to a point of contact or military front is an extremely serious fact," Grossi said after visiting the plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact we have military activity a few kilometres, a few miles away from here, make it an immediate point of attention," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the end of the day, again, this may sound common sense and simple: Don't attack a nuclear power plant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was in "close contact" with Russian authorities and would visit Kyiv next week to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, adding it was "important to talk" and "keep dialogue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Kursk power plant currently was "operating in a very close to normal conditions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned of the dangers of fighting around nuclear plants following Russia's full-scale military offensive into Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first days of the conflict, Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, and also briefly held the decommissioned Chernobyl plant in the north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine launched its surprise incursion into Kursk on August 6 and has said it is making advances, even as Russian forces move deeper into eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused Ukraine of trying to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant, with drone fragments found near its spent nuclear fuel storage facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was informed about the impact of drones, I was shown some of the remnants of those, signs of impact they had," Grossi said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant lies some 60 kilometres from the Russia-Ukraine border, next to the Seym river, and less than 50 kilometres away from Kursk city, the region's capital with a population of around 440,000. (AFP)

 The Israeli military said it rescued an Israeli hostage in Gaza on Tuesday after a "complex operation", as the Israel-Hamas war, now in its 11th month, showed no signs of abating.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kaid Alkadi, a 52-year-old Israeli Bedouin, was abducted by Palestinian militants during the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kaid Alkadi was rescued... in a complex operation in the southern Gaza Strip," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is in a stable medical condition and is being transferred for medical checks to a hospital."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alkadi is a resident of Rahat, a mainly Arab town, and on October 7 he had been working as a guard at a warehouse in southern Israel when he was seized by militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to seizing every opportunity to bring the hostages back to their homes," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the rescue of Alkadi was "miraculous".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, we must remember that military operations alone cannot free the remaining hostages who have suffered 326 days of abuse and terror," it said, insisting only a ceasefire could ensure the return of other captives", it said adding that "a negotiated deal is the only way forward".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On October 7, militants attacked southern Israeli communities in an unprecedented attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 104 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign since then has killed at least 40,476 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory. Most of the dead are women and children, according to UN rights office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the United Nations said humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip has taken a serious blow after Israel ordered a new evacuation in the centre of the besieged territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday the Israeli military ordered people to "evacuate immediately" a part of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, sparking a rapid exodus of civilians and displacing UN and NGO workers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Oasis will reunite for a tour, the Britpop band known for their timeless hits like “Wonderwall” and “Don't Look Back in Anger” announced Tuesday, ending a 15-year hiatus and, presumably, the long-held feud between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The guitar band said tickets for the 14-date tour will go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday. The tour will begin July 4-5, 2025 in Cardiff, Wales, before moving on to four dates in Manchester, four at London's Wembley stadium, two in Edinburgh and two in Dublin where the tour will conclude on Aug. 17, the band said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is it. This is happening,″ the band said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oasis split in 2009 after many years of infighting, with Noel Gallagher officially leaving the band just before a performance at a festival near Paris. Even before the dissolution, the brothers had long had an antagonistic relationship and reportedly did not speak to each other for years after the breakup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer,” Noel Gallagher, the band's guitarist and songwriter, wrote in a statement at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the Gallagher brothers haven’t performed together since, both regularly perform Oasis songs at their solo gigs. They've also each fired off criticisms of the other in the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noel Gallagher accused his younger brother of having a hangover that forced them to cancel a 2009 concert. The frontman disputed the accusation and sued, later dropping the lawsuit. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Tuesday arrived in Beijing where he will hold talks with senior officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a three-day visit aimed at easing tensions between the two countries ahead of the November presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sullivan's plane landed just before 2pm and was greeted at the airport by US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan wants to expand military-to-military talks between the China and the US down to the theatre command level, a move Washington hopes could help manage tensions in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US also wants China to take more action at home to prevent the development of chemicals that can be made into fentanyl, the leading cause of American drug overdoses, and reach an understanding about safety standards for artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing plans to express its disapproval over US tariffs on a range of manufactured goods and export controls targeting Chinese chip makers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US has continuously taken unreasonable measures against China in terms of tariffs, export controls, investment reviews and unilateral sanctions, which have seriously undermined China's legitimate rights and interests," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency said Sullivan's visit will mark the start of a new round of strategic communication between the two sides. "This visit is another opportunity for both nations to stabilise their bilateral relationship and seek common ground amid rising global uncertainties," Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Sullivan's first visit to China and the first by a US national security advisor to the country in eight years. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was charged on Tuesday with sedition over a speech he made that allegedly questioned the integrity of the country's previous king.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin, who led Malaysia from March 2020 until August 2021, pleaded not guilty in a court in northeast Kelantan state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the charge sheet, Muhyiddin made the seditious remarks last month during a by-election campaign in Kelantan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine ethnic Malay state rulers take turns as Malaysia’s king for five-year terms under the country’s rotating monarchy, which began when Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but are revered by the nation's majority Muslims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his speech on August 14, Muhyiddin had questioned why then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah didn't invite him to be prime minister following a hung Parliament in November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin had claimed he had the backing of majority lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin's Islamic nationalistic bloc received stronger-than-expected support from Malays, who account for two-thirds of Malaysia’s 34 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sultan Abdullah appointed then-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister after Anwar cobbled up support from rival parties to form a unity government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sultan Abdullah from central Pahang state, who ended his reign in January this year, didn't comment on the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his son issued a strong rebuke to Muhyiddin, saying his remarks were dangerous and could divide the people and undermine the royal institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin was questioned by police following complaints against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied insulting the royalty, saying his remarks were factual and that he had handed in a sworn oath of support by 115 lawmakers in the 222-member parliament. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian authorities issued new air raid alerts across the country on Tuesday as Russian bombers took to the skies, a day after Moscow carried out a "massive" attack on Ukraine's power grid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia fired hundreds of drones and missiles at Ukraine on Monday, killing at least four people and battering the country's already weakened energy grid, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian attack triggered widespread blackouts and came after Kyiv claimed new advances in its incursion in Russia's Kursk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's air force confirmed early Tuesday the "takeoff of several Tu-95MS from the Engels airfield" in western Russia, prompting air raid alerts across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three more people were killed in overnight Russian attacks, according to local officials, two in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rig and one in southeastern Zaporizhzhia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched at least 127 missiles and 109 drones in "one of the largest Russian attacks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of those, 102 missiles and 99 drones were shot down, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk, who described it as Russia's "most massive" attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and Britain both condemned the assault, with US President Joe Biden calling it "outrageous" and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy branding it "cowardly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany's foreign ministry said that "once again, Putin's Russia is saturating Ukraine's lifelines with missiles". (AFP)

    UN says movement of aid, aid workers in Gaza halted

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Israeli military has told people in Deir al-Balah to evacuate immediately. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767753_1_20240827033817.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations said on Monday it had to halt the movement of aid and aid workers within Gaza due to a new Israeli evacuation order for the Deir al-Balah area, which had become a hub for its workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A senior UN official had earlier said that UN operations had stopped completely within the Strip, but officials later clarified that operations "in situ" and "embedded" with local populations would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the official, the UN had relocated most of its personnel in operations to Deir al-Balah following a Rafah evacuation order several months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said on Monday it was targeting "terror operatives" in Deir al-Balah and working to dismantle the remaining "infrastructure" of Hamas, whose October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has told people to evacuate immediately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the UN humanitarian agency (Ocha), 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers and four UN warehouses were affected, being either in or near the area ordered to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After it appeared that the UN had shut down its Gaza operations, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, clarified that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees was continuing operations, although under restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What our senior UN official was referring to is UN officials and UN humanitarian staff moving about," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If humanitarian workers are embedded with a certain population in a certain area, they have the tools to operate and to share and to distribute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They will do so," he added, though warning that it would be "half a drop in a barrel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam Rose, senior deputy field director for Unrwa in Gaza, added that "health services continue across eight or nine primary healthcare centres and over 90 health points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But indeed, the space and the ability of the UN system, of the humanitarian system to operate in Gaza is becoming increasingly difficult," Rose added. (AFP)

    Paris metro 'impossible' for disabled, admits boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Paris metro comprises more than 300 stations, but only 29 stops are wheelchair-accessible. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767747_1_20240827012015.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Paris regional transport network admitted on Monday that the city's metro system is near-impossible for disabled people to navigate as the French capital prepares to host the Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Games start on Wednesday, with a lack of accessible metro transport for disabled visitors a major gripe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first Paris metro opened in 1900 and the network has grown into the busiest system in the European Union, with more than 300 stations spread over 16 lines carrying over four million passengers daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But only 29 stops are wheelchair-accessible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city's historic metro lines "remain the weak spot" in terms of accessibility, said Valerie Pecresse, who as president of the Paris region also runs its transport network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called for a massive effort to fix the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While all buses running in central Paris can take wheelchairs, only 25 percent of rail services – metros, trams and the RER suburban mass transit system – were accessible, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the metro could be modernised in terms of accessibility, she told reporters, although it would take 20 years and cost between 15 and 20 billion euros (US$16.7 to 22.3 billion) in investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an effort "could become the great project of this decade", she said, dubbing the idea "A Metro for All."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris's preparations for the Paralympics, which run to September 8, has highlighted the lack of accessible transportation in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Pecresse said some solutions had been put in place for the Games, including around 100 minibuses to take disabled visitors to competition venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There would also be a smartphone app to help them prepare their journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities expect up to 300,000 daily visitors during the Paralympics, about half that of the Olympics. (AFP)

    Israel strikes Gaza after Lebanon flare-up

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military struck the Gaza Strip on Monday a day after truce talks in Cairo coincided with a major but brief cross-border escalation involving Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, has drawn in Tehran-aligned armed groups across the Middle East, repeatedly heightening fears of a broader regional conflagration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the latest flare-up between Israel and Hamas-ally Hezbollah, the Lebanese group on Sunday launched rockets and drones in retaliation for a top commander's killing as Israel carried out air raids the military said thwarted a larger attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel swiftly revoked a state of emergency declared early on Sunday, and Hezbollah said its operation was "completed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intense diplomacy has sought to head off a broader retaliation for the late July killings of senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike on Beirut, and of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators held meetings in the Egyptian capital on Sunday but reported no breakthrough in months of protracted negotiations to end the Gaza war as the fighting raged on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key sticking point has been Israel's insistence that it keep control of several strategic areas, including the so-called Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, to stop Hamas from re-arming, something the militant group has refused to countenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cairo, which has been mediating the talks alongside Qatar and the United States, made clear on Monday it would not support continued Israeli control of the corridor, according to state-linked media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt "reiterated to all parties that it will not accept any Israeli presence" along the corridor, Al-Qahera news reported, citing a high-level source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the ground, witnesses reported air strikes and shelling in Gaza City and other parts of the besieged Palestinian territory overnight and Israel's military said it had struck militants in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medics said an air strike on a Gaza City house killed at least five people, with two rescuers saying more victims may be buried in the ruins in Al-Rimal neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still martyrs and body parts under the rubble," ambulance driver Hussein Muhaysen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli military statement said troops had "eliminated" dozens of militants over the past day in the southern areas of Khan Younis and Rafah, and near Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,435 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not break down civilian and militant deaths. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants in their attack, 105 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces throughout the war, in what the group says is support for its Palestinian ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After weeks of retaliation threats, Hezbollah early on Sunday launched what it said was part of its response to Shukr's killing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking hours after Hezbollah announced its attacks on Israel with hundreds of rockets and drones, the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah said the "main target" was an intelligence base outside Tel Aviv, more than 100 kilometres from the Lebanese border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said there were "no hits" on the Glilot intelligence complex, which according to Israeli media is home to the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli air strikes at the same time hit more than 270 targets in Lebanon, "90 percent" of which were rockets "aimed at northern Israel," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet the strikes were "not the final word" in the campaign against Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasrallah appeared to suggest Hezbollah's retaliation for Shukr's killing might be over, saying "if the result is satisfactory" then its response "has been accomplished."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Foreign Minister Nasser Kanani praised the Hezbollah attack, saying the "strategic balance has undergone fundamental changes" to the detriment of Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas official said that a delegation from the group met mediators in Egypt's capital on Sunday. Israeli negotiators were also scheduled to go to Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks have been based on a framework laid out in late May by US President Joe Biden and a "bridging proposal" Washington put forth earlier this month with support from Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 10 months of war have left large parts of Gaza in ruins, ravaged its healthcare system and sparked a dire humanitarian crisis and warnings of famine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A batch of polio vaccines entered Gaza on Sunday, Israeli authorities said. UN agencies have planned a mass inoculation drive after the first case there in 25 years was confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successive Israeli evacuation orders have forced many Gazans, most of whom have already been displaced at least once by the war, to move again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters on Sunday from her hospital bed outside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, Tamam al-Raei said she did not know where to seek safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a war injury. I have broken bones and have had an amputation, and I have been receiving treatment for that," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now they're telling us to evacuate Al-Aqsa. Where do we go? Where do I get treatment?" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said its military was carrying out armed patrols near the Myanmar border this week, with Beijing concerned about the potential fallout from a civil war on the other side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Troops were deployed to Yunnan Province on Monday to test their ability to maintain security in border areas, the military’s Southern Theatre Command said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An alliance of ethnic militias has dealt a series of setbacks to Myanmar's military in the country's northeast, which is near China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five people were injured on the Chinese side in January by a stray artillery shell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live-fire drills would be held from Tuesday to Thursday in four locations including two in Ruili city, the Yunnan government said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The units will carry out armed patrols and joint air-ground patrols to test their ability to mobilise quickly, block and control and strike together, the southern command said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military previously held live-fire drills near the Myanmar border in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi said earlier this month that China “opposes chaos and war in Myanmar," according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing helped broker a cease-fire in Myanmar back in January, but that fell apart in June when one member of the Three Brotherhood Alliance launched new attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar issued a reminder this month to citizens in Shan State to strengthen their security precautions and stay away from conflict zones or return to China. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistani officials on Monday said at least 23 people were killed in a militant attack on a highway in southwestern Pakistan which targeted vehicles from buses to goods trucks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Armed men blocked the route in the province of Balochistan on Sunday night, took passengers off the vehicles, and shot them after checking their identity cards, a senior superintendent of police, Ayub Achakzai, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The armed men also not only killed passengers but also killed the drivers of trucks carrying coal," said Hameed Zahir, the deputy commissioner of the area where the incident occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 trucks were set on fire after their drivers had been killed, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants fighting a decades-old ethnic insurgency to demand the secession of resource-rich Balochistan from Pakistan have targeted workers from the eastern province of Punjab whom they see as exploiting their resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Balochistan Liberation Army group said its fighters had targeted military personnel travelling in civilian clothes, who were shot after being identified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's interior ministry said the dead were innocent citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack in a statement, vowing that security forces would retaliate and bring those responsible to justice. (Reuters)

    Australia gives workers the right to disconnect

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People can now "refuse to monitor, read, or respond to" their employers' attempts to contact them outside work hours. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767630_1_20240826094025.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia gave millions of workers the legal right to "disconnect" on Monday, allowing them to ignore unreasonable out-of-hours contact from employers, to the distress of big industry.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People can now "refuse to monitor, read, or respond to" their employers' attempts to contact them outside work hours -- unless that refusal is deemed "unreasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law is similar to legislation in some European and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unions welcomed the legislation, saying it gave workers a way to reclaim a level of work-life balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a historic day for working people," said Michele O'Neil, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The union movement has won the legal right for Australians to spend quality time with their loved ones without the stress of being forced to constantly answer unreasonable work calls and emails," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australian unions have reclaimed the right to knock off after work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the reforms got a cool welcome from Australian industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'right to disconnect' laws are rushed, poorly thought out and deeply confusing," the Australian Industry Group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the very least, employers and employees will now be uncertain about whether they can take or make a call out of hours to offer an extra shift," said the country's peak industry group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law, enacted in February, came into force for medium-sized and large companies as of Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smaller companies with fewer than 15 employees will be covered from August 26, 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We encourage workplace participants to educate themselves on the right to disconnect and take a common sense approach to applying it within their workplace," said the head of Australia's workplace relations regulator, Fair Work Ombudsman Anna Booth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the law, workers may be ordered by a tribunal to stop unreasonably refusing out-of-hours contact, and employers likewise may be ordered to stop unreasonably requiring employees to respond, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The question of what is reasonable will "depend on the circumstances", the Fair Work Ombudsman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deciding factors may include the reason for the contact, the nature of the employee's role, and their compensation for working extra hours or being available, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France introduced the right to disconnect in 2017, hoping to tackle the "always on" culture facilitated by smartphones and other digital devices. (AFP)

    UK mobile operator warns about smartphones for kids

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767599_1_20240826081103.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Britain's biggest mobile network operators said on Sunday it will warn parents they should not give smartphones to children under the age of 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents about the potential pitfalls of smartphone access for young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recent study by the UK communications regulator found around a quarter of British children aged between five and seven-years-old now had a smartphone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EE will say in new guidance that children should only be given phones with "limited capability devices" allowing them only to text and call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will also advise enabling parental control features for teens under the age of 16 and restrictions on social media for the under-13s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK parents have increasingly started to push back against the trend of giving children one of the devices when they transfer from primary to secondary school at the age of 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widely justified on safety grounds in case of an emergency on the way to or from school, parents fear the phones also potentially open children up to online predators, bullying, social pressure and harmful content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While technology and connectivity have the power to transform lives, we recognise the growing complexity of smartphones can be challenging for parents and caregivers," said Mat Sears, EE corporate affairs director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They need support, which is why we are launching new guidelines on smartphone usage for under 11s, 11 to 13-year-olds, and 13 to 16-year-olds to help them make the best choices for their children through these formative years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US author Jonathan Haidt -- whose recent book "The Anxious Generation" argued that smartphones have rewired children's brains -- has urged parents to act together on smartphone access so it becomes the norm for children not to have one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A child "breaks our heart" by telling us they are excluded from their peer group by being the only one without a phone, he said earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haidt advocates for no smart phones before the age of 14 or social media before 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These things are hard to do as one parent. But if we all do it together -- if even half of us do it together -- then it becomes much easier for our kids," he added. (AFP)

 Israeli jets launched strikes in Lebanon after the military assessed that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement was preparing to fire rockets and missiles towards Israel, the military said early on Sunday.

  "The IDF identified the Hezbollah terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory. In response to these threats, the IDF is striking terror targets in Lebanon," the Israel Defence Forces said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 French police arrested Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov on Saturday at an airport near Paris for alleged offences related to the popular messaging app, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Franco-Russian billionaire, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport north of the French capital on Saturday evening, one of the officials told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had just travelled from Baku, in Azerbaijan, another source close to the case said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov was expected to appear in court on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's OFMIN, an agency tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov as the coordinating agency in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, one of the sources close to the case said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov is suspected of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enough of Telegram's impunity," said one of the investigators, adding they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police were on Saturday hunting for a man who, draped in a Palestinian flag, was suspected of setting fires at a synagogue in southern France and triggering an explosion that injured a police officer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the incident was being treated as a potential terror attack and "all means" were being deployed to find the perpetrator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security around Jewish sites was tightened following the attack early on Saturday at Beth Yaacov synagogue in the seaside resort of La Grande Motte, near the city of Montpellier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two cars outside the synagogue were set alight, with a gas canister then likely exploding inside one of the vehicles, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two fires were also started at the entrance of the synagogue, but were quickly put out, with two doors damaged, investigators said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded police officer was injured by the blast after rushing to the scene after the fires were started, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron called the incident "an act of terror", adding on X that "the fight against anti-Semitism is a daily fight".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "all means are being deployed" to apprehend the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  La Grande Motte's mayor, Stephan Rossignol, said that CCTV had picked up images of an individual setting fire to the cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On part of the footage, seen and authenticated by AFP, a man is seen with a Palestinian flag draped around his waist, his head covered by a red Palestinian keffiyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man carried two bottles filled with a yellowish liquid. The footage also seems to show the contours of a handgun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources close to the investigation said the suspect left the scene hurriedly on foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fires and explosion come amid a heightened state of alert in France and other European countries because of the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said France's national anti-terror prosecutors had been tasked with probing the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "La Grande Motte's synagogue was the target of an attack this morning," Attal said in a post on X. "An anti-Semitic act. Once again, our Jewish fellow citizens are being targeted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin called the incident "an obviously criminal act".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "all means are being deployed to find the perpetrator".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police presence outside Jewish sites in France would be increased following the explosion, the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blast occurred during Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest that runs from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday, with many attending synagogue services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was, however, no religious service ongoing at the time of the incident, a police source said. A rabbi and four other people were inside the synagogue at the time but all were unharmed, investigators said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town of La Grande Motte has about 8,500 permanent residents but the population swells during the summer tourism season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Darmanin said this month that the government had counted 887 anti-Semitic acts in France in the first half of 2024, nearly three times as many as in the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France is home to the biggest Jewish population outside Israel and the United States, and also to the largest Muslim community in the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) called the explosion "an attempt to kill Jews".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The use of a gas canister "in a car at a time when worshippers are expected to arrive at the synagogue is not simply a criminal act", CRIF president Yonathan Arfi told AFP. "This shows an intention to kill." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two NASA astronauts who flew to the International Space Station in June aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule will need to return to Earth on a SpaceX vehicle early next year, NASA said on Saturday, deeming issues with Starliner's propulsion system too risky to carry its first crew home.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agency's decision, tapping Boeing's top space rival to return the astronauts, is one of NASA's most consequential in years. Boeing had hoped the test mission would redeem the Starliner program after years of development problems and over US$1.6 billion in budget overruns since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing is also struggling with quality issues on production of commercial planes, its most important products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both former military test pilots, became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Starliner's propulsion system suffered a series of glitches beginning in the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS, triggering months of cascading delays. Five of its 28 thrusters failed and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare reshuffling of NASA's astronaut operations, the two astronauts are now expected to return in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission. Two of the Crew Dragon's four astronaut seats will be kept empty for Wilmore and Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will undock from the ISS without a crew and attempt to return to Earth as it would have with astronauts aboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing struggled for years to develop Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule designed to compete with Crew Dragon as a second US option for sending astronaut crews to and from Earth's orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner failed a 2019 test to launch to the ISS uncrewed, but mostly succeeded in a 2022 do-over attempt where it also encountered thruster problems. Its June mission with its first crew was required before NASA can certify the capsule for routine flights, but now Starliner's crew certification path has been upended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Starliner docked to the ISS in June, Boeing has scrambled to investigate what caused its thruster mishaps and helium leaks. The company arranged tests and simulations on Earth to gather data that it has used to try and convince NASA officials that Starliner is safe to fly the crew back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But results from that testing raised more difficult engineering questions and ultimately failed to quell NASA officials' concerns about Starliner's ability to make its crewed return trip - the most daunting and complex part of the test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NASA's decision, and Starliner's now-uncertain path to certification, will add to the crises faced by new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who started this month with the goal to rebuild the planemaker's reputation after a door panel dramatically blew off a 737 MAX passenger jet in midair in January.

    Nasa to decide on Boeing Starliner ISS astronauts

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams originally planned to spend eight days at the International Space Station. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767470_1_20240824100555.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa is expected to decide Saturday whether two astronauts who arrived at the International Space Station aboard Boeing's Starliner should return on that craft -- or brace for a longer wait to fly home with rival SpaceX.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latter solution would not only create a fresh public relations headache for Boeing, but possibly result in astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams spending a total of eight months in orbit, not the eight days as originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A decision-making committee, with Nasa chief Bill Nelson sitting in, will meet Saturday to weigh the tough issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US space agency has tentatively scheduled a news conference for 1:00 pm (1700 GMT), presumably to announce its verdict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After years of Starliner development delays, the spacecraft finally lifted off in early June carrying Wilmore and Williams, both veteran astronauts, to the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule was originally set to bring them to Earth after eight days in space, but Nasa put their return on indefinite hold as it studied problems with the craft's propulsion system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa officials are weighing the highly unusual option of bringing the two astronauts back from the flying laboratory not on their own craft, but aboard a previously scheduled SpaceX vehicle in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engineers at Boeing and Nasa have spent weeks conducting intensive tests on the Starliner's systems, trying to get to the root of the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their worry is that the craft might not have the propulsive power to wrest itself out of orbit and begin the descent toward Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Nasa experts decide the Starliner is not safe, the craft would return without any passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SpaceX Crew-9 mission would then take off in late September, but carrying only two passengers instead of the originally planned four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would remain moored to the ISS until its scheduled return in February, bringing back its own crew members plus their two stranded colleagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an approach would be a stinging blow to the already tarnished image of US giant Boeing, whose airplane arm has been beset in recent years with concerns about safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten years ago, following the retirement of the Space Shuttle, Nasa ordered new vessels from both Boeing and SpaceX that could ferry astronauts to and from the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With two such vehicles available, Nasa reasoned, there would always be a backup in case one of the two experienced problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Elon Musk's SpaceX beat Boeing to the punch and has been the lone vehicle used to taxi astronauts for the past four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's crewed Starliner flight, which followed years of delays and disappointments during the craft's development, was meant to be a last test of the vehicle before it enters regular operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa has said the astronauts on the ISS have plenty of supplies, are trained for extended stays and have plenty of experiments to conduct. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Emergency services at the scene of the attack in Solingen. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767456_1_20240824063306.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people were killed and four severely wounded in a knife attack at a festival in the western German city of Solingen on Friday, according to a spokeswoman for the police in nearby Duesseldorf.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police have launched a "major operation" to find the suspect, who is on the run, the spokeswoman said, adding that a "wide area" had been cordoned off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were at the scene with helicopters and emergency vehicles, and had asked the public to avoid the area, according to the broadcaster ZDF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival was part of a series of events to celebrate the city's 650th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted online, Tim-Oliver Kurzbach, the mayor of Solingen, said the whole city was in "shock, horror and great grief".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all wanted to celebrate our town's anniversary together and now we have to mourn the dead and injured," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kurzbach thanked the emergency services for their work at the scene and expressed sympathy with those who had witnessed the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It tears my heart apart that there was an attack on our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we have lost. I pray for all those who are still fighting for their lives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solingen is a city of some 150,000 people located an equal distance from Duesseldorf and Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People had gathered in the town on Friday evening for the first day of a three-day "Festival of Diversity", according to the event's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival was set to feature music, street theatre, variety shows and comedians in the city centre and several other areas, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to 75,000 visitors were expected to attend over the three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Solinger Tageblatt newspaper reported that one of the co-organisers of the festival had come on stage to cancel the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd were also asked to leave the city centre, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the announcement, thousands of attendees cleared the area, the paper reported, with a journalist at the scene describing the atmosphere as "ghostly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People left the scene in shock, but calmly," Philipp Mueller, one of the organisers, told the newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness who spoke to the Tageblatt said he was a few metres from the attack, not far from the stage, and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," said the man, Lars Breitzke, who at first thought it was someone who was drunk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground and several pools of blood, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has seen a series of knife attacks over the past 12 months, with Interior Minister Nancy Faeser promising to crack down on knife crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police officer was killed and five people were wounded in a knife attack at a far-right rally in the city of Mannheim in late May. (AFP)

    Independent Kennedy drops US poll bid, backs Trump

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Robert F Kennedy Jr announces that he's dropping his presidential run. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767443_1_20240824033757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, likely ending a presidential bid that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His campaign indicated that he feared staying in the race would siphon support from former President Trump, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy drawing the support of 20 percent of Americans in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, US President John F Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family, who condemned his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy said on Wednesday. He also wanted Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had "so many skeletons in my closet" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And then there was the brain worm. Kennedy had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, a fact unearthed by the New York Times and confirmed by the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those stories prompted ridicule from late-night talk show hosts. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Narendra Modi is greeted by Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the Indian leader makes a historic visit to Kyiv. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767440_1_20240824015244.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi urged President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday to sit down for talks with Russia to end the war in Ukraine and offered to act as a friend to help bring peace as the two leaders met in wartime Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history comes at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in Februaru 2022, with Moscow making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The optics closely resembled the Indian leader's visit to Moscow last month where he called for peace and embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, angering Ukraine where a Russian missile strike hit a children's hospital on the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The road to resolution can only be found through dialogue and diplomacy. And we should move in that direction without wasting any time. Both sides should sit together to find a way out of this crisis," Modi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to assure you that India is ready to play an active role in any efforts towards peace. If I can play any role in this personally, I will do that, I want to assure you as a friend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what Kyiv made of his remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India, which traditionally has close economic and defence ties with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war, but also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both leaders described Modi's visit as "historic" in their statements, in which Modi spoke second and Zelenskiy did not have an opportunity to respond to the call for dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskiy said that "the matter of ending the war and a just peace are the priority for Ukraine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that talks were out of the question after Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An aide to former British PM Rishi Sunak was among those accused of placing bets on the election date. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767438_1_20240824011046.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police announced on Friday that a probe into betting on the date of the last general election had ended, saying the bar for misconduct had not been met.
 <br>
  <br/>
  London's Metropolitan Police said in late June it would investigate a "small number" of bets placed on the timing of last month's elections, as part of a joint probe with the gambling watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scandal overshadowed the latter stages of campaigning ahead of the July 5 poll, after it emerged senior Conservative officials and one of then-prime minister Rishi Sunak's aides had placed bets shortly before he announced the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met also arrested one of its officers on suspicion of misconduct in public office over election betting claims, while six other officers were identified as having placed bets on its date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission launched an investigation into whether any broke laws on "cheating" while the Met opened a separate inquiry into whether other criminal offences had been committed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While political bets are allowed in the UK, using insider knowledge to make them is against the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Britain's biggest police force announced its criminal investigation had concluded with no action being taken, including against the officer who had been arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met said the "high bar" for proving misconduct in public office had not been met, following advice from the country's prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission investigation remains ongoing and could still result in criminal charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile the Met's internal watchdog unit is continuing to investigate the seven officers alleged to have placed bets on the election date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These allegations caused a significant dent in public confidence during the election campaign and it was right that they were investigated to explore all possible offences," Detective Superintendent Katherine Goodwin said in a statement. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 14 people were killed, 16 others injured and several more believed to be missing after a bus carrying dozens of Indian pilgrims drove off a key highway on Friday in Nepal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials said the bus veered off Prithvi Highway and rolled towards a fast-flowing river, stopping on the rocky bank just shy of the rushing, murky water. The top part of the bus was ripped, but the wreckage did not plunge into the Marsyangdi River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An armed police spokesperson said that, among those pulled out of from the bus, 14 were declared dead and 16 were injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials could not yet say how many more were missing or the exact number of people on the bus when it crashed, but they estimated there were some four dozen on board at the time of the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police and army rescuers were helping to pull people from the wreckage near Abukhaireni, a town about 120 kilometres west of the capital, Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bus from neighbouring Indian town of Gorakhpur was heading toward Kathmandu from the resort town of Pokhara on Friday when it drove off the highway midway in the journey.

  In July, two buses were swept by landslides not too far from Friday's accident site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 65 people on board those two buses, only three survived and only about half the bodies were recovered. The wreckage of those buses have not been found yet but authorities have continued to search.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bus accidents in Nepal are mostly due to poorly maintained roads and vehicles and much of the country is covered by mountains with narrow roads. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Kamala Harris called on Americans to join her to “chart a new way forward” as she accepted the Democratic nomination on Thursday, arguing her personal story and her career as a prosecutor made her uniquely qualified to protect their interests and beat Republican candidate Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking the stage to a thunderous standing ovation at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Harris sought to introduce herself to the American public and outline her vision for leading the nation for the next four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' address in Chicago caps a whirlwind eight weeks in American politics and manifests the stunning reversal of Democratic fortunes just 75 days until Election Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party leaders who had publicly despaired over President Joe Biden's candidacy after his disastrous debate against Trump in June, were jubilant both at the historic nature of Harris' candidacy which has boosted their hopes for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Harris became the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to accept a major party's presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If elected, she would become the first female US president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected. But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris talked about being raised primarily by her mother in San Francisco's East Bay after her parents divorced, and being raised as well by friends and caregivers who were “family by love.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also detailed a key part of her political origin story, when Wanda, her best friend from high school, confided in her that she was being abused by her stepfather and came to live with Harris' family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor. To protect people like Wanda,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outlining her career as a prosecutor, state attorney general, senator and now vice president, Harris said, “My entire career I’ve only had one client: the people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said Trump has only ever acted in the interests of "the only client he has ever had: himself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she took the stage, she saw a sea of female delegates and Democratic supporters wearing white — the colour of women’s suffrage — the movement that culminated with American women securing the right to vote in 1920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris also pledged to get a Gaza ceasefire deal completed and said as US president she would stand with Ukraine and not "cozy up" to dictators like Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done." (Agencies)

    Canada to order rail companies to resume operations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Canadian government moved quickly on Thursday to end an unprecedented rail stoppage, announcing it would ask the country's industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order that could come in a few days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Canada's top two railroads had locked out more than 9,000 unionised workers earlier in the day, triggering a simultaneous rail stoppage that business groups said could inflict hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon told reporters he was acting "to ensure that the activities of both of these rail companies immediately resume" and said he was referring the matter to the board for binding arbitration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MacKinnon said he was confident the board would issue a back-to-work order within the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I assume that the trains will be running within days," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The companies – Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City – and the Teamsters union blamed each other for the work stoppage after multiple rounds of talks failed to yield an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision marked a change of mind by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which had long made clear its desire to see the matter settled at the bargaining table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We gave negotiations every possible opportunity to succeed ... but we have an impasse here," said MacKinnon. "And that is why we have come to this decision today." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities confirmed late on Thursday that five Chinese nationals were among nine people who died when a small plane crashed minutes after taking off from Bangkok’s main airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media reports in Thailand say the dead included children aged 12 and 13, as well as three adults in their 40s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other four victims were Thai nationals, including two pilots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok said Thai authorities had confirmed the death of five Chinese nationals, and it was seeking further information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Immigration Department said no SAR residents were involved in the tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports say the jet took off from Bangkok’s main Suvarnabhumi Airport at 2.46pm. Air traffic control lost radio and radar contact with the aircraft 11 minutes later, when it was an estimated 35 kilometres southeast of the airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thai media said rescuers found no survivors at the crash site in a mangrove swamp in Chachoengsao province about 40 kilometres from the airport. Rescue teams continued their work into the night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cessna Caravan C208B operated by the Thai Flying Service Company had been bound for the coastal province of Krabi. (Additional reporting by AP, Xinhua)

    US top court revives Arizona voter rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The US Supreme Court voted to reinstate Arizona's voting rules in part. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767277_1_20240823034309.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court on Thursday revived part of an Arizona voter law requiring documented proof of US citizenship to register to vote, in response to a request from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republicans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The justices in a 5-4 ruling agreed to reinstate a provision of the law after a federal judge blocked it in response to legal challenges by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration and advocacy groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision comes before the November 5 election in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is facing off against Republican former President Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arizona's Republican-controlled legislature adopted new restrictions on voter registration in 2022. The law requires applicants who submit a federal registration form to provide evidence of US citizenship to vote in presidential elections or vote by mail in any federal election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voter registrants who use a separate, state-created form face even tighter restrictions. Without proof of US citizenship, state applications are rejected in their entirety, and officials who fail to do so face a minor felony charge under the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court's ruling revived the restriction related to the state voter registration form, but kept intact a judicial decision blocking the provision that sought to tighten limits on the federal form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts joined with fellow conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch to grant Republicans' request in part, though Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the entire request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, would have denied the request in full. (Reuters)

    Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767274_1_20240823013000.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal on Thursday ratified President Nicolas Maduro's victory in the July 28 presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The supreme tribunal has reviewed material from the electoral authority and agrees that Maduro won the election, court president Caryslia Rodriguez said, adding the decision cannot be appealed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The electoral material assessed is certified unobjectionably and the results of the presidential election of July 28 released by the national electoral council, where Nicolas Maduro was elected president of the republic, are validated," said Rodriguez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electoral authority has said since the night of the election that Maduro won just over half of votes, though it has not published full tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has published online what it says are 83 percent of voting machine tallies, which give its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez a hearty 67 percent support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Western countries have urged full publication of results, while Russia, China and others have congratulated Maduro on his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme court would be in violation of separation of powers rules in the constitution if it were to carry out any electoral functions, thus making its ruling null, the opposition said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ratification gives Maduro, who took office in 2013, another six-year term, set to begin in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president, a long-time ruling party official before he rose to the presidency, had asked the court to verify the results. The court's judges summoned all the candidates to hand over the copies of voting machine tallies they are entitled to by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez did not attend the summons. The opposition says the court, though constitutionally independent, operates as an arm of the ruling party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition's failure to hand over its copies and Gonzalez's non-appearance are "blatant disrespect", Rodriguez said, and exposes him to sanctions, though she did not specify what kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 23 protesters have been killed at anti-government demonstrations since the election, and some 2,400 arrested, according to the United Nations. Maduro says the demonstrators are extremists. (Reuters)

    Indonesia shelves elections shake-up amid protests

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767270_1_20240822233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's parliament shelved planned changes to electoral laws on Thursday after protesters in the capital set fires and faced down tear gas and water cannon over legislation they say would weaken opponents of the outgoing president and his successor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislature, dominated by supporters of outgoing President Joko Widodo and his successor, Prabowo Subianto, was scheduled to vote to reverse changes to election laws made by the constitutional court, a ruling that effectively reopened a chance for a vocal government critic to run in regional elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties backing Prabowo had earlier this week rallied behind a single candidate for the influential post of Jakarta governor, killing off chances of the president-elect's rival, Anies Baswedan, from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anies at the time needed the backing from a party or a coalition of parties with at least 20 percent of seats in the local parliament, under rules for regional elections in place since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tuesday's Constitutional Court ruling had lowered the threshold to under 10 percent, giving Anies a chance to be nominated by the only party that has not named a candidate, PDIP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national parliament had sought to return to the previous threshold, contradicting the country's highest court in a move critics said would favour the outgoing president and his family, and the incoming government, as they consolidate power and freeze out any opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a republic. It's a democracy, but if its leadership is decided by one person, or an oligarchy, we can't accept that," said 29-year-old teacher Afif Sidik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, deputy parliament speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad said that deliberations would be resumed by the incoming parliament, meaning there would be no change for this year's regional elections, scheduled for November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means Anies will be able to seek the Jakarta governor's office if PDIP nominates him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parliament decision came as security forces fired tear gas and water cannon as protesters breached and set ablaze part of the gates of parliament, while demonstrations broke out across the country against the election law changes. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at a hotel in South Korea has killed seven people and injured 12 others, fire authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fire began on the eighth floor of the nine-story hotel in Bucheon, just west of the capital Seoul at around 7.40pm on Thursday, before being put out in about two hours, according to the interior ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven people died, mostly guests, and 12 were sent to hospitals for treatment, including three in critical condition, said Lee Sang-don, an official at the Bucheon fire station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those killed were a couple who jumped out the windows onto an air mattress installed in front of the building, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was unfolded normally but appeared to have flipped over when they jumped down," he told a televised briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities were looking into the exact cause of the incident, adding there were no sprinklers inside, which was not mandatory when the building was completed in 2003, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Lee Sang-min ordered all-out rescue efforts by mobilising all available resources, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 70 vehicles and 160 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, Yonhap news agency said, citing provincial fire authorities.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Italian coast guard on Thursday said the body of British tech magnate Mike Lynch was among those recovered off the coast of Sicily from the wreckage of a superyacht.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One woman remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies of Lynch, who had been celebrating his recent acquittal on fraud charges with his family and the people who had defended him at trial in the United States, and five others were recovered by rescue crews following Monday's tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bayesian, a 56-metre British-flagged yacht, went down in a storm early Monday as it was moored about a kilometre offshore. Civil protection officials said they believe the ship was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, and sank quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators are now looking at why the Bayesian sank, killing at least six people. A seventh remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen of the 22 people aboard survived, including a mother who reported holding her one-year-old baby over the waves to save her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divers have struggled to find the bodies in the yacht’s hull on the seabed 50 metres underwater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would need a crystal ball to know when we'll be able to find the next body," said Luca Cari, spokesperson for the fire rescue service.

  “It's very difficult to move inside the wreckage. Moving just one metre can take up to 24 hours,” Cari said. (AP)

 Tim Walz formally accepted his nomination to be the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate in a keynote address on Wednesday at the party's convention in Chicago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It's the honour of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States. We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason -- we love this country," Walz said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Minnesota governor, who was little known in America 15 days ago, acknowledged he had never given such a big speech but said that as a former high school football coach, "I have given a lot of pep talks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd responded with chants of "Coach, Coach, Coach!" Walz brought his plain-speaking style and small-town values to the national stage, joined by a litany of political luminaries and star entertainers on the third night of the Democratic National Convention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said America should be a place where children don't go hungry, healthcare and housing are human rights, "and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom," referring to Republican assaults on abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He spoke of preserving the freedoms that Democrats say are under attack from Trump, who is making his third major-party run for the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said a second Trump White House would serve nobody except the wealthy and most extreme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kamala Harris will address the gathering on its final night on Thursday when she will accept her party's nomination for president. (Agencies)
