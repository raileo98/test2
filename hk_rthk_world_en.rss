<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Preliminary results on Monday showed Claudia Sheinbaum was elected Mexico's first woman president by a landslide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Electoral Institute announced after a quick count that Sheinbaum won around 58 to 60 percent of the vote, more than 30 percentage points ahead of her main opposition rival Xochitl Galvez, also a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory for Sheinbaum was a major step for Mexico, a country known for its macho culture and home to the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, which for years pushed more traditional values and roles for women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum was also the first woman to win a general election in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election was also the biggest in the country’s history. More than 20,000 congressional and local positions were up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum has a complicated path ahead. She must balance promises to increase popular welfare policies while inheriting a hefty budget deficit and low economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has vowed to improve security but has given few details while the election was the most violent in Mexico's modern history with 38 candidates murdered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many analysts say organised crime groups expanded and deepened their influence during outgoing President Lopez Obrador's term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More people have been killed - over 185,000 - during the mandate of Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico's modern history, although the homicide rate has been inching down. (Agencies)

    Trump warns jail time could be 'breaking point'

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Donald Trump says he is "not sure the public would stand for it" if he is given a custodial sentence. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755828_1_20240603023212.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has warned that it could prove to be a "breaking point" for his supporters if he is sentenced to prison or house arrest following his historic criminal conviction.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview aired on Sunday on Fox News, the former president and current Republican White House hopeful acknowledged the possibility that he could be handed jail time or a period of home detention at his sentencing on July 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm ok with it," Trump said, but added he was "not sure the public would stand for it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it would be tough for the public to take. You know at a certain point there's a breaking point," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The warning will resonate in a country already concerned about the prospect of political violence in the increasingly heated run-up to the November 5 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump will now be running as a convicted felon, and he has repeatedly made it clear he will not accept the result should he lose to President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A New York jury on Thursday convicted Trump on all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in the final stages of the 2016 presidential campaign to cover up a sex scandal involving adult film star Stormy Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first criminal conviction of a former president in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although each charge carries a possible four-year jail term, experts say it is extremely unlikely that the judge will actually hand down a custodial sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump faces three other criminal trials, including one related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election he lost to Biden. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexicans voted on Sunday in a presidential election dominated by two women – an historic first in a country with a history of gender-based violence and discrimination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of troops were expected to be deployed to protect voters, following a particularly bloody electoral process that has seen more than two dozen aspiring local politicians murdered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruling party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum, a former Mexico City mayor and a scientist by training, had a 17 percentage point lead over her main opposition rival Xochitl Galvez on the eve of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only man running, centrist Jorge Alvarez Maynez, was trailing far behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means that, barring a huge surprise, a woman is almost certain to break the highest political glass ceiling in Mexico, where around 10 women or girls are murdered every day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A female president will be a transformation for this country, and we hope that she does more for women," said Clemencia Hernandez, a 55-year-old cleaner in Mexico City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many women are subjugated by their partners. They're not allowed to leave home to work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mariana Nieves, a 28-year-old designer, said a lot of younger Mexicans were fed up with politicians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we have to vote because we're hopeful of something good for Mexico in security, education. I'm happy that a woman is going to win but I'm not very excited because I think neither of them has coherent proposals" on improving women's rights, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 100 million people were registered to vote in the world's most populous Spanish-speaking country, home to 129 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum, 61, owes much of her popularity to outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a fellow leftist and mentor who has an approval rating of more than 60 percent but is only allowed to serve one term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a nation where politics, crime and corruption are closely entangled, ultra-violent drug cartels have gone to extreme lengths to ensure that their preferred candidates win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours before polls opened, a local candidate was murdered in a violent western state, authorities said, joining at least 25 other political hopefuls killed this election season, according to official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel Delgado, 35, was shot on Saturday night near his home, the Michoacan state prosecutor's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another sign of the difficulties of staging elections in cartel hotspots, voting was suspended in two southern municipalities because of violence, local authorities said on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fight against organised crime will be the biggest challenge for the next president," said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University, in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security was the weakest point of Lopez Obrador's administration, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum has pledged to continue the outgoing president's controversial "hugs not bullets" strategy of tackling crime at its roots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Galvez has vowed a tougher approach to cartel-related violence, declaring "hugs for criminals are over."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 450,000 people have been murdered and tens of thousands have gone missing since the government deployed the army to fight drug trafficking in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next president will also have to manage delicate relations with the neighbouring United States, in particular the vexed issues of cross-border drug smuggling and migration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing a cheering crowd of thousands at her closing campaign rally, Sheinbaum said Mexico was going to "make history" this weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I say to the young women, to all the women of Mexico – colleagues, friends, sisters, daughters, mothers and grandmothers – you are not alone," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ruling party candidate had the backing of 53 percent of voters as campaigning drew to a close, according to a poll average compiled by research firm Oraculus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Galvez, an outspoken senator and businesswoman with Indigenous roots, was second with 36 percent. Maynez, 38, had just 11 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Galvez, 61, often evokes her childhood story of growing up in a poor, rural town in central Mexico where she says she sold candy to help her family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While you danced ballet at the age of 10, I had to work," she told Sheinbaum, a former student activist who was born in the capital to a family of Jewish immigrants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While millions of Mexicans have escaped poverty in recent years, more than a third still live below the poverty line in Latin America's second-biggest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as voting for a new president, Mexicans will choose members of Congress, several state governors and myriad local officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, more than 20,000 positions are being contested. (AFP)

    Indonesia arrests 'most wanted' Thai fugitive

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian police have arrested one of Thailand's "most wanted" fugitives who was on the run after escaping custody in Thailand last year, a senior police official said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chaowalit Thongduang, 37, was arrested in the Indonesian resort island of Bali on Thursday, said Wahyu Widada, the head of Indonesia's criminal investigation agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fugitive who was secured is one of the most wanted fugitives by Thailand authorities because (he) had committed many crimes before eventually fleeing to Indonesia to hide," Wahyu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chaowalit, also known by the moniker "Pang Na Node," was wanted on multiple charges including murder and drug-related offences, according to Phanurat Lukboon, secretary general of Thailand's narcotics control board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He entered Indonesia in December 2023 after a 17-hour journey by speedboat, Wahyu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that police seized several pieces of evidence, including a fake identity card and birth certificate under the name of Sulaiman, which was allegedly used by Chaowalit, and an Indonesian bank account book.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phanurat thanked Indonesia for arresting Chaowalit, adding that Thai authorities are further investigating the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When Chaowalit comes here, there must be someone who helped him enter Indonesia. Now we are investigating to know who is the mastermind behind all this," Phanurat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chaowalit escaped from a hospital in southern Nakhon Si Thammarat province while he was serving a 20-year sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December last year, the Bangkok Post reported that he had been sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment in an attempted murder case dating back to 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of police officers were mobilised to recapture him, in an operation reported to have cost around 10 million baht (US$271,816).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chaowalit is expected to be extradited to Thailand on Tuesday, said Krishna Murti, who heads the Indonesian police's international relations division. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Political parties will have two weeks to work out a deal before a new parliament sits to choose a president.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official results from South Africa's election were expected to confirm on Sunday the end of the African National Congress' 30 years of majority governing and start the clock on a race to form a new ruling coalition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Voters, angry at joblessness, inequality and power shortages, slashed support for the ANC – the former liberation movement of the late Nelson Mandela – to 40 percent in Wednesday's election, down from 57.5 percent in the 2019 parliamentary vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means it must now share power, likely with a major political rival, in order to keep it – an unprecedented prospect since the end of white minority rule in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the official announcement of results expected on Sunday evening, political parties will have two weeks to work out a deal before a new parliament sits to choose a president, who would likely still emerge from the ANC as the biggest party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ANC is committed to the formation of a government that reflects the will of the people, that is stable and that is able to govern effectively," Fikile Mbalula, the party's secretary general, said at a press briefing on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the ANC would be having discussions both internally and with other parties to create national and provisional governments "that reflect the will of the people and that are able to take the country forward".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said that the ANC would not bend to pressure from other parties that incumbent President Cyril Ramaphosa must step down as a condition for forming a coalition. "That is a no-go area," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC's performance has fuelled speculation that Ramaphosa's days might be numbered, either due to the potential demands of a prospective coalition partner or as a result of an internal leadership challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Counting from the May 29 poll was almost complete on Sunday morning, with results in from 99.9 percent of polling stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Wednesday, the ANC had won every national election by a landslide since 1994, but over the last decade its support has dwindled as the economy stagnated, unemployment rose and roads and power stations crumbled. (Reuters)

    Heatstroke kills 33 Indian polling staff

    <![CDATA[<img alt="There have been reports of multiple deaths from the intense heatwave – with temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius in many places. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755785_1_20240602155407.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 33 Indian polling staff died on the last day of voting from heatstroke in just one state, a top election official said on Sunday, after scorching temperatures gripped swathes of the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While there have been reports of multiple deaths from the intense heatwave – with temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius in many places – the dozens of staff dying in one day marks an especially grim toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The India Meteorological Department said temperatures at Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh reached 46.9 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Navdeep Rinwa, chief electoral officer for the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where voting in the seventh and final stage of elections ended on Saturday, said 33 polling personnel died due to the heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure included security guards and sanitation staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A monetary compensation of 1.5 million rupees (US$18,000) will be provided to the families of the deceased," Rinwa told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts say that when a person is dehydrated, extreme heat exposure thickens their blood and causes organs to shut down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rinwa reported a separate incident in which a man queueing to vote in the city of Ballia lost consciousness while waiting in line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The voter was transported to a health facility, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival," Rinwa said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India is no stranger to searing summer temperatures, but years of scientific research have found climate change is causing heatwaves to last longer, and be more frequent and more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hindu-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks set to win a third straight landslide election victory after voting ended on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exit polls showed he was well on track to triumph and Modi himself was certain he had prevailed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results will be formally announced on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 New York police arrested at least 22 people after pro-Palestinian protesters picketed New York's Brooklyn Museum, charging some with offenses including assault, officers said on Saturday, with the gallery reporting damage to artwork.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of demonstrators had descended on the art museum on Friday, chanting pro-Palestinian slogans, and carrying banners and placards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While many remained outside, some entered the museum, with a giant black and white banner reading "Free Palestine, divest from genocide" unfurled above the museum facade's six distinctive columns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested were accused of offences ranging from assaulting police officers, resisting arrest and riding a bicycle on the sidewalk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lesser action was taken against seven others, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, there was damage to existing and newly installed artwork on our plaza, and our public safety staff were physically and verbally harassed," said a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Museum, confirming that the site was closed early on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US universities were rocked by pro-Palestinian demonstrations in April, triggering campus clashes with police and the arrest of dozens of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations began at Columbia University in New York and later spread across the country as well as to Europe and elsewhere. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea has sent around 600 more trash-filled balloons containing everything from cigarette butts to plastic across the border, Seoul's military said on Sunday, adding that security personnel were collecting them as they landed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "North Korea has resumed launching waste balloons towards South Korea," since around 8pm Saturday evening, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of around 10am Sunday, "approximately 600 balloons have been identified, with about 20 to 50 balloons per hour moving through the air," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The balloons are landing in South Korea's northern provinces, including the capital Seoul and the adjacent area of Gyeonggi, which collectively are home to nearly half of the South's population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea began sending hundreds of balloons carrying bags of trash earlier this week, which Seoul has slammed as "low-class", warning of strong countermeasures unless Pyongyang stops such "irrational" provocations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the campaign started on Tuesday, some 900 balloons have been launched, the JCS said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far, they have been found to contain "waste such as cigarette butts, scrap paper, fabric pieces, and plastic," it said, adding that "no hazardous substances have been found."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our military is conducting surveillance and reconnaissance from the launch points of the balloons, tracking them through aerial reconnaissance, and collecting the fallen debris, prioritising public safety," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We urge the public to avoid contact with the fallen waste balloons and report them to the nearest military unit or police station," it added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters in Tel Aviv are hoping the Israeli government will accept President Biden's proposal. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755749_1_20240602042102.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two far-right Israeli ministers threatened on Saturday to quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau's government if he goes ahead with a hostage release deal outlined by US President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden said on Friday that Israel had offered a new roadmap towards a full ceasefire including the release of hostages held by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said they would quit his government if the deal went ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir said his party would "dissolve the government" if the deal went through and slammed the proposal as "a victory for terrorism and a security risk to the State of Israel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Agreeing to such a deal is not total victory – but total defeat," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smotrich said he would "not be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We demand the continuation of the war until Hamas is destroyed and all hostages return," Smotrich said on X, adding that he opposes the return of displaced Gazans to the territory's north and the "wholesale release of terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Saturday, Netanyahu insisted that the destruction of Hamas was part of the Israeli plan laid out by Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid vowed to offer Netanyahu "our safety net for a hostage deal if Ben Gvir and Smotrich leave the government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without Ben Gvir's and Smotrich's parties, Netanyahu's coalition could lose its majority in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of Israelis meanwhile rallied in Tel Aviv to demand acceptance of the ceasefire and hostage release deal outlined by Biden, with many fearing the premier would disown the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope that somehow Biden puts enough pressure so the government and Netanyahu will take the deal," said protester Diti Kapuano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 36,379 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israeli bombardments and ground offensive since October 7, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run territory. (AFP)

    Election in Mexico already deadliest in recent history

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ruling party hopeful Claudia Sheinbaum is widely expected to win Sunday's vote and become Mexico's first female president. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755746_2_20240602024144.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexico's election is now the bloodiest in its modern history after a candidate running for local office in central Puebla state was murdered on Friday at a political rally, taking the number of assassinated candidates to 37 ahead of Sunday's vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jorge Huerta Cabrera, a candidate who was running for a council seat in the town of Izucar de Matamoros, was gunned down in the attack, according to the state prosecutor's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing takes the number of assassinated candidates in the 2024 election season to 37, one more than during the 2021 midterm election when 36 candidates were killed, according to data from security consultancy Integralia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of violent crime has emerged as one of the top issues in this year's presidential contest, in which the ruling party of outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been forced to defend a persistently high murder rate, as the opposition has sought to use the bloodshed to argue for change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruling party hopeful Claudia Sheinbaum is widely expected to win Sunday's vote and become Mexico's first female president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's possible that violence is being used as a means to define the election in advance, particularly when certain interests are perceived to be at risk in the event that a particular political project triumphs," said Armando Vargas, an Integralia researcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultancy has also counted 828 non-lethal attacks on candidates during the current election season, up from 749 since just Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts point to Mexico's mix of powerful drug cartels and often corrupt local governments as contributing to the dangers faced by candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, a local mayoral candidate in southern Guerrero state was gunned down at point-blank range during a campaign rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was among 560 candidates and election officials who have been given security guards by the government due to persistent threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's grisly assassination was captured on video, with mayhem erupting at the rally after the shots rang out. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A last-minute problem nixed Saturday’s launch attempt for Boeing’s first astronaut flight, the latest in a string of delays over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two Nasa astronauts were strapped into the company’s Starliner capsule when the countdown was automatically halted at 3 minutes and 50 seconds by the computer system that controls the final minutes before lift off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With only a split second to take off, there was no time to work on the latest issue and everything was called off. It was not immediately clear why the computers aborted the countdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launch controllers were evaluating the data, said United Launch Alliance’s Dillon Rice. But it is possible the team could try again as soon as Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams remained in their capsule seats, as they waited for technicians to help them get out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first launch attempt on May 6 was delayed for leak checks and rocket repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa wants a backup to SpaceX, which has been flying its astronauts for four years. (AP)

    South Africa's ANC loses majority, needs allies

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cyril Ramaphosa's ANC has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755735_1_20240601214128.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC faced a search for allies to help it form a new government on Saturday after it lost its three-decade-old absolute majority in a watershed election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With 99 percent of the votes from Wednesday's election counted, President Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress had only 40 percent, a catastrophic slump from the 57.5 it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks an historic turning point for South Africa as the party has enjoyed an absolute majority since 1994, when liberation leader Nelson Mandela led the nation out of white-minority rule and into democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC must now either negotiate a coalition government, or at least persuade other parties to back Ramaphosa's re-election in parliament to allow him to form a minority government reliant on other parties for support to pass budgets and legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been talking with everybody even before the election," ANC's deputy secretary general Nomvula Mokonyane said, saying the party's NEC decision-making body would meet to decide on a course of action after final results are announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's about ensuring that the stability both in government and stability in our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She would not be drawn on whether the party might replace Ramaphosa after the party's record poor showing, saying: "For now, it's not an issue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As votes continued to be validated, data from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) showed the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) held second place with 21.71 percent, slightly up on its 20.77 showing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party, which governs Western Cape province and has promised a free market agenda at odds with the ANC's left-wing traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the chances of a coalition with the ANC, Helen Zille, the DA party chairwoman, said: "Negotiations haven't started but some channels have been opened, individuals talking to individuals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also did not rule out allowing the ANC to attempt to rule alone, saying: "A minority government would be something completely new in South Africa but it is an option amongst others."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was not a surge by the DA that cut into the ANC's vote share.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In third place was former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) on 12.6 percent, a surprise score for a party founded just months ago as a vehicle for the former ANC chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was in fourth with 9.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malema and Zuma are former ANC members and some observers have suggested that they would be more natural partners for the ruling coalition, a prospect that the DA has branded the "Doomsday Coalition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other analysts, including author Susan Booysen, said the EFF was perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma – who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018 – was "too far reaching" to mend, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MK spokesman Nhlamulo Ndhlela seemed to agree. "We will engage with the ANC but not the ANC of Cyril Ramaphosa," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any coalition partner should be willing to amend the constitution to enact radical reforms and grant Zuma, who has been declared ineligible over a contempt of court conviction, a pardon, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC retains the loyalty of many voters for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs. (AFP)

    India's six-week election ends with vote in holy city

    <![CDATA[<img alt="India has voted in seven phases over six weeks to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755734_1_20240601213025.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's marathon election drew to a close on Saturday six weeks after voting began, with voters enduring a scorching heatwave to cast their ballots in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long been widely expected to win a third term when results are announced on Tuesday, in large part due to his cultivated image as an aggressive champion of India's majority faith.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exit polls – though historically unreliable at capturing voter shifts in an election with 968 million eligible voters – are expected to give some initial indication of whether he has succeeded later on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many in the 73-year-old premier's constituency of Varanasi were eager for that to be the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I voted for growth and development of my country," said local resident Brijesh Taksali outside a polling station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's only one leader that I know... Narendra Modi. I voted for him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varanasi is the spiritual capital of the Hindu faith, where devotees from around India come to cremate deceased loved ones by the Ganges river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is one of the final cities to vote in India's gruelling election, and where public support for Modi's ever-closer alignment of religion and politics burns brightest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi has already led the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to two landslide victories in 2014 and 2019, forged in large part by his appeal to the Hindu faithful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, Modi presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque in Ayodhya razed by Hindu zealots in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction of the temple fulfilled a longstanding demand of Hindu activists and was widely celebrated across the country with back-to-back television coverage and street parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony, and numerous other chest-beating demonstrations of fidelity to India's majority religion over the past decade, have made many among the country's 200 million-plus minority Muslim community increasingly uneasy about their futures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi himself has made a number of strident comments about Muslims on the campaign trail, referring to them as "infiltrators."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has also accused the motley coalition of more than two dozen opposition parties contesting the poll against him of plotting to redistribute India's wealth to its Muslim citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Janesar Akhtar, a Muslim clothesmaker working in Varanasi's famed embroidery workshops, said that the BJP's sectarian campaigning was an unfortunate distraction from India's chronic unemployment problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Workshops here are closing down and the Modi government has been busy with the politics of temples and mosques," the 44-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is supposed to give us jobs and not tensions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have long expected Modi to triumph against the opposition alliance, which at no point has named an agreed candidate for prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His prospects have been further bolstered by several criminal probes into his opponents and a tax investigation this year that froze the bank accounts of Congress, India's largest opposition party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western democracies have largely sidestepped concerns over rights and democratic freedoms in the hopes of cultivating an ally that can help check the growing assertiveness of China, India's northern neighbour and rival regional power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's image at home has been bolstered by India's rising diplomatic and economic clout – the country overtook Britain as the world's fifth-biggest economy in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an Indian, I feel that he has ensured a lot of respect and prestige for India during his term," Shikha Aggarwal, 40, said while waiting to cast her vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People now look at India and Indians with a lot more respect, something not accorded earlier."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India has voted in seven phases over six weeks to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turnout is down several percentage points from the last national election in 2019, with analysts blaming widespread expectations of a Modi victory as well as successive heatwaves scorching India's northern states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in the eastern state of Bihar said on Friday that 10 poll workers had died of heatstroke the previous day while setting up for the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extensive scientific research shows climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense, with Asia warming faster than the global average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A scorching sun bore down on Varanasi and its countless temples and riverside crematoriums during Saturday's vote, with afternoon temperatures peaking at 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last few days have been very tough," housewife Bindwasvini Devi, who voted soon after polls opened to beat the scorching temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've tried to stay hydrated and avoided going out as much as possible." (AFP)

 Indonesia's president-elect, Prabowo Subianto, said on Saturday that his country was willing to send peacekeeping troops to enforce a ceasefire in Gaza if required.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security conference, Prabowo said US President Joe Biden's three-phase proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza was a step in the right direction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When needed and when requested by the UN, we are prepared to contribute significant peacekeeping forces to maintain and monitor this prospective ceasefire as well as providing protection and security to all parties and to all sides," Prabowo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 72-year-old former special forces general and current Indonesian defence minister takes on the presidency of the world's most populous Muslim nation in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said President Joko Widodo had instructed him to announce that Indonesia was also ready "to evacuate, to receive and to treat with medical care up to 1,000 patients" from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Indonesia Hospital in Gaza, which was run by an Indonesia NGO, closed in November amid the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo said a comprehensive investigation into the humanitarian disaster in the Rafah area of Gaza was needed as well as a "just solution" to the situation in Palestine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And that means the rights of not only Israel to exist, but also the rights of the Palestinian people to have their own homeland, their own state, living in peace." (Reuters)

 Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa cancelled his "dearMoon" mission, which the project said was to have been the first private flight around the moon, the mission announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The team had originally aimed to make the circumlunar flight, with celebrities on board, by the end of last year but that became "unfeasible", the mission said in a statement on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without clear schedule certainty in the near-term, it is with a heavy heart that Maezawa made the unavoidable decision to cancel the project," it said. "To all who have supported this project and looked forward to this endeavor, we sincerely appreciate it and apologize for this outcome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement did not give further details on the cause of the cancellation. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean defence minister Shin Won-sik said on Saturday that more evidence suggests weapons used by Russia in the war in Ukraine were illegally imported from North Korea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Military cooperation between Russia and North Korea" is escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and "also affecting the battlefield in Europe", Shin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If North Korea continues to receive military technology transfers from Russia in return, a significant improvement in North Korea's conventional military capability is an imminent risk, Shin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On questions about whether South Korea may seek nuclear weapons of its own, Shin said that South Korea trusts the global nonproliferation treaty (NPT) regime, and that a stronger US-South Korean alliance is the answer to North Korea's nuclear development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shin was speaking during the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's biggest defence forum, under way in Singapore. The event ends on June 2. (Reuters)

    Questioning Trump guilty verdict 'dangerous': Biden

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday that it was "dangerous" for people to question the integrity of the guilty verdict in Donald Trump's hush money jury trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his first public comments since a New York jury on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts over a payment to silence an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election, Biden, a Democrat, struck out hard at Trump and other Republicans who have criticised the verdict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself." Biden said. He noted that the case against Trump in New York was brought by the state, that it was not a federal case, and that the verdict was delivered by "a jury of 12 citizens, 12 Americans, 12 people like you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US justice system has endured for nearly 250 years, Biden said, and he criticised Trump and his supporters for attempting to tear it down with false allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's reckless, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In rambling remarks earlier on Friday at the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan, Trump repeated his complaints that the trial was an attempt to hobble his comeback White House bid and said it showed that no American was safe from politically motivated prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone," Trump said in an unscripted 33-minute speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's guilty verdict catapults the United States into unexplored territory ahead of the November 5 vote, when Trump, 77, will try to win back the White House from Biden, 81. (Reuters)

    Biden says Israel offers new roadmap to end Gaza war

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The US president has urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755636_1_20240601031825.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Israel was offering a new roadmap towards a full ceasefire in Gaza that he urged Hamas to accept, saying it's "time for this war to end."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's intervention, which had been heavily trailed, came as Israeli troops pushed into central Rafah, escalating its nearly eight-month war with Hamas despite international objections to any assault on the south Gaza city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came as top diplomat Antony Blinken acknowledged that despite US efforts to get more aid into Gaza, the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory remained "dire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first major address outlining how the Gaza war might end, Biden said that Israel's three-stage offer would begin with a six-week phase that would see Israeli forces withdraw from all populated areas of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also see the "release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, in exchange for (the) release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and the Palestinians would then negotiate during those six weeks for a lasting ceasefire – but the truce would continue while the talks remained underway, Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US president urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's time for this war to end, for the day after to begin," he said, adding: "We can't lose this moment" to seize the chance for peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After successive rounds of indirect negotiations in recent months all failed, Hamas said earlier on Friday that it had informed mediators it would only agree a "comprehensive" truce including a hostage-prisoner swap if Israel halts its "aggression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's Qatar-based political office, accused Israel of "using negotiations as a cover to continue its aggression," saying Hamas "refuses to be a part of these manoeuvres."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas since the Palestinian militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel sent tanks and troops into Rafah in early May, ignoring concerns over the safety of displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering in the city on the Egyptian border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, soldiers were operating in the city centre where they uncovered rocket launchers and tunnel shafts and dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility, the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A stream of civilians has flooded out of Rafah, taking their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering in the city. Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged on Friday that the humanitarian situation was "dire" despite US efforts to bring in more assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Food Programme said daily life had become "apocalyptic" in parts of southern Gaza since Israel began its assault on Rafah in early May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency was able to provide "ever decreasing amounts of assistance," with all of its bakeries in Rafah closed due to a lack of fuel and supplies, its director for the Palestinian territories, Matthew Hollingworth, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan announced it will host a summit on June 11, jointly organised with Egypt and the United Nations, bringing together aid agency chiefs and heads of donor governments to discuss the humanitarian response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas released a video on Telegram on Friday featuring the audio of a woman's voice, who they said was one of the hostages. The audio file could not immediately be verified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,284 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    S Africa set for coalition talks as ANC loses majority

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Representatives of the ANC follow live voting results at the Independent Electoral Commission. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755632_1_20240601022857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on track on Friday to score its worst electoral result ever, with the latest tallies showing voters deserted the party in droves and ended its 30-year political dominance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The African National Congress (ANC) is now all but certain to fall below 50 percent of the vote, forcing the party to seek a coalition partner to have enough backing to name a president and form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks an historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, as the party has enjoyed an absolute parliamentary majority since 1994, when its then leader Nelson Mandela led the nation out of white minority rule and into democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With more than two thirds of the votes cast in Wednesday's general election counted, the ANC remained in the lead but with a score below 42 percent, compared to the 57 percent it won in 2019 and far off the 62 percent secured by Mandela in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As votes continued to be validated, data from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) showed the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) held second place with 22.64 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was not a surge by the DA that cut into the ANC's vote share.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In third place was former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) on 12 percent, a surprise score for a party founded barely six months ago as a vehicle for the former ANC chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected at the weekend, but with the trends clear and the votes stacking up on the IEC website, politicians and pundits were turning their attention to the prospects of an ANC-led coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party, but if the latest, President Cyril Ramaphosa, is to remain at the helm he will have to decide whether to seek allies on his right or his left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be resistance within his movement to a tie-up with the second-placed DA, under white politician John Steenhuisen, whose pro-free market programme of privatisation and an end to black economic empowerment programmes is at odds with the ruling party's traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there will also be reluctance to invite Zuma, who left government facing a raft of corruption allegations, or firebrand Julius Malema's radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) into government after both fought bitter campaigns against their former party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC retains the loyalty of many voters for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts expect the party to patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups, especially as the Zuma's MK has stormed to victory in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The MK has really eaten into the ANC's vote," said Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, like analyst and author Susan Booysen, said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma – who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018 – was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might instead prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But another outside observer, political analyst and business leader Sandile Swana, argued that Ramaphosa's authority had take such a beating in the election that he would not be able to push reluctant party bigwigs to accept a DA alliance. "His power is gone within the ANC," he said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged on Friday that the humanitarian situation was "dire" in Gaza as Israel pushes in deeper, despite US efforts to bring in more assistance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken spoke a day after USAID chief Samantha Power quoted aid workers as saying that the "conditions are worse now than ever before" in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The humanitarian situation remains dire for people in Gaza," Blinken told reporters in Prague when asked about Power's remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've seen changes – some positive changes – but the net effect is not there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken added that while the number of aid trucks entering Gaza was up "significantly," distribution remained difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed to the impact of Israeli military operations around the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah and the closure of the Rafah border into Egypt after Israel seized control of the crossing from the Hamas militant group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're not just measuring inputs, we're measuring impact. And yes, the impact remains insufficient in terms of addressing the acute needs of children, women and men in Gaza," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has pursued military operations in Rafah despite a warning from President Joe Biden, though the White House says the assault is smaller than the type of massive operation which he had called unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has built a temporary pier into Gaza at a cost of at least US$320 million, but it was damaged in poor weather, suspending deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,2844 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday said it would be "difficult" for it to take part in a planned conference on the war in Ukraine in June if Russia did not attend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine is trying to whip up attendance at the peace conference in Switzerland, where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged China to take part but Beijing insisted any summit would need the participation of Russia, which Ukraine has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing believes the conference "should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans", foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A political scholar on Friday said it was unlikely the Republican Party would abandon Donald Trump as its presumptive presidential nominee.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The former president was convicted in an historic criminal case of falsifying business records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Wong, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and fellow at the Centre on Contemporary China and the World at the University of Hong Kong, said Trump retains strong support from his party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said that Trump's conviction may affect independent voters in swing states, but he didn't think it would benefit his challenger, President Joe Biden, a great deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no reason to think that Trump is therefore ineligible. And that's because the US Constitution has only three requirements when it comes to eligibility for candidacy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One, the candidate must be at least 35 years old. Secondly, they must be a natural born US citizen. And thirdly, they must have lived in the US for at least 14 years. There's no stipulation that they must not have a criminal record. So this will not affect his nominal and technical eligibility to run as a candidate should the Republican National Convention decide that is indeed to be the case."

    Two giant pandas are the new stars at Madrid zoo

<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitors to Spain's Madrid Zoo Aquarium were on Thursday introduced to a giant panda couple from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Male Jin Xi and female Zhu Yu, both born in 2020, arrived last month at the zoo following the renewal of its agreement for giant panda protection with the China Wildlife Conservation Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed a smooth quarantine period before making their debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sofia, the former queen of Spain, hosted the official introduction of the three-year-old bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are proud to host this unique species and to contribute to its preservation," Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Ambassador to Spain, Yao Jing, highlighted that "the friendly bond" created by the pandas would unite the two peoples and serve as "an important symbol of China-Spain friendship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the debut of the giant panda couple, visitors to the zoo can now participate in educational activities every weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We try to bring information about pandas to the public so they can know pandas better and how we can protect the species," zoo staff Luis Manchado, who is responsible for the educational section, told Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two pandas are set to remain in Spain for the next 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has loaned its treasured bears to overseas zoos over the years as goodwill ambassadors, while also running conservation programmes back home that have seen their status improve from endangered to vulnerable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are 728 pandas in zoos and breeding centres around the world.

    Trump convicted on all charges in hush money trial

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Should Donald Trump win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755463_1_20240531051916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New York jury convicted Donald Trump on all charges in his hush money case on Thursday in a seismic development barely five months ahead of the election where he seeks to recapture the White House.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic first criminal trial of a former US president ended with the 77-year-old Trump found guilty on each of the 34 charges of falsifying business records to hide a payment meant to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, who is all but certain to appeal, did not immediately react, but sat still, his shoulders dipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conviction thrusts the United States into uncharted political territory but does not bar Trump from a White House run, even in the unlikely event that Judge Juan Merchan sentences him to prison time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict comes just weeks before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is due to receive the party's formal nomination to face Democratic President Joe Biden on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12-member jury deliberated for more than 11 hours over two days at the end of the extraordinary five-week trial held in a drab Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a US$130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election, when her claim to have had sex with him could have proved politically fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial featured lengthy testimony from the adult performer, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and who described to the court in graphic detail what she says was a 2006 sexual encounter with the married Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors successfully laid out a case alleging that the hush money and the illegal covering up of the payment was part of a broader crime to prevent voters from knowing about Trump's behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's defence attorneys had countered that "trying to influence an election" was simply "democracy" and that the former president did nothing wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial has distracted Trump from his campaign to unseat Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he milked the media attention throughout, with daily speeches in front of the cameras outside the courtroom in which he complained about being a political victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identities of the 12 jurors deciding the case were kept secret, a rare practice more often see in cases involving mafia or other violent defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After teasing the prospect for weeks, Trump – who denied ever having sex with Daniels at a 2006 celebrity golf tournament – opted not to testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican, who made his name as a brash real estate mogul before a stunning ascent to the nation's highest office in the 2016 election, now faces prison or, more likely, probation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In theory, he could face up to four years in jail for each count of falsifying business records but legal experts said as a first-time offender he is unlikely to go behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An appeal could take months to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Should he win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself, given that the case was not brought by the federal government but by the state of New York, where only the governor could clear his name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also faces federal and state charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden, and for hoarding secret documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

    ANC on track to lose majority after South Africa vote

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Cyril Ramaphosa was all smiles after casting his ballot at a polling station in Soweto. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755457_1_20240531031603.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on course to lose its 30-year-old parliamentary majority on Thursday, opening the prospect that the party that defeated apartheid will have to share power for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With a third of votes in Wednesday's election tallied, the ANC was leading but with a score of only 42 percent – well below the 57 percent it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Followed by the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) on 25 percent. The leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and former South African president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) were neck and neck on around nine percent each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected in the next three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The broad church of the ANC has taken a substantial knock. This is a shock to the system for the ANC and ultimately will also be a shock to the system for the average South African, who has only known ANC rule since 1994," said political analyst Daniel Silke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It redraws the political boundaries of South Africa and creates a degree of uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If President Cyril Ramaphosa's party is confirmed as dropping below 50 percent, it would force him to seek coalition partners to be re-elected to form a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would be a historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, which was underlined by newspaper headlines on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SA on the cusp of shift in politics," read the front page of daily BusinessDay. "The people have spoken," headlined The Citizen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party remains respected for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule, and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people in power are hopefully going to come down and we will have a new political party," Shaun Manyoni, a 21-year-old student, said in Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa's opponents from both the left and the right came to the polls on Wednesday hoping either to replace the ANC with an opposition alliance or force the party to negotiate a coalition agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Zuma ran this country perfectly ... so let's put him back and let South Africa run again," said Don Naidoo, a middle-aged small business owner from the province's largest city of Durban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voting was marked by hours-long queues in many districts, which in some cases forced polls to remain open well beyond closing time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) said a last-minute rush in urban voting and high turnout were to blame for the late finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost all votes had been counted by 3:00 pm on Thursday, but most had yet to be validated, IEC's head Sy Mamabolo told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While, the process was "proceeding well," officials said they expected it would take longer than the usual 24 hours to reach an 80 percent tally, due to delays caused by the new three-ballot system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the ANC gets close to 50 percent it could shore up a majority by allying itself with some of the four dozen smaller and regional parties contesting the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this appeared increasingly unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts were split on who the ANC would prefer as bedfellows and on whether the poor performance threatened Ramaphosa's leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His power is gone within the ANC," said analyst Sandile Swana, predicting that the party would patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups led by former ANC figures: firebrand Julius Malema's EFF or Zuma's MK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a major upset, the latter was leading with 43 percent of preferences in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, a key electoral battleground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg said MK was a natural partner for the ANC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have similar policies and similar tendencies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analyst and author Susan Booysen said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma, who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018, was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added. (AFP)

    Spain parliament passes controversial amnesty bill

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The biggest beneficiary of the amnesty bill will be Carles Puigdemont – the former Catalan leader who fled Spain to avoid prosecution. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755447_1_20240530234022.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's parliament gave the final green light to a controversial amnesty bill for Catalan separatists on Thursday, paving the way for the return of their figurehead Carles Puigdemont after years of self-imposed exile.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislation seeks to draw a line under years of efforts to prosecute those involved in the botched 2017 Catalan independence bid that triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The text, which has been resolutely opposed by Spain's right and far-right opposition, passed by 177 votes in favour to 172 votes against in the 350-seat parliament. One person was absent from the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing the amnesty is a key moment for Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, as it was a demand made by separatist parties in exchange for their parliamentary support to allow him to serve a new term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, Spain's lower house of parliament passed the bill, which grants an amnesty to hundreds of separatists involved in Catalonia's failed 2017 independence bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It then went to the Senate upper house, which is dominated by the right-wing opposition, where it was symbolically vetoed – as the Senate cannot block a bill, but only propose amendments – before returning to the lower house on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a rowdy two-and-a-half hour debate during which the Speaker was forced to call order several times due to the insults traded on the floor, the bill passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will now be up to individual judges to decide whether the amnesty applies to their cases. They have two months to raise issues with the Constitutional Court or the European justice system which could delay the law's implementation for some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest beneficiary will be Puigdemont – the former Catalan leader who led the bid then fled Spain to avoid prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His hardline separatist JxCat and its moderate rival ERC both demanded the amnesty in return for their votes in November that let Sanchez secure another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What opened that door was Spain's inconclusive July 2023 election, which was won by the right-wing Popular Party (PP) but without enough parliamentary support to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With JxCat cast as kingmaker, Sanchez won them over with the promise of an amnesty and returned to office, in a move sparking fierce and unrelenting opposition from the PP and the far-right Vox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have drawn thousands onto the streets in mass protests against the bill that at times turned violent, notably around the Socialists' Madrid headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, a PP spokesman said that even after it passes, the party would do everything to "overturn" the law, whether through appeals to the Constitutional Court or "social pressure" on the street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surveys suggest Spaniards are divided over the amnesty, even Sanchez's own Socialists and their supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the outcome of Catalonia's regional election on May 12, in which the Socialists won a clear victory, has shifted the picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The separatists lost their absolute majority in the Catalan parliament after 10 years in power, suggesting the focus has shifted away from independence, vindicating Sanchez's strategy of seeking to defuse tensions around the 2017 crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader of the Socialist Party's Catalan branch, Salvador Illa, is hoping to lead the region's new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results show that Catalonia has chosen "the path of forgiveness, giving up any kind of resentment," Sanchez said in Barcelona last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Puigdemont, whose party increased support during the vote and has said he wants to lead a minority separatist administration, is hoping to be home back in time to see a new Catalan government take office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the date has not yet been set, it is expected to take place by June 25 at the latest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is unclear whether that will be possible, given the two month time span for the courts to enact the legislation, which involves releasing those behind bars and cancelling outstanding arrest warrants, including the one for Puigdemont. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and his wife Roh So-young. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755442_1_20240530224208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of South Korea's sprawling SK Group was ordered by a court on Thursday to pay his wife US$1 billion in cash in the country's largest divorce settlement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Seoul High Court ordered Chey Tae-won to pay Roh So-young, the daughter of former president Roh Tae-woo, 1.38 trillion won as a settlement, court documents showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount was a significant increase from an earlier lower court ruling of 66.5 billion won and takes into account the contributions Roh So-young and her father made to Chey's success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SK Group runs businesses that include South Korea's leading mobile carrier and also controls SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory chip maker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was reasonable to rule that, as his wife, Roh played a role in increasing the value of SK Group and Chey's business activity," the court said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey married Roh So-young in 1988 but they have been separated for years. She appealed against the original settlement amount awarded in 2022, several years after Chey filed for divorce in what has become an acrimonious case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the new settlement also took into account the emotional suffering Roh So-young endured due to Chey's extramarital affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey has a child with his new partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said Chey "is not showing any signs of remorse for his foul behaviour in the course of the trial... nor respect for monogamy," ordering him to pay the settlement in cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey's net wealth was assessed by the court to be around four trillion won, meaning Roh So-young will take 35 percent of it in the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His legal team said they would lodge an appeal against the latest ruling, claiming the court had "taken Roh's one-sided claim as factual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Seoul High Court said Roh Tae-woo also helped Chey's business flourish during his five years as president from 1988, easing regulatory hurdles for SK's late former chairman Chey Jong-hyon, Chey Tae-won's father.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Former president Roh Tae-woo played the role of a protective shield for ex-chairman Chey Jong-hyon" when the late businessman was trying to tap into the mobile carrier business, the court said, giving "intangible help" to the family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey's lawyers disagreed, saying SK Group had been under pressure from the Roh government and had "provided various financial contributions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will set things straight through the appeal," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former general, Roh Tae-woo was elected to the presidency in 1987 polls that were South Korea's first free and fair election in more than a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had earlier helped his military academy friend Chun Doo-hwan stage a military coup and take over as a dictator. (AFP)

 Iran opened a five-day registration period on Thursday for hopefuls wanting to run in the June 28 presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier this month with seven others.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The election comes as Iran grapples with the aftermath of the May 19 crash, as well as heightened tensions with Israel and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The period would see those between the ages of 40 to 75 with at least a master's degree register as potential candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All candidates ultimately must be approved by Iran's 12-member Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists ultimately overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That panel has never accepted a woman nor anyone calling for radical change within the country's governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is unlear who will run. The country’s acting president, Mohammad Mokhber, a previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, could be a front-runner, because he's already been seen meeting with Khamenei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also discussed as possible aspirants are former hard-line President Mohammad Ahmadinejad and former reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-day registration period will close on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guardian Council is expected to issue its final list of candidates within 10 days afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will allow for a shortened two-week campaign before the vote in late June. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military officials on Thursday said North Korea fired a barrage of suspected ballistic missiles toward its eastern sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The missile launch comes days after its attempt to put a military reconnaissance satellite into orbit ended in failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the North firing around 10 projectiles that appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles from an area near its capital, Pyongyang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the suspected missiles flew around 350 kilometres before landing in waters off the North’s eastern coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the South Korean military had increased surveillance and shared its information with the United States and Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan’s coast guard issued a maritime safety advisory over the North Korean launches
  <br/>
  and urged ships to exercise caution if they find any fallen objects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters the suspected missiles were believed to have landed in waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone and there were no immediate reports of damages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Tokyo “strongly condemns” the launches, which are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday announced that China would host the second China-Arab States Summit in 2026, adding it would be another milestone in Beijing's relations with the Middle East region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the announcement as he delivered a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi also called for a peace conference on the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas as he addressed Arab leaders and diplomats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is this week hosting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and several other Arab leaders for a forum at which discussions on the war in Gaza were expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the delegations, Xi said China supported a "broad-based" peace conference to resolve the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Middle East is a land bestowed with broad prospects for development, but the war is still raging on it," Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "War should not continue indefinitely. Justice should not be absent forever," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also said China supports Palestine's full membership of the United Nations.(Xinhua/AFP)

    Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula hit by fresh eruption

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula hit by fresh eruption" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755282_1_20240530024723.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new volcano erupted on the Reykjanes peninsula in southwestern Iceland on Wednesday, spewing red-hot lava into the air shortly after authorities evacuated the nearby town of Grindavik.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A large white cloud of smoke could be seen, with orange lava fountains bubbling out of a crack in the ground near Sundhnukagigar, north of Grindavik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption was the fifth in six months on the Reykjanes peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two hours after the start of the eruption, lava was flowing less than a kilometre from a defensive barrier protecting the fishing village of Grindavik, the barrier itself located about another kilometre from the northern tip of the town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the 4,000 residents had evacuated Grindavik in November, prior to a December eruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lava flowed into the town's streets during another eruption in January, engulfing three homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the large share of those who were in the town on Wednesday -- for work or visits -- left immediately, a few die-hard residents refused to leave, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite recommendations from response teams to leave the town, three residents remain in Grindavik. Such actions are not advisable," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nearby Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, Iceland's biggest tourist attraction known for its turquoise waters, said it had evacuated its facilities on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maia Biegatch, a 28-year-old French tourist, had just arrived at the Blue Lagoon when the eruption occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We received alerts on our phones telling us to 'evacuate, evacuate', so we turned back," she told AFP. "It was a total surprise."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption was, however, not expected to disrupt air traffic, with the international airport Keflavik "open and operating in the usual way", airport operator Isavia said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The eruption cloud reached an altitude of about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) at the beginning of the eruption" and the length of the fissure was estimated at over one kilometre, the Iceland Meteorological Office said shortly after the eruption began at 12:46 pm (1246 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 90 minutes later, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management said the fissure had extended to 3.4 kilometres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lava flow was heavy, estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000 cubic metres per second, the IMO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eruption came almost three weeks after the end of a previous eruption that had been ongoing since March 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the past six months, volcanoes have erupted on the peninsula in December, January, February and March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMO had reported "intense earthquake activity" prior to Wednesday's eruption, with "about 400 earthquakes" measured in the past seven days near the Sundhnukagigar crater row. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said the panel will foster a European AI ecosystem that's "innovative, competitive and respectful of EU rules and values". File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755276_1_20240530005254.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Wednesday announced the creation of an "AI Office" of tech experts, lawyers and economists to regulate artificial intelligence under a sweeping new law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The EU this year approved the world's first comprehensive rules to govern AI, especially powerful systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT after long, intense negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First proposed in 2021, the bloc raced to get the law in the books after ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, leaving users stunned by its ability to churn out coherent text including poems within seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The AI Office aims at enabling the future development, deployment and use of AI in a way that fosters societal and economic benefits and innovation, while mitigating risks," the European Commission said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 140-member AI Office will be established within the commission, which is the EU's executive arm and also acts as the bloc's powerful tech regulator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Office will foster a European AI ecosystem that is innovative, competitive and respectful of EU rules and values," the EU's top tech enforcer, Thierry Breton, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's law known as the "AI Act" has tougher rules for general-purpose AI systems such as ChatGPT and takes a risk-based approach to the technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The higher the risk to Europeans' rights or health, for example, the greater the systems' obligations to protect individuals from harms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with developers and a scientific community, the office will evaluate and test general purpose AI to ensure that AI serves us as humans and upholds our European values," commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Companies will have to comply with the EU's law by 2026, but rules covering AI models like ChatGPT will apply 12 months after the law becomes official.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's announcement came on the same day that EU auditors criticised the commission for failing to sufficiently invest in AI to achieve the bloc's ambitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, stronger governance and more -- and better targeted -- public and private investment in the EU will be paramount if the EU is to achieve its AI ambitions," the bloc's spending watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the commission defended the bloc's record and said it was investing more than one billion euros (US$1.1 billion) annually in AI research projects under different schemes. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The Geneva-based International Labour Organization expects unemployment to stay at 4.9 percent in 2025, but warned that "inequalities in labour markets persist". File photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755273_1_20240530002708.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global unemployment is set to fall slightly this year, a United Nations agency said on Wednesday, reversing its previous prediction of a rise while warning of "slow progress" on tackling inequalities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Labour Organization (ILO) expects a global unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in 2024, after originally forecasting unemployment would rise to 5.2 percent this year from 5 percent in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a report, the Geneva-based UN agency forecasts that the rate will stay at 4.9 percent in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the ILO cautioned that "inequalities in labour markets persist, with women in low-income countries particularly affected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report found that 183 million people meet the definition of unemployed, meaning they are actively looking for work and are immediately available. But the number of people without a job who wanted to work stood at 402 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency also said women were more likely to be unwillingly out of work and disproportionately affected by a lack of opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Women in low-income countries were especially hard-hit, with 22.8 percent who wanted a job not in work, compared with 15.3 percent for men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For high-income countries, the rate stood at 9.7 percent for women and 7.3 percent for men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report also warned that these differences were just the "tip of the iceberg" as women were much more likely than men to have left the labour force altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worldwide, the report estimated that 45.6 percent of women of working age were employed in 2024. For men, the figure was 69.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite our efforts to reduce global inequalities, the labour market remains an uneven playing field," ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo is quoted as saying in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To achieve a sustainable recovery whose benefits are shared by all... we must place inclusion and social justice at the core of our policies and institutions," Houngbo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ILO is the oldest specialised UN agency and brings together employers, unions and governments from around the world. (AFP)

    South African general election gets underway

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africans began voting on Wednesday in the most competitive election since the end of apartheid, with opinion polls suggesting the African National Congress (ANC) would lose its parliamentary majority after 30 years in government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Then led by Nelson Mandela, the ANC swept to power in South Africa's first multi-racial election in 1994 and won a majority in national elections held every five years since then, though its share of the vote has gradually declined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Wednesday's election, voters choose the 400 members of the National Assembly and these MPs will then go on in the coming weeks to choose a president from among their number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Candidates for South Africa's nine provincial assemblies were also on the ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If it falls short of a 50 percent majority, the ANC could be forced to negotiate a coalition deal with one or more of the smaller parties in order to continue governing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect the ANC to do well enough to remain the largest party in parliament,
  <br/>
  meaning its leader, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, was likely to stay in office, unless he faced an internal challenge if the party's performance was worse than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voter dissatisfaction over high rates of unemployment and crime, frequent power blackouts and corruption in party ranks lies behind the ANC's gradual fall from grace. (Reuters)

    Record temperatures scorch India's capital

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures in India's capital soared to a record-high 49.9 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, the government's weather bureau said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The India Meteorological Department, which reported "severe heat-wave conditions", recorded the temperatures at two New Delhi suburb stations at Narela and Mungeshpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters predict similar temperatures on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May 2022, parts of New Delhi hit 49.2 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India is no stranger to searing summer temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But scientists have found climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi authorities also warned of the risk of water shortages as the capital swelters in an intense heatwave -- cutting supplies to some areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Water Minister Atishi Marlena called for "collective responsibility" to stop wasteful water use, the Times of India newspaper reported Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's attorney general's office on Wednesday said former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra would be prosecuted for insulting the monarchy over comments he made almost a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prayuth Pecharakun, spokesman for the attorney general, said Thaksin would be summoned to court on June 18 to answer charges under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, 74, is a two-time premier who was ousted in a 2006 coup and then lived in self exile for 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned to Thailand last year as his Pheu Thai party took power at the head of a coalition government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attorney general has decided to indict Thaksin for insulting the monarchy," Prayuth told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attorney general cannot bring him to court today, as his (Thaksin's) lawyer said he has Covid."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand has some of the world's strictest royal defamation laws protecting King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each charge bringing a potential 15-year prison sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin's lawyer, Winyat Chatmontree, said he would fight the charges. (AFP)

    Trump lawyers wrap up defence in hush money case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Trump lawyers wrap up defence in hush money case" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755118_1_20240529053655.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defence lawyers in Donald Trump's hush money trial made their final pitch to the jury on Tuesday, insisting the first ever criminal prosecution of a former US president was based on "lies."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Less than six months before American voters choose whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes riding on the verdict are hard to overstate -- for the 77-year-old personally, but also for the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a US$130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, when her account of a 2006 sexual encounter could have doomed his 2016 presidential campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very dangerous day for America," Trump told reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom as three of his five children -- Don Jr, Eric and Tiffany -- stood behind him. "We have a rigged court case that should have never been brought."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Trump is innocent," his defense attorney Todd Blanche told the jury at the start of what he said would be about two-and-a-half hours of closing arguments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The consequences of the lack of proof you have heard over the last five weeks is simple -- it's a not guilty verdict," Blanche said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attacked Cohen, the prosecution's star witness, as a liar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He told you a number of things on that witness stand that were lies, pure and simple," Blanche said. "You cannot convict president Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the word of Michael Cohen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then-president Trump was "busy running the country" when the reimbursements were made to Cohen," he said, and he did not inspect all the invoices that came across his desk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was no intent to defraud and beyond that there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by president Trump," Blanche said. "He did not commit any crimes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump had a grim expression as his lawyer spoke, his head tilted as he studied the jurors. He gave a thumbs-up as he left the courtroom during a break but did not address reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors will get the last word. They will lay out the case that Trump falsified records to keep the hush money payment secret amid fear that the episode could sink his already rocky outsider's bid to defeat Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12 jurors -- whose identities have been kept secret for their protection -- will start deliberations as early as Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden in the White House race and the verdict will inject new tension into an already bitter contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on behalf of the Biden campaign outside court, actor Robert De Niro berated Trump as a "clown" and "grubby real estate developer" intent on destroying the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is the first former or sitting president under criminal indictment, with charges ranging from the relatively minor hush money case to accusations that he took top secret documents and tried to overthrow the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York case, which featured more than 20 witnesses over five weeks, is the only one likely to have come to trial by election day on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump would almost certainly appeal and a conviction would not bar him from appearing on the ballot in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump chose not to testify in his defence -- a move that would have exposed him to damaging cross-examination. (AFP)

    Putin warns west of 'serious consequences'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the west not to let Ukraine use their munitions against targets within Russia. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755115_1_20240529005630.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that there would be "serious consequences" if Western countries allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to strike targets in Russia, as sought by Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin's warning came in response to calls within some Nato members as well as the alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg to allow Ukraine to use their arms to step up attacks on Russian soil, in an attempt to end more than two years of fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences," Putin said during a visit to Uzbekistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Europe, especially in small countries, they should be aware of what they are playing with," he said, noting that many European countries had "small territory" and a "dense population".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And this factor, which they should keep in mind before they talk about striking deep into Russian territory, is a serious thing," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that even if Ukraine's forces carried out the strikes, responsibility for them would lie with Western suppliers of the weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They want a global conflict," he said. Western countries have long been wary of being deemed a belligerent in the Ukraine conflict as they provide support to Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also said that while he believed Western military instructors were already in Ukraine operating undercover as mercenaries, any move by countries to send them officially would be another "escalation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's top commander announced Monday that talks were being held with France on sending military instructors to the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is another step towards a serious conflict in Europe, towards a global conflict," Putin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are specialists there under the guise of mercenaries," he said, adding that "this was nothing new".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they would be "defeated" by the Russian army, as "we will do what we think is necessary regardless of who is on the territory of Ukraine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Brussels that European countries were split on sending military instructors to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Countries including Germany oppose taking a step they fear could potentially drag them closer to direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU countries have trained 50,000 Ukrainian troops outside the war-torn country under a bloc-wide mission set up in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing Western allies to provide longer-range missiles and other material for striking deeper into Russia in a bid to cripple its military and industrial capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the war now in its third year, Ukraine is also pleading for more weapons for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, notably seeking help to address its lack of air defence systems. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis issued an extraordinary apology on Tuesday over his reported use of a gay slur in a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms and he extends his apologies to those who felt offended by the use of a term, reported by others," the Vatican said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a meeting with more than 250 bishops last week, the 87-year-old pontiff was said to have used an offensive term while expressing his opposition to openly homosexual men joining training colleges for priests, even if they committed to celibacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to two Italian newspapers, Francis said there was already too much "frociaggine" in seminaries, using an offensive Roman term which translates as "faggotry".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reports made headlines around the world and drew dismay from both LGTBQ groups and practising Catholics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some commentators suggested the Argentine pope did not know what he was saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Vatican statement did not confirm that he used the word but referenced newspaper articles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As he had the opportunity to state on several occasions: 'In the Church there is room for everyone, everyone! Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just as we are, all of us'," the statement said. (AFP)

    Report warns of growing number of extreme heat days

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Heat is the leading cause of climate-related death and global warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755111_1_20240528234629.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world experienced an average of 26 more days of extreme heat over the last 12 months that would probably not have occurred without climate change, a report said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Heat is the leading cause of climate-related death and the report further points to the role of global warming in increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For this study, scientists used the years 1991 to 2020 to determine what temperatures counted as within the top 10 percent for each country over that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next, they looked at the 12 months to May 15, 2024, to establish how many days over that period experienced temperatures within -- or beyond -- the previous range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, using peer-reviewed methods, they examined the influence of climate change on each of these excessively hot days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They concluded that "human-caused climate change added -- on average, across all places in the world -- 26 more days of extreme heat than there would have been without it".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report was published by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, the World Weather Attribution scientific network and the non-profit research organisation Climate Central.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2023 was the hottest year on record, according to the European Union's climate monitor, Copernicus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already this year, extreme heatwaves have afflicted swathes of the globe from Mexico to Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report said that in the last 12 months some 6.3 billion people -- roughly 80 percent of the global population -- experienced at least 31 days of what is classed as extreme heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, 76 extreme heatwaves were registered in 90 different countries on every continent except Antarctica.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five of the most affected nations were in Latin America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report said that without the influence of climate change, Suriname would have recorded an estimated 24 extreme heat days instead of 182; Ecuador 10 not 180; Guyana 33 not 174, El Salvador 15 not 163; and Panama 12 not 149.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(Extreme heat) is known to have killed tens of thousands of people over the last 12 months but the real number is likely in the hundreds of thousands or even millions," the Red Cross said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Flooding and hurricanes may capture the headlines but the impacts of extreme heat are equally deadly," said Jagan Chapagain, secretary general of the International Federation of the Red Cross. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed "grave concern" over Israel's military operations in Rafah, where an Israeli strike killed dozens in a displaced persons camp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning also said China urged "all parties to protect civilians and civilian facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing also said it "strongly urges Israel to listen to the appeals of the international community and to stop its attacks on Rafah".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been calling for an immediate ceasefire since the start of the current Israel-Hamas war in October last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, President Xi Jinping has called for an international peace conference to resolve the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting later on Tuesday over Israel's operations in the southern Gaza border city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement centre, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation. Israel said it was looking into the "tragic accident".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,200 civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry run by Hamas. (AFP)

    India, Bangladesh count the cost of killer cyclone

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Torrrential rain brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's remote northeastern state of Mizoram, killing at least 12 people, while harsh weather hampers efforts to rescue those trapped, authorities said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, killing at least 16 and cutting power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bitter weather was holding up rescue efforts in Melthum, the site of the quarry outside the state capital of Aizawl, a state disaster management official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse," the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no immediate details of the number trapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rain in Mizoram, which borders Bangladesh, also unleashed landslides in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity lines in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather experts in Bangladesh said the deadly cyclone was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting they'd experienced, blaming climate change for the shift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of its land duration, it is one of the longest in the country's history," Azizur Rahman, director of the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department told AFP, adding it had battered the country for more than 36 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, cyclone Aila, which hammered Bangladesh in 2009, lasted around 34 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slow-moving – and therefore longer-lasting – storms bring greater destruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've seen many storms in my life but nothing like this cyclone," said Asma Khatun, an 80-year-old widow who lives with her son, a fisherman in Bangladesh's hard-hit coastal town of Patuakhali.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before, the storm came and went away... now it doesn't seem to go away. The incessant pouring and heavy wind kept us stuck for days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahman said the cyclone triggered massive rains, with some cities receiving at least 200 millimetres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storm surges breached multiple embankments, meaning seawater flooded into farmland, damaged freshwater fish farms common along the coast, or corrupted drinking water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh's state minister for disaster Mohibbur Rahman said 3.75 million people had been affected by the cyclone, more than 35,000 homes were destroyed, and another 115,000 damaged. (Reuters/AFP)

 A member of Egypt's security forces was killed in a shooting incident near the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and an investigation is under way, Egypt's military spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's military had earlier said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A few hours ago (Monday), a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians," the Israeli military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Monday, Egypt warned against compromising the security and safety of its security forces, a high-level source told Egypt's state-linked Al Qahera News, adding that Egypt would take necessary measures to prevent the incident from recurring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Egyptian soldier stationed on a watchtower had reacted to seeing an armoured vehicle carrying Israeli troops cross a boundary line near the border while the soldiers pursued and killed several Palestinians, two Egyptian security sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier opened fire and Israeli forces fired back, killing him, the sources said, sparking an exchange of gunfire between the two sides. Several Israeli soldiers were wounded and the force fell back, and one Egyptian was wounded, the sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel seized control of the Rafah border crossing from the Gaza side of the border earlier this month as it stepped up its military offensive in the area, drawing strong criticism from Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt is concerned that Palestinians could be displaced from southern Gaza by the offensive, and has also repeatedly accused Israel of holding up deliveries of humanitarian aid to the territory, which Israel denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and have cooperated closely on security issues around the borders between Israel, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, and the Gaza Strip. They jointly upheld a blockade of Gaza after Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British lawmaker Lucy Allan, who had said she would not stand in the national election, was suspended from the governing Conservative Party on Monday after endorsing the candidate for the right-wing Reform UK party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This marks another setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has been on the campaign trail since calling a general election last week. Dozens of Conservative lawmakers have already said they won't be standing in the July 4 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Allan, 59, who was the Conservative member of parliament (MP) for the English town of Telford and has been an MP for nine years, said on social media that she was supporting Reform's Alan Adams to be the constituency's next MP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Conservative Party spokesperson said she had been suspended from the party with "immediate effect," adding that "a vote for Reform is a vote for (opposition Labour leader) Keir Starmer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A poll conducted by More in Common published a day after Sunak called the election on Wednesday showed 44 percent support for Labour and 27 percent for the Conservatives, with the right-wing Reform UK party at 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, former Conservative Party Deputy Chairman Lee Anderson, who was suspended from the party over accusations of Islamophobia, defected to Reform, which has Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage as its honorary president. (Reuters)

    Israel launches probe as leaders condemn Rafah strike

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong," he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on "precise intelligence", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French President Emmanuel Macron said he was "outraged" over Israel's latest attacks. "These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians," he said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling against action in Rafah must be respected. (Reuters)

    North Korean rocket explodes in satellite launch

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said its attempt to launch a new military reconnaissance satellite ended in failure on Monday when a newly developed rocket engine exploded in flight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The attempt came just hours after Pyongyang issued a warning that it would try to launch a satellite by June 4, in what would have been its second spy satellite in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead, the launch became the nuclear-armed North's latest failure, following two other fiery crashes last year. It successfully placed its first spy satellite in orbit in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage," the deputy director general of North Korea's National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a report carried by state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An intial analysis suggested that the cause was a newly developed liquid fuel rocket motor, but other possible causes were being investigated, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in South Korea and Japan had earlier reported that the launch seemed to have failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea fired the projectile on a southern path off its west coast at around 10.44pm, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JCS said it had detected a large amount of debris from the rocket in the sea just two minutes after launch, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The object launched by North Korea disappeared over the Yellow Sea, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding the government presumes nothing had entered the space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These launches are in violation of relevant security council resolutions and are a serious matter concerning the safety of our people," Hayashi said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to discuss speeding up talks for a trilateral free trade agreement, according to a joint statement released on Monday following their three-way summit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three countries also reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula at the ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit brought together Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three countries announced they would keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a trilateral free trade deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said they had agreed not to turn "economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the leaders had "decided to create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and investment, and to establish a safe supply chain".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After their talks, Li, Kishida and Yoon joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade among the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li called on relevant parties to exercise restraint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit, a move that violates United Nations sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would undermine regional and global peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said China, Japan and South Korea should properly handle sensitive issues and differences, and take care of each other's core interests and major concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the three leaders agreed to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and work together to tackle shared environmental, health and other issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trilateral cooperation system should be strengthened. We have decided to hold trilateral summits on a regular basis," Yoon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace, and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral meeting. (Xinhua & Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Papua New Guinea government on Monday said a landslide last Friday buried more than 2,000 people and that it had formally asked for international help.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government figure was around three times more than a United Nations’ estimate of 670.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Centre said the landslide “buried more than 2,000 people alive” and caused “major destruction”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A once-bustling remote hillside village in Enga province was almost wiped out when a chunk of Mount Mungalo collapsed in the early hours of Friday morning, burying scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said the number of possible deaths could change as rescue efforts were expected to continue for days. (Agencies)

 Premier Li Qiang on Monday called on relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent further complications of the situation on the Korean Peninsula as China, South Korea and Japan kicked off a trilateral summit between the three countries in Seoul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the premier said all parties should play a constructive role in pushing forward the political settlement process of the Korean Peninsula issue, and maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noting the current situation on the Korean Peninsula continued to be tense, Li said all parties should commit to easing the situation and restarting dialogue at an early date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media also reported that Li urged South Korea and Japan to reject "protectionism" and economic decoupling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, business leaders from China, South Korea and Japan agreed to step up their trilateral cooperation in a bid to revitalise trade and stabilise supply chains, they said in a joint statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint statement said the three-way partnership had become a "more pressing task" after experiencing slowing economies in each country. (Xinhua/AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Tunisia will visit China this week, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leaders will from May 28 to June 1 "pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation will be Bahrain's King Hamad, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China continues its role a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and President Xi Jinping has called for an "international peace conference" to resolve the fighting. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tornado-spawning storms swept across parts of the central United States, killing at least a dozen people and leaving a trail of destruction as forecasters warned of more severe weather over the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least seven people, including children, were killed in Texas when a powerful tornado struck communities in the north central part of the state near the Oklahoma border on Saturday night, Ray Sappington, the sheriff of Cooke County, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two children, aged two and five, were among the victims, Sappington said. Numerous injuries were reported, Cooke County officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the scale of the disaster came into full view on Sunday, officials were wrapping up search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sheriff said some of the many trailer homes in the hardest-hit area were "completely gone" and others had suffered massive damage from the storm which Sappington estimated left a quarter-mile wide path of destruction for three to four miles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tornado also crossed into Denton County, northwest of Dallas, on Saturday night, damaging homes and other property, and knocking down power lines. Officials said that "a number of individuals" with injuries were transported to area hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of customers were without power across a large swath of the country, including in Arkansas, Missouri and Texas on Sunday, according to poweroutages.us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in Arkansas also reported several storm-related fatalities, including one in Benton County, two in Marion County and a 73-year-old woman in Baxter county. Responding authorities described roads closed and clogged with debris, downed trees and power lines, homes and businesses destroyed, as well as numerous injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storms caused widespread damage and at least two fatalities in parts of Oklahoma, where officials activated an Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate efforts statewide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indiana, adverse weather delayed the start of the famed Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, or Indy 500, car race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest bout of extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through a rural Iowa town, killing four people. (Reuters)

 North Korea has notified Japan of its plan to launch a rocket carrying a space satellite towards the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and shared a view that North Korea's satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would be in violation of UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officials agreed to demand North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an emailed release. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People gather their belongings to head inland in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754785_1_20240526235020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An intense cyclone smashed into the low-lying coast of Bangladesh on Sunday, with nearly a million people fleeing inland for concrete storm shelters away from howling gales and crashing waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The severe Cyclone Remal has started crossing the Bangladesh coast," Bangladesh Meteorological Department Director Azizur Rahman said, adding the raging storm could continue hammering the coast until at least the early hours of Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have so far recorded maximum wind speeds of 90 kilometres per hour, but the wind speed may pick up more pace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters predicted gusts of up to 130 kilometres per hour, with heavy rain and winds also lashing neighbouring India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its densely populated coast has increased sharply, from one a year to as many as three, due to the impact of climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to four metres above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous," Bangladeshi senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level and high storm surges can devastate villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are terrified," said 35-year-old fisherman Yusuf Fakir at Kuakata, a town on the very southern tip of Bangladesh in the predicted route of the storm, speaking just before its arrival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 800,000 Bangladeshis fled their coastal villages, while more than 50,000 people in India also moved inland from the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea, government ministers and disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to ensure that a single life is not lost," said Bankim Chandra Hazra, a senior minister in India's West Bengal state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Kolkata airport closed on Sunday, while the Indian navy readied two ships with aid and medical supplies for "immediate deployment". (AFP)

    30 killed in strike on Rafah; Hamas targets Tel Aviv

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli air strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians and wounded dozens in an area in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah designated for the displaced, Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike took place in Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah, where thousands of people were taking shelter after many fled the eastern areas of the city where Israeli forces began a ground offensive over two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Palestinian health official said dozens of Palestinians were killed and wounded while Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, put the number of deaths at 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah was receiving an influx of casualties, and that other hospitals also were taking in a large number of patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from Israel. The final death toll was unclear as many wounded were in critical condition, medics said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the attack in Rafah as a "massacre", holding the United States responsible for aiding Israel with weapons and money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The air strikes burnt the tents, the tents are melting and the people's bodies are also melting," said one of the residents who arrived at the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military said eight projectiles were identified crossing from the area of Rafah, the southern tip of the Gaza Strip where Israel kept up operations despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop attacking the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of the projectiles were intercepted, it said. There were no reports of casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his war cabinet later on Sunday to discuss continued operations in Rafah. Israel argues that the UN court's ruling allows room for some military action there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on its Telegram channel, the Hamas al-Qassam Brigades said the rockets were launched in response to "Zionist massacres against civilians". (Reuters)

    670 now feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide: UN

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 670 people are assumed to have died in Papua New Guinea's massive landslide, the UN migration agency estimated on Sunday as rescue efforts continued.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media in the nation had previously estimated Friday's landslide had buried more than 300 people. But more than 48 hours later the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said the death toll may be more than double that, as the full extent of the destruction is still unclear and continuing dangerous conditions on the ground are hampering aid and rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only five bodies had been retrieved from the rubble so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency based its death toll estimates on information provided by officials at Yambali Village in the Enga province, who say more than 150 houses were buried in Friday's landslide, Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the agency's mission in Papua New Guinea said in an email statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Land is still sliding, rocks are falling, ground soil is cracking due to constant increased pressure and ground water is running thus the area is posing an extreme risk for everyone," Aktoprak said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 250 houses nearby have been abandoned by the inhabitants, who had taken temporary shelter with their relatives and friends, and some 1,250 people have been displaced, the agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are using digging sticks, spades, large agricultural forks to remove the bodies buried under the soil," Aktoprak said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IOM said an elementary school, small businesses and stalls, a guesthouse, and a petrol station were also buried.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN's Papua New Guinea office said five bodies were retrieved from an area where 50 to 60 homes had been destroyed, and a number of injured reported, including at least 20 women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOM said the community in this village was relatively young and it's feared that the most fatalities would be children of 15 years or younger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The geographic remoteness and the tough, hilly terrain is slowing rescue and aid efforts. (Reuters)

    Trump vows to free 'dark web' drug kingpin

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of US presidential candidate Donald Trump spar with opponents during the Libertarian Party's national convention in Washington. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754743_1_20240526140121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump appealed for support from the fringe Libertarian Party on Saturday, telling a rowdy crowd that if elected he would free from prison an American man who ran a website that sold millions of dollars in drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came at a contentious speech -- where the crowd often jeered and booed the ex-president -- at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, as he seeks support in the November US election against incumbent Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you vote for me, on day one, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht," Trump said, in a line that brought the rowdy crowd over to his side as cheers erupted from the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also vowed to put a libertarian in his cabinet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2015, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of masterminding the Silk Road "dark web" marketplace, which sold US$200 million in drugs to customers across the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ulbricht, who ran Silk Road under the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" and was also accused of commissioning five murders at a cost of US$650,000, was sentenced to two life sentences for narcotics distribution and criminal enterprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His case has become a famous cause in libertarian circles, who have decried the conviction as government overreach and against the principles of free markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has previously vowed to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the promise to free Ulbricht brought cheers, Trump's speech was far from the usual lovefest he presides over at his rallies, which typically attract hardcore supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conservative was variously booed as he tried to make common cause with the libertarians in the audience, many of whom view his policies as outside their extremely limited scope of what the government should be able to do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Libertarian Party should nominate Trump for president of the United States," he said to a mix of cheers and boos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only if you want to win. Maybe you don't want to win," Trump said as he at times sparred with the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The speech came after Trump rolled the dice on Thursday by making a campaign stop in deeply Democratic New York, seeking to woo Black and Latino voters whose support for Biden has shown signs of faltering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to compete for untraditional votes, you have to take risks," Trump advisor Jason Miller told news outlet Semafor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Libertarian Party routinely runs minor candidates that promote both popular limited-government ideas like marijuana legalization while simultaneously pushing fringe ideas like abolishing the federal tax collection agency or social security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its candidates have never posed serious threats in presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If they weren't interested in mixing it up by endorsing Trump, they were free to "keep getting your three percent every four years," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexico City, which is in the midst of a heatwave, recorded its highest-ever temperature on Saturday as thermostats hit 34.7 degrees Celsius, according to the National Meteorological Service (SMN).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The record high was recorded on Saturday afternoon at the Tacubaya observatory, the SMN said, after thermometers in the capital reached an earlier record of 34.3 degrees Celsius on May 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico warned on Wednesday that in the next two weeks intensifying heat could bring new record temperatures to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country has recorded 48 deaths due to intense heatwaves hitting the country since March, the government said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eastern coastal state of Veracruz recorded the highest number of deaths, with 14, followed by Tabasco, San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas with eight each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, Mexico reported a record 419 heat-related deaths in the hot season, which runs from March to October, in a country of 129 million people. (AFP)

    US rapper Nicki Minaj freed after Netherlands arrest

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans celebrate Nicky Minaj's release from custody in Amsterdam. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754715_1_20240526064212.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US rapper Nicki Minaj was detained at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on suspicion of possessing soft drugs before being released with a fine, Dutch media reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The singer was due to perform a show in Britain later on Saturday and posted images on social media of her being questioned by officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police confirmed that they had detained a 41-year-old American woman but declined to confirm directly that it was Minaj, as per their usual policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We never confirm the identity of a person in custody but I can confirm we have arrested a 41-year-old woman suspected of trying to export soft drugs to another country," said Robert Kapel, a military police spokesman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kapel later said the suspect had been released after the payment of a "reasonable" fine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no reason for us to keep her in custody any longer. We have all the information for our file. Case closed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rapper posted on X that authorities told her they had found cannabis in her luggage, which she said belonged to her security personnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Keep in mind they took my bags without consent. My security has already advised them those pre-rolls belong to him," she wrote on X, referring to marijuana joints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now they said I have to go five mins away to make a statement about my security to the police precinct," she said. "It's to try to make me late so that they can write negative stories."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her concert in Manchester scheduled for Saturday night had to be postponed. Promoter Live Nation said the performance will be rescheduled and tickets will be honoured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A common misconception outside the Netherlands is that dope is legal in the country, home to world-famous coffee shops (which actually sell pot) that are a huge draw for cannabis smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consumption of small quantities of cannabis is technically illegal but police choose not to enforce the law as part of a "tolerance" policy in place since the 1970s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transporting the drugs to another country is illegal. (AFP/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Saturday bombed a hardware superstore in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, killing at least four people and wounding 38, Ukraine officials said, in an attack condemned as "vile" by President Volodymyr Zelensky.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov said "unfortunately there are already four dead" and "38 wounded" after two guided Russian bombs hit the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of those killed "were men who worked in the hypermarket," Synegubov said earlier in a video posted on Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thick black smoke billowed from the gutted building of the Epitsentr DIY superstore in the northeastern outskirts of the city, as firefighters sprayed water on a blaze sparked by the strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still wearing her uniform, Lyubov, a cleaner at the hypermarket told how she escaped the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It happened all of a sudden. We didn't understand at first, everything went dark and everything started falling on our heads," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was good that my phone lit up, thanks to the flashlight I found where to go, but in front of us everything was burning already."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Epitsentr chain sells household and DIY goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of now, we know that more than 200 people could have been inside the hypermarket," Zelensky said on Telegram, condemning the daylight attack on an "obviously civilian" target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's TASS state news agency cited a security source as claiming that a missile strike destroyed a "military store and command post" inside the shopping centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regional governor said there was "no contact with some of the staff" and "according to our information, visitors could still be in the building."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just a few dozen kilometres from the border and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles. (AFP)

 At least 24 people were killed, most of them children, when a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in India on Saturday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage posted on social media showed a ferocious blaze engulfing a temporary structure, with black smoke pouring into the sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabhav Joshi, the district collector of Rajkot, in the western state of Gujarat, said that 24 people had died in the inferno, "mostly children," and another half-dozen were hospitalised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police have detained four persons associated with the game zone for questioning," he said. "We are trying to get more details about the owners of the facility."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 300 people were in the two-storey structure at the TRP amusement and theme park when the blaze broke out as it was a summer holiday weekend, Rajkot fire officer Ilesh Kher told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People got trapped as a temporary structure at the facility collapsed near the entrance, making it difficult for the people to come out," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flames spread rapidly because of its flammable material, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pictures from the scene showed a corrugated metal structure largely in ruins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gujarat is the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who posted on X: "Extremely distressed by the fire mishap in Rajkot. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. Prayers for the injured."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It took nearly an hour to douse the fire, with about a dozen ambulances carrying the injured to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fire department officials said a short-circuit was suspected as the cause and police at the site said the bodies of the dead were heavily burned, making identification difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pictures from an Instagram account that appears to belong to the facility show a lively gaming and recreational centre, with teenagers enjoying activities such as bowling, go-karting and trampolining. (AFP)
