<div class="itemFullText">
 China said Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the memorial service of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Foreign Ministry, Zhang, as President Xi Jinping's special representative, will attend the service in the capital Tehran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, huge crowds of Iranians thronged the streets of Tehran on Wednesday for the funeral procession of Raisi and his entourage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the city centre, mourners clutching portraits of Raisi gathered in and around the University of Tehran, where Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flanked by top officials, Khamenei said prayers over the coffins of the dead, who also included Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi's helicopter crashed into a fog-shrouded mountainside in northwestern Iran on Sunday as he headed back to the city of Tabriz after attending a ceremony on the border with Azerbaijan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A huge search and rescue operation was launched, involving help from Turkey, Russia and the European Union. Iranian state television announced Raisi's death early on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi, who was widely expected to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader, was 63.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the capital, huge banners have gone up hailing the late president as "the martyr of service", while others bade "farewell to the servant of the disadvantaged".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tehran residents received phone messages urging them to "attend the funeral of the martyr of service".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the university, the coffins will be driven to the huge Enghelab Square in the city centre and on to Azadi Square, state media said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Funeral rites for Raisi and his entourage began on Tuesday with processions through Tabriz and the Shiite clerical centre of Qom drawing tens of thousands of black-clad mourners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Tehran, the bodies will be taken to Iran's second city of Mashhad, Raisi's hometown in the northeast, where he will be buried on Thursday evening after funeral rites at the Imam Reza shrine. (AFP and agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Renowned Sherpa mountain guide Kami Rita scaled Mount Everest for a record 30th time on Wednesday, completing his second climb this month to the top of the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rita reached the 8,849-metre summit at 7:49am local time, according to Khim Lal Gautam, a Nepalese government official at Everest base camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first ascent of this year's climbing season was on May 12 guiding foreign clients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also climbed Mount Everest twice last year, setting the record for the most climbs of the world's highest mountain on the first and extending it less than a week later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His closest competitor for the most climbs of Mount Everest is fellow Sherpa guide Pasang Dawa, who has 27 successful ascents of the mountain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rita first climbed Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain. (AP)

    Schools, cars burn in N Caledonia before Macron visit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsonists torched schools and hundreds of cars overnight in New Caledonia, officials said on Wednesday, as French President Emmanuel Macron embarked on a surprise visit aiming to end nine days of deadly riots on the French Pacific archipelago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Macron left Paris on Tuesday on a flight to the troubled territory, a popular holiday destination where roads are now littered with charred vehicles, and scores of shops, schools and other buildings are in cinders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clashes have left six people dead and hundreds injured since unrest erupted on May 13 on the Pacific islands, home to 270,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities said the violence had eased since 1,050 troops, tactical police and national security reinforcements from Paris were deployed, including to "highly sensitive" areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, two primary schools and 300 cars in a dealership were torched in the territory's capital Noumea during the night, the mayor's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deadliest unrest in four decades has been blamed on French plans to give voting rights to thousands of non-indigenous residents, which Indigenous Kanaks say will dilute their votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An official close to the president said Macron aims to "listen to, talk and hold discussions with New Caledonian elected officials" in an attempt to restore order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He wants to "give answers to the many legitimate questions Caledonians are asking, both on the reconstruction side and the political side", the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But one Kanak manning an unofficial roadblock north of the capital Noumea said Macron needed to understand Indigenous opposition to the vote reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know why our fate is being discussed by people who don't even live here," said the 52-year-old, who gave only his first name Mike. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari added that Iran attaches great importance to its relationship with China, and is committed to enhancing cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British police are investigating the unexplained death of a man, who was charged earlier this month for allegedly helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the United Kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Matthew Trickett was due to appear in court on Friday to face charges under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British police said Trickett, who was 37, was found dead in a park in Maidenhead, west of London, on Sunday afternoon after a report from a member of the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said an investigation was ongoing into the death and an autopsy would be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett’s lawyer said he was "shocked" by the news and was supporting Trickett's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect was a former Royal Marine who'd worked for the UK border force. He was also the director of a security consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In early May, Trickett was arrested along with Peter Wai and Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Trade Office in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three men were granted bail and were due to appear in court on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When they were charged, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said it made serious representations to UK officials over the matter, saying it firmly rejected and strongly condemned "Britain's fabrication of the so-called case".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR Government, meanwhile, said it had "demanded the UK Government provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians evacuate Kamal Adwan hospital following an Israeli strike. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754129_1_20240522034215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Gaza's last two functioning hospitals, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan, are barely operational, doctors and the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday with the Israel-Hamas war now in its eighth month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hospital officials said Israeli forces had fired on the facilities and that snipers had been deployed near one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today marks the third day of the siege on Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza," said the hospital's acting director Dr Mohammad Saleh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He reported that Israeli forces had been "firing at the hospital buildings" and that "snipers" have taken up position in nearby houses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Saleh said the "southern wall" of the hospital "has been destroyed" and "all medical staff and patients" are inside the hospital wards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moving around the hospital was "extremely difficult," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But staff still had to transfer water "from the second building to the first one because the occupation (Israeli) forces hit the first building with a shell on the fifth floor yesterday (Monday), destroying the water tanks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva that "148 hospital staff, 22 patients and their companions are trapped inside" the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO regularly visited Al-Awda in April to deliver medical supplies and fuel, but Ghebreyesus also reported snipers aiming at the building and artillery hitting the fifth floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dounia Dekhili, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Gaza, said "nothing is coming in or out" of the hospital because of fears of sniper fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our operating theatre supervisor has been hiding for a few days, he can hear gunshots," Dekhili said after speaking to the man inside Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Saleh did not report any casualties, but said the episode was reminiscent of the last Israeli military operation in the area of the northern Gaza hospital, which is located next to the Jabalia refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Israeli forces besieged Al-Awda for days, killing two staff and detaining others, MSF reported at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has yet to comment on the operation in Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday also saw patients and staff being evacuated from another north Gaza hospital, Kamal Adwan, said its director Dr Hossam Abu Safia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the hospital is being evacuated of the wounded, patients, and medical staff," he said, adding that "there are several patients that the medical teams have not been able to evacuate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "the reception and emergency entrance gate of Kamal Adwan Hospital was targeted by an artillery shell from the Israeli army," as soldiers advanced towards the complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the Palestinian Territories, said on Tuesday from Jerusalem that the hospital's intensive care unit reception area had been hit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the moment, 20 health staff and 13 patients remain," Peeperkorn said, adding that "these are ... functional hospitals we cannot afford to lose," referring to both Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the only two functional hospitals remaining in northern Gaza. Ensuring their ability to deliver health services is imperative," Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli troops have previously raided other medical facilities in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, the territory's largest hospital, now reduced to rubble after a March operation, the WHO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military accuses Hamas of using hospitals as command centres to plan and launch attacks against its forces, a charge the militant group denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza Strip has been gripped by war since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,647 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's defence lawyers rested their case on Tuesday – without the former president following through on a vow to testify – as the judge planned jury deliberations in the historic criminal trial for early next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After approximately five weeks, 19 witnesses, reams of documents and sometimes salacious testimony, judgment day in the first ever trial of a former US president was drawing closer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York law means the trial has not been shown on television and experts are divided on whether the airing of Trump's dirty laundry is having much of a political impact. However, with a clash against President Joe Biden less than six months away, the looming jury verdict represents a moment of acute peril for the Republican.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Juan Merchan told jurors that closing arguments would take place next Tuesday when each side would make their pitch to the 12 New Yorkers who will ultimately decide Trump's fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will expect you will begin your deliberations hopefully at some point on Wednesday," Merchan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's lawyers have sought to undermine key testimony against the former president, who is accused of illegally covering up hush money paid to a porn star over an alleged encounter that could have derailed his successful 2016 White House bid against Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Robert Costello was grilled on emails he sent to prosecution star witness Michael Cohen after the FBI raided him in 2018, with Trump's lawyers seeking to undermine Cohen and the prosecution case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costello sparred with Merchan on Monday, prompting the magistrate to rebuke him for poor courtroom etiquette. Trump, in one of his regular tirades outside the courtroom, accused Merchan of being a "tyrant" in what he claimed was a "show trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Monday, both sides asked their final questions of Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and ultra-loyal fixer who eventually turned on his boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's lawyers set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lawyer Todd Blanche also probed Cohen's loyalty to Trump and then to the prosecution, looking to show jurors that Cohen is self-serving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche vied to goad Cohen, who has a reputation for a short temper that could have hurt him on the stand – but the witness largely maintained his composure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen's story generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Blanche finished with him, the prosecution returned for redirect, with prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asking Cohen what the whole experience has meant for him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire life has been turned upside down," Cohen said, emotion in his voice. "I lost my law licence, my financial security..., my family's happiness... just to name a few."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout the trial, which has upended the political and legal order, Trump has complained his 2024 election campaign for another White House term is being stymied by the weeks-long court proceedings, which he has to attend every day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did so again on Monday, complaining to journalists he's "not allowed to have anything to do with politics because I'm sitting in a very freezing cold, dark room for the last four weeks. It's very unfair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling the case politicised, a coterie of leading Republicans have stood in the wings behind him as he gives remarks to reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The growing list includes several lawmakers eyeing Trump's vice presidential pick, including Ohio Senator JD Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet despite the palace intrigue and courtroom drama, the charges ultimately hinge on financial records, and whether falsifying them was done with intent to sway the 2016 presidential vote. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Victims of a decades-long contaminated blood scandal that has killed about 3,000 people in Britain will start receiving final compensation payments this year, the government announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 30,000 people, including children, were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood between the 1970s and early 1990s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims are still dying from what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It follows similar scandals including the wrongful prosecution for fraud of hundreds of UK Post Office workers because of faulty software, and the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which falsely blamed football fans for the tragedy that killed 97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bombshell report released on Monday found the tainted blood affair was covered up by successive governments and health officials, and largely could have been avoided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issued a "wholehearted and unequivocal" apology and promised compensation for everyone affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Updating parliament on those plans on Tuesday, government minister John Glen said victims would receive interim payments of £210,000 (US$267,000) within 90 days, before the final scheme becomes operational.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our expectation is that final payments will start before the end of the year," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Glen said there was "no restriction" on the total cost of the package, which according to media reports could total more than £10 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friends, family members and carers of those infected will also be eligible for compensation, he announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compensation will be paid to the estate of any person who has died from the scandal and money will be distributed either in a lump sum or via regular payments, Glen added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Brian Langstaff's report, running to more than 2,500 pages, found a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It concluded that blood donors were not screened properly, the risk of AIDS was downplayed and too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak's official spokesman told reporters on Tuesday: "We must fundamentally rebalance the system so that we finally address this pattern so familiar from other inquiries like Hillsborough where innocent victims have to fight for decades just to be believed and heard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work together across government, our health services and civil society to ensure that nothing like this can ever happen in our country again." (AFP)

    1 dead after Singapore Airlines flight hits turbulence

<div class="itemFullText">
 One passenger was killed and 30 injured after a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence en route on Tuesday, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Bangkok, officials and the airline said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We deeply apologise for the traumatic experience that our passengers and crew members suffered on this flight," the airline said, adding it was working with Thai authorities to provide all necessary assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One male passenger died, Kittipong Kittikachorn, Director of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, said. Eighteen people have been hospitalised and 12 are being treated in hospitals, Singapore Airlines said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately possible to reconstruct the incident from publicly available tracking data, but a spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said it was analysing data at around 3:49 pm Hong Kong time, which shows the plane tilting upwards and return to its cruising altitude over the space of a minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger who was on the flight said that the incident involved the sensation of rising then falling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Suddenly the aircraft starts tilting up and there was shaking so I started bracing for what was happening, and very suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling," Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student on board the flight said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said with regard to data showing a drop in height, "our initial thinking is the turbulence event is prior to the standard descent from 37,000 to 31,000 feet. That appears to just be a flight level change in preparation for landing".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Boeing 777-300ER plane with 211 passengers and 18 crew was headed to Singapore when it made the emergency landing, the airline said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore news outlet CNA carried blurry pictures supplied by readers that it said appeared to be from the flight. They showed anxious passengers clinging to seats, with oxygen masks hanging from above, personal items strewn across the aisle and rubbish spilled on the floor of the cabin crew area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suvarnabhumi airport said the plane requested an emergency landing at 4:35 pm Hong Kong time and landed at 4:51 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognised as one of the world's leading airlines and is a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore Airlines has had seven accidents according to records by the Aviation Safety Network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said on Monday that the bodies of four hostages retrieved from Gaza last week were found in tunnels under Jabalia, where troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The army said last week it had recovered the bodies of Ron Benjamin, Yitzhak Gelerenter, Shani Louk, and Amit Buskila, all of whom it said had been killed in Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their remains were recovered "from underground tunnels in Jabalia in northern Gaza," the army said late on Monday in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a military operation, Israeli soldiers searched a suspected building in which a tunnel shaft was located, the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Soldiers then entered the underground tunnel route in a night operation and inside it conducted combat," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the fighting the soldiers "located the bodies of the hostages and rescued them from the tunnels," the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four were taken hostage during the attack on the Nova music festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of young people had gathered on October 6 and 7 to dance to electronic music at the event held near Re'im kibbutz close to the Gaza border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fighters from Hamas crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 360 people at the festival, Israeli officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nova festival victims accounted for nearly a third of the more than 1,170 people killed in the October 7 attack, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of the 252 people taken hostage that day, 124 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 35,562 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since early May the Israeli military has been engaged in renewed street battles in northern and central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the army said that the fighting in the northern town of Jabalia was "perhaps the fiercest" in over seven months of war. (AFP)

    UK PM 'sorry' for cover-up over infected blood scandal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday apologised to thousands of people infected with contaminated blood in a decades-long scandal that a damning report concluded was covered up and largely could have been avoided.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 30,000 people were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood in Britain between the 1970s and early 1990s, the Infected Blood Inquiry concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 3,000 people died, and more will follow, in what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am truly sorry," Sunak told the House of Commons, calling the findings of the long-awaited report "a day of shame for the British state."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Time and again people in positions of power and trust had the chance to stop the transmission of those infections and failed to do so," he added, promising "whatever it costs" to compensate victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total figure is expected to be above £10 billion (US$12 billion) when the government announces the package on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, running to more than 2,500 pages, laid bare a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one school where 122 pupils with haemophilia were given infected blood products between 1970 and 1987, only 30 now survive, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to report that it could largely, though not entirely, have been avoided," concluded its author, judge Brian Langstaff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His team found that successive governments and health professionals failed to mitigate risks despite it being apparent by the early 1980s that the cause of AIDS could be transmitted by blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blood donors were not screened properly and blood products were imported from abroad, including from the United States where drug users and prisoners were used for donations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Viewing the response of the NHS and of government overall, the answer to the question, 'Was there a cover-up?' is that there has been," the report stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not in the sense of a handful of people plotting in an orchestrated conspiracy to mislead, but in a way that was more subtle, more pervasive and more chilling in its implications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this way there has been a hiding of much of the truth," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of the 3,000 patients who died, many more were left with lifelong health problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Langstaff said that "the scale of what happened is horrifying" and said people's suffering had been compounded by repeated denials and false assurances that they had received good treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I have found is that disaster was no accident. People put their trust in doctors and the government to keep them safe and that trust was betrayed," Langstaff told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Theresa May launched the inquiry – one of the country's largest – in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campaigners hailed the report as the culmination of a decades-long struggle but noted that it came too late for many of the victims who will never see justice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andy Evans, chairman of the Tainted Blood campaign group, described the report as "momentous" and that he felt "validated and vindicated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been gaslit for generations... Sometimes we felt like we were shouting into the wind during the last 40 years," he told reporters. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen has stayed largely composed and on topic during cross-examination. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753952_1_20240521003251.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's trial on charges of covering up hush money payments to a porn star approached its final stages on Monday, with closing arguments expected early next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Due to an upcoming holiday weekend as well as legal squabbles over jury instructions among other yet undisclosed "issues," Judge Juan Merchan told the court "it's become apparent that we are not going to be able to sum up tomorrow" as he had hoped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's still unclear if the defence will present a case – they are not required to – or whether Trump himself will testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most experts say it is highly unlikely he will take the stand in his watershed criminal trial, the first ever of a former US president, as it would expose him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination by prosecutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche has raised the prospect his client could step up as a witness, telling the judge last week "that's another decision we need to consider."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the prosecution can rest, defence lawyers will first conclude grilling the state's star witness, Michael Cohen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer turned tormentor, recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over several days of questioning that continued on Monday, Trump's lawyers have set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche has also probed Cohen's loyalty both past and present, to Trump and the prosecution respectively, looking to show jurors that the former fixer is self-serving and willing to go to great lengths to accomplish his aims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen has said repeatedly he takes "responsibility" for his actions and has faced the consequences. Prior to the trial, including in his books, he had done little to hide his contempt for his former boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche has striven to ruffle Cohen, who has a reputation for a temper that could hurt him on the stand – but the witness has stayed largely composed and on topic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen's story has generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run. (AFP)

 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Monday won a legal bid to appeal against his extradition from Britain to the United States on espionage charges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  High Court judges Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson said Assange had grounds to challenge the UK government’s extradition order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange faces 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over his website’s publication of a trove of classified US documents almost 15 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian has spent the last five years in a British high-security prison after taking refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyers for Assange argued Monday the US provided “blatantly inadequate” assurances the WikiLeaks founder would have free press protections if extradited to America to face espionage charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said prosecutors had failed to guarantee that Assange, who is an Australian citizen and claims protections as a journalist for publishing US classified information, could rely on press protections of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday said he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in connection with their actions during the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Karim Khan said that he believes Netanyahu, his defence minister Yoav Gallant and three Hamas leaders — Yehya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh — were responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking of the Israeli actions, Khan said in a statement that “the effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare, together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza are acute, visible and widely known...they include malnutrition, dehydration, profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the Palestinian population, including babies, other children, and women.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the Hamas actions on October 7, he said he saw for himself "the devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today. Speaking with survivors, I heard how the love within a family, the deepest bonds between a parent and a child, were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness. These acts demand accountability.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iranian state media on Monday said President Ebrahim Raisi died after his helicopter crashed in a mountainous region of the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams had been scouring the area since Sunday afternoon after a helicopter carrying Raisi, the foreign minister and other officials had gone missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early Monday, relief workers located the missing helicopter, with state TV saying the president had died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The servant of Iranian nation, Ayatollah Ebrahim Raisi has achieved the highest level of martyrdom whilst serving the people," state television said on Monday, with Mehr news agency also saying he was dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State television broadcast photos of Raisi, with the voice of a man reciting the Koran playing in the background.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's vice president for executive affairs Mohsen Mansouri posted on X a Koranic verse used to express condolences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams had fought blizzards and difficult terrain through the night to reach the wreckage in East Azerbaijan province in the early hours of Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Turkish drone had identified a source of heat suspected to be the helicopter's wreckage and had shared the coordinates of the possible crash site with Iranian authorities, Anadolu news agency said earlier on X. Iranian state news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a US-made Bell 212 helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had earlier said it was "deeply concerned" about Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi after his helicopter went down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country. (Agencies)

    Spain pulls ambassador over Milei speech row

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain recalled its ambassador to Buenos Aires for consultations on Sunday after Argentina's President Javier Milei made derogatory comments about Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's wife during a far-right rally in Madrid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Milei had called Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez "corrupt" during a rally in Madrid organised by the far-right Vox party and attended by many of its international allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said he expected an apology from Milei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other ministers also condemned Milei's speech, in which he described socialism as "cursed and carcinogenic". Sanchez leads Spain's Socialist Party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With his behaviour, Milei has brought the relationship between Spain and Argentina to its most serious state in recent history," Albares said in a video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milei's visit broke with diplomatic protocol as he refused to meet Spain's King Felipe and Sanchez, instead preferring to promote his book alongside Vox leader Santiago Abascal at the party rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said in a post on social messaging app X that "attacks against family members of political leaders have no place in our culture".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain's main opposition party, the conservative People's Party (PP), refused to support Madrid's stance, with party sources saying that Sanchez should have provided explanations about the alleged corruption case weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A city court said in April it was looking into accusations of influence peddling and business corruption against Sanchez's wife, brought in a private complaint by Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, an anti-corruption activist group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Madrid's prosecuting authority later said it was appealing to have the case thrown out for lack of evidence. Sanchez decided to stay in office after five days of weighing his future once the probe against his wife was announced. (Reuters)

    Bezos' Blue Origin launches first flight since 2022

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin launched a six-person crew – including the first US Black astronaut candidate from the 1960s – from West Texas to the edge of space on Sunday, resuming its centerpiece space tourism business for the first time since its suborbital New Shepard rocket was grounded in 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I am ecstatic," Ed Dwight, who at age 90 years and eight months became the oldest person in space, said upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dwight and the other passengers, seated in a gumdrop-shaped capsule atop the rocket, were launched from Blue Origin facilities near the remote desert town of Van Horn. The rocket separated from the capsule, which then ascended further beyond the boundary of Earth's atmosphere to 105.7km, while the booster returned to land as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule then returned to Earth under parachutes, capping a mission lasting roughly 10 minutes. One of the capsule's three parachutes did not fully inflate, a hitch that may draw scrutiny before the rocket's next flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dwight was the first Black astronaut candidate who was picked by former US President John Kennedy in 1961 to train as an astronaut, but until now had never flown to space. Dwight stepped out of the capsule once it landed and thrust his fists into the air in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I really didn't need this in my life, but now I need it in my life," Dwight told a Blue Origin interviewer upon landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue Origin has now flown 37 private astronauts, including in 2021 "Star Trek" star William Shatner, who was 90 years and six months old at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The passengers, also including a venture capitalist and a pilot, were paying customers of Blue Origin's space tourism business, though Dwight's seat was sponsored by a space-focused nonprofit and a private foundation. Blue Origin has not disclosed how much it charges customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The grounding of New Shepard, Blue Origin's only active rocket, came after a mid-flight failure in September 2022 during an uncrewed research mission. A structural failure in the rocket's engine nozzle, the company concluded, forced the capsule full of science experiments to abort. (Reuters)

    Iran leader's helicopter crashes; fog hampers rescue

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday as it was crossing mountain terrain in heavy fog, an Iranian official told Reuters, and rescuers were struggling to reach the site of the incident.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official said the lives of Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian were "at risk following the helicopter crash", which happened on the way back from a visit to the border with Azerbaijan in Iran's northwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State TV quoted an official as saying that at least one passenger and one crew member had been in contact with rescuers. It also said the helicopter had been found, though Iran's Red Crescent denied this report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran's nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian state media said bad weather was the cause of the crash and was complicating rescue efforts. The chief of staff of Iran's army ordered all the resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guard to be put to use in search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is dark and it has started raining, but the search continues. Rescue teams have reached the area ... however, the rain has created mud, making the search difficult," a local reporter told state TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national broadcaster had earlier stopped all its regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country and, in a corner of the screen, live coverage of rescue teams deployed on foot in the mountainous area in heavy fog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rescue teams were expected to reach the probable site of the crash later on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neighbouring countries expressed concern and offered assistance in any rescue. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology to help Iran with the search.

    'Peaceful dialogue only way out of campus protests'

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753753_1_20240519102323.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Peaceful dialogue is the only way to address the concerns of students protesting around the world in solidarity with the people of Gaza amid the war between Israel and Hamas, a US economist and Columbia University scholar said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jeffrey Sachs made the remarks after pro-Palestinian protests that first began at Columbia University in New York City spread across some 140 campuses in the US, and subsequently reached Europe, Australia and India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been calls to stop the war and for universities to divest and cut ties with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are protests against an ongoing brutal war that Israel is waging in Gaza. And I think the protests in one form or another are going to continue and perhaps intensify if this war continues this way. So students are just seeing injustice and cruelty, and they are responding to it," Sachs told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while different schools have handled the protests in different ways, the use of violence to clamp down on demonstrators will only make matters worse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some universities responded very calmly, discussed with the students, the students appreciated the discussions, and the crisis was averted," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In other cases, the universities called in the police right away. And this escalated the tensions, and I think did unnecessary damage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scholar highlighted the importance for school administrators to listen to the students and set up designated areas for demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Students want respect. They're open for discussion. Administrators are right to keep the universities properly functioning, but that leaves a lot of room for peaceful discussion, deliberation and agreements," he said.

    I'll quit without Gaza plan: Israeli minister Gantz

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753733_1_20240519024945.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz demanded on Saturday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commit to an agreed vision for the Gaza conflict that would include stipulating who might rule the territory after the war with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gantz told a press conference he wanted the war cabinet to form a six-point plan by June 8. If his expectations are not met, he said, he will withdraw his centrist party from the conservative premier's broadened emergency coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz, a retired top Israeli general who opinion polls show is Netanyahu's most formidable political rival, gave no date for the prospective walkout but his challenge could increase strains on an increasingly unwieldy wartime government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu appears outflanked in his own inner war cabinet, where he, Gantz and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant alone have votes. On Wednesday, Gallant demanded clarity on post-war plans and for Netanyahu to forswear any military reoccupation of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the prime minister were to do that, he would risk angering ultra-nationalist coalition parties that have called for Gaza to be annexed and settled. Losing them could topple Netanyahu, who before the war failed to enlist more centrist partners, given his trial on corruption charges he denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personal and political considerations have begun to penetrate the Holy of Holies of Israel's national security," Gantz said. "A small minority has seized the bridge of the Israeli ship and is piloting it toward the rocky shoal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz said his proposed six-point plan would include bringing a temporary US-European-Arab-Palestinian system of civil administration for Gaza while Israel retains security control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also institute equitable national service for all Israelis, including ultra-Orthodox Jews, who are now exempted from the military draft and have two parties in Netanyahu's coalition determined to preserve the waiver. (Reuters)

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753723_1_20240518231332.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has announced that she has vetoed a draft law on foreign agents, Russia's state-run Tass news agency reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zourabichvili had said previously that she would veto the bill, which has sparked street protests, but her decision can be overridden by another vote in parliament, controlled by Georgia's ruling party and its allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I vetoed a Russian law. This law is Russian in its essence and spirit," Tass quoted her as telling a briefing. "It contradicts our constitution and all European standards, therefore it represents an obstacle to our European path."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tass quoted the president as saying her veto was legally competent, and that it would be handed over to parliament on Saturday. "This law must be repealed," it quoted her as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, is, however, widely expected to overturn the veto.

  Mass protests have swept through the Georgian capital Tbilisi over the past month since the first reading of the draft law was passed in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence, imposing disclosure requirements and fines for violations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opponents see the bill as a test of whether the country stays on a path towards integration with Europe or pivots back towards Russia. (Reuters)

 A man who attacked the elderly husband of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a hammer was jailed on Friday for 30 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  David DePape was convicted last year of breaking into the couple's San Francisco home and bludgeoning Paul Pelosi, who is 84.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the time of the October 2022 attack, Democrat Nancy Pelosi was second in line to the presidency and a regular target of far-right conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jurors heard how DePape – a Canadian former nudist activist who supported himself with occasional carpentry work – had initially planned to target Nancy Pelosi, planning to smash her kneecaps if she did not admit to her party's "lies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nancy Pelosi was not at home the night of the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors had asked the federal court in San Francisco to sentence DePape to 40 years in prison. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said on Friday that troops had recovered the bodies of three hostages in the war-torn Gaza Strip who had been "murdered" by their captors on October 7.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Last night, the Israel Defence Forces (army) rescued the bodies of our hostages Shani Louk, Amit Buskila and Itzhak Gelerenter," military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli citizens "were taken hostage during the Hamas massacre on October 7 and murdered" during the bloody attack on the Nova music festival, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of young people had gathered on October 6 and 7 to dance to electronic music at the festival, which was held near the Re'im kibbutz close to the Gaza border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fighters from Palestinian militant group Hamas crossed over and killed more than 360 people at the festival, Israeli officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This terrible loss is heart-breaking... We will return all of our hostages, the living and the deceased alike," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement after the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nova festival victims accounted for nearly a third of the around 1,170 people killed in the October 7 attack, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of the 252 people taken hostage that day, 125 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has launched a retaliatory offensive against Hamas that has killed at least 35,303 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hostages Families Forum said the recovery of the bodies was a "painful and stark reminder that we must swiftly bring back all our brothers and sisters from their cruel captivity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louk, a 22-year-old Israeli-German dual national, was identified in online videos showing a woman lying face down in the back of a pick-up truck filled with armed men, before being announced dead later in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last sign of life of Buskila, who was also captured while partying at the festival, was a call to her uncle Shimon, who heard his niece beg her kidnappers not to take her away. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="UN human rights chief Volker Turk this week has spoken separately to the leaders of the warring factions. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753624_1_20240517233220.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations warned on Friday that it had only received 12 percent of the US$2.7 billion being sought for war-wracked Sudan, adding that "famine is closing in."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced in Sudan since war broke out in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations says more than 1.4 million people have fled the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a catastrophically underfunded appeal," Jens Laerke, spokesman for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without more resources coming in fast, humanitarian organisations won't be able to scale up in time to stave off famine and prevent further deprivation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Sudan, half of the population, 25 million people, need humanitarian aid. Famine is closing in. Diseases are closing in. The fighting is closing in on civilians, especially in Darfur."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations has expressed growing concern in recent days over reports of heavy fighting in densely populated areas as the RSF seeks control of El-Fasher, the last major city in the western Darfur region not under its control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the time for donors to make good on pledges made, step up and help us help Sudan and be part of changing the current trajectory that's leading toward the cliff's edge. Don't be missing in action," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shible Sahbani, the UN's World Health Organisation representative in Sudan, said: "Thirteen months of war in Sudan, nine million people displaced which represent around 17 percent of the population and the largest internal displacement crisis in the world today.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This conflict has... nearly destroyed the health system which is almost collapsed now. Close to 16,000 people have died due to this war, 33,000 have been injured," she said, speaking from Port Sudan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sahbani said the real toll was "probably much higher."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF and Sudan's armed forces are seen as both wanting to secure a battleground victory and each side has received support from outside players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN human rights chief Volker Turk this week separately spoke to Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, president of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, Commander of the Rapid Support Forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He urged them both to act immediately - and publicly - to de-escalate the situation," UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, (far left), says the biggest concern is over the fuel needed to keep clinics and hospitals running. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753622_1_20240517225724.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation said on Friday that it has received no medical supplies in the Gaza Strip for 10 days as Israel pursues a new offensive against Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's closure of the Rafah crossing into Gaza has caused "a difficult situation," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said. "The last medical supplies that we got in Gaza was before May 6."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli troops entered the city of Rafah on May 7 to extend their offensive against Hamas over the militant group's attacks seven months earlier. They closed the Rafah crossing into Egypt that is crucial for humanitarian supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With UN agencies warning of a growing risk of famine in Gaza, the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings from Israel are also virtually shut down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jasarevic said the biggest concern was over fuel needed to keep clinics and hospitals running. Gaza's health facilities need up to 1.8 million litres of fuel a month to keep operating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said only 159,000 litres had entered Rafah since the border closure. "This is clearly not sufficient," he added, highlighting how only 13 out of 36 hospitals across the Palestinian territory were now "partially" operating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals still functioning are running out of fuel, and that puts so many lives at danger," said Jasarevic. "Current military operations in Rafah are putting countless lives at risk."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the death of more than 1,170 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures. Out of 252 people taken hostage, 128 are still held inside Gaza, but the army says 38 have died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 35,300 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the war broke out, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 French authorities said police on Friday shot dead a man armed with a knife and a crowbar who was trying to set fire to a synagogue in the northern city of Rouen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "National police in Rouen neutralised early this morning an armed individual who clearly wanted to set fire to the city's synagogue," Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources told French media the man "was armed with a knife and an iron bar, he approached police, who fired. The individual died."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local officials said there were no victims other than the attacker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The synagogue stands in the historic centre of the city, the capital of the northern region of Normandy that lies along the River Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two separate investigations have been opened, one into the fire at the synagogue and another into the circumstances of the death of the man killed by the police, Rouen prosecutors said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an investigation by French authorities is automatic whenever an individual is killed by the police. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials on Thursday said at least four people were killed in Texas as heavy storms with winds up to 160 kilometres per hour lashed the US state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Streets in downtown Houston were covered in glass from blown-out windows, video and photos posted to social media showed, as the National Weather Service warned of "severe" thunderstorms and possible tornadoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Downed trees and power lines littered residential areas, and around a million customers in the state had lost power -- including more than 800,000 in Harris County, where Houston is located.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mayor of Houston, John Whitmire, urged residents to avoid downtown, adding that public schools would be closed on Friday and asked non-essential workers to stay home as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mayor and the city's office of emergency management (OEM) were working with first responders to assess the damage, the city said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents were asked to stay off the roads and avoid unnecessary travel, according to the OEM. (AFP)

    Trump defence team accuse Cohen of lying

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's lawyer attacked the credibility of key witness Michael Cohen during a wide-ranging cross-examination Thursday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753520_1_20240517112333.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's lawyers accused the star prosecution witness in his hush money trial of lying to jurors, portraying Trump fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen on Thursday as a fabulist who was bent on seeing the presumptive Republican presidential nominee behind bars.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Defence attorney Todd Blanche pressed Cohen for hours with questions that focused as much on his misdeeds as on the case's specific allegations and tried to sow doubt in jurors’ minds about Cohen’s crucial testimony implicating the former US president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the past couple of days, Trump's defence team has attempted to portray Cohen — a onetime Trump loyalist who has become one of his biggest foes — as a media-obsessed opportunist who turned on the former president after he was denied a White House job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether the defence is successful in undermining Cohen's testimony could determine Trump's fate in the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the course of the trial's fourth week of testimony, Cohen described for jurors meetings and conversations he said he had with Trump about the alleged scheme to stifle stories about sex that threatened to torpedo Trump's 2016 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, who insists the prosecution is an effort to damage his campaign to reclaim the White House, says the payments to Cohen were properly categorised as legal expenses because Cohen was a lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's legal defence has suggested the former president was trying to protect his family, not his campaign, by squelching what he says were false, scurrilous claims. (AP)

    Violence continues in New Caledonia

<div class="itemFullText">
 The French government sent more police to the Pacific island of New Caledonia on Thursday and said it would crack down on rioters, hoping to restore order after three nights of upheaval in which four people have been killed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rioters angry with an electoral reform have burnt businesses, torched cars, looted shops and set up road barricades, causing a "dire situation" for access to medicine and food in the French-ruled Pacific island, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything's burning, people have literally no limits," New Caledonia student Olivia Iloa said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France has declared a state of emergency on the island, put at least 10 people under house arrest and banned TikTok. Numbers of police and gendarmes in New Caledonia will rise from 1,700 to 2,700 by Friday evening, with a small number of soldiers assisting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation in New Caledonia remains very tense, with looting, riots, fires, attacks which are unbearable," French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal told reporters. France will "show the utmost firmness towards looters and rioters" and toughen sanctions, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioting erupted over a new bill, adopted by lawmakers in Paris on Tuesday, that will let French residents who have lived in New Caledonia for 10 years vote in provincial elections. Some local leaders fear the move will dilute the indigenous Kanak vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electoral reform is the latest flashpoint in a decades-long tussle over France's role in the mineral-producing southwest Pacific island some 1,500 km east of Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government in Paris repeated past mistakes by not heeding warnings over the reform, said Dominique Fochi, secretary general of the Caledonian Union, a branch of the pro-independence FLNKS party which has called for calm but wants the reform shelved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We spoke in the void, and now things have exploded," Fochi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France annexed New Caledonia in 1853 and gave the colony the status of overseas territory in 1946. New Caledonia is the world's No 3 nickel miner but its nickel industry is in crisis. Economic disparities also fuelled the riots, said Fochi. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia does not have sufficient forces on the ground to make a major breakthrough in Ukraine after launching an offensive in the Kharkhiv region, a top Nato commander said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Russians don't have the numbers necessary to do a strategic breakthrough... more to the point they don't have the skill and the ability to do it," US General Christopher Cavoli, Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told journalists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been in very close contact with our Ukrainian colleagues and I'm confident that they will hold the line," Cavoli said after Ukraine's military briefed Nato's top brass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine said on Thursday it was trying to "stabilise" the front line in the northeast Kharkiv region, where Moscow has made its largest territorial gains in 18 months after launching a fast-moving offensive last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv was sending yet more reinforcements to the area, and the Ukrainian army said it had managed to partially halt Russia's advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow has seized 278 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory between May 9 and 15, according to calculations based on data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) – the largest territorial gain in a single operation since mid-December 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cavoli said Ukraine's allies were speeding major deliveries to Kyiv's forces after Washington passed a major aid package following months of delay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They're being shipped vast amounts of ammunition, vast amounts of short range air defence systems and significant amounts of armoured vehicles right now," he said. (AFP)

    US proposes reclassifying marijuana as low-risk drug

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden says nobody should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753469_1_20240517022033.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden's administration formally proposed on Thursday reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a historic shift that would bring federal policy more in line with public opinion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "No one should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. Period," Biden said in a video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Far too many lives have been upended because of a failed approach to marijuana and I'm committed to righting those wrongs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marijuana has been classified since 1970 as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) along with heroin, ecstasy and LSD, meaning it is deemed to have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it would be downgraded to a Schedule III drug under the proposal, along with drugs like ketamine and painkillers containing codeine, with a moderate to low likelihood of dependence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal to reclassify cannabis was unveiled by the Biden administration at the end of April and the Justice Department officially launched the process on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marijuana will remain a controlled substance until the process – which includes a public comment period and a potential hearing before a judge – is complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Biden became the first president to initiate a federal review of marijuana policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue is seen as a potential vote winner for Biden as he faces Republican Donald Trump in a tough election rematch this November, especially among younger people whom the Democratic incumbent is struggling to court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Pew Research Centre survey found 88 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legal for medical or recreational use. Just 11 percent said it should not be legal at all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cannabis was first outlawed at the federal level in 1937, a decision critics say was made largely along racist reasoning, as the drug was perceived as being intimately tied to jazz music and to Mexican immigrants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1970s brought the "War on Drugs," which likewise disproportionately hit minorities – before the medical marijuana movement took root in the 1990s, and in 2012, US states began to make recreational cannabis legal for adults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cannabis is today a multi-billion-dollar business in the United States, with more than half of all states having legalised recreational and medicinal cannabis use, including California and New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But since the drug remains a controlled substance at the national level, everyone involved is still technically breaking the law of the land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The classification makes it difficult for businesses to access banking services, stops federal funding for medical marijuana research and prevents interstate commerce, as well as federal regulation on best practices and protocols for marijuana. (AFP)

    US military says aid will flow into Gaza soon via pier

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753465_1_20240517003554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US military said on Thursday it expected around 500 tons of aid to enter Gaza in the coming days after an emergency pier was affixed to the shore in the war-ravaged territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Just a few hours ago, the pier was successfully affixed to the beach in Gaza," said Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're going to get about 500 tons in in the next couple of days. It's a pretty substantial amount, and it's spread out over multiple ships right now," Cooper told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The humanitarian assistance is being screened in Cyprus and loaded by truck. Once on land, it will "move quickly," being offloaded from the coast into Gaza within hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thousands of tons of aid are in the pipeline. We're seeing significant volumes of aid flow into Cyprus for further distribution," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden announced the emergency pier in March to address the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, where the United Nations has warned of famine with virtually the entire population displaced by the Israeli military action in response to the October 7 Hamas attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Built at a cost of at least US$320 million, the project is extraordinary in that such massive humanitarian efforts by the United States are usually in response to actions by hostile countries, not a US ally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States said it had coordinated the effort with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cooper said that around 1,000 US soldiers and sailors were involved in the operation but that they were only involved in the pier and not in delivery – which will be handled through the United Nations – or in combat between Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be no US military boots on the ground in Gaza," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three additional US military ships will join the relief effort in the coming days, with Britain also providing a vessel, Cooper said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Slovak interior minister on Thursday said that a “lone wolf” had been charged with attempted murder in the shooting that seriously wounded Prime Minister Robert Fico.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fico was in serious but stable condition on Thursday, a hospital official said, after the populist leader was hit multiple times in an attempt on his life that shook the small country and reverberated across the continent weeks before European elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attempted assassination shocked the small central European nation, with many blaming the attack in part on extreme political polarisation that has divided the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok on Wednesday said that an initial investigation found “a clear political motivation” behind the attack on Fico while he was attending a government meeting in a former coal mining town. However, he clarified this on Thursday, saying the suspect charged was a lone wolf who “did not belong to any political groups". (AP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753383_1_20240516135013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday took back a lecture hall from pro-Palestinian protesters who for hours occupied the building at the University of California, Irvine, then cleared a student encampment that stood for more than two weeks, witnesses said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers from about 10 nearby law-enforcement agencies converged on the campus after university officials requested help because protesters had occupied the lecture hall, leading the school to declare it a "violent protest," police and university officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About four hours later, police had ejected the protesters from both the lecture hall and the plaza that had been the site of the encampment, according to the university and Reuters witnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police have retaken the lecture hall," UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich said by telephone from the scene. "The plaza has been cleared by law-enforcement officers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vasich said there were a "minimal number of arrests" and characterised the protesters as "begrudgingly cooperative."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said all classes would be held remotely on Thursday, asking employees not to come to campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstration at Irvine, about 65km south of Los Angeles, is the latest in a series of campus protests across the United States over the war in Gaza in which activists have called for a ceasefire and the protection of civilian lives while demanding universities divest from Israeli interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UC Irvine protesters had established an encampment adjacent to the lecture hall on April 29 similar to those at other universities that have led to mass arrests and clashes with police elsewhere in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, 200 to 300 protesters took over the lecture hall at a time when no classes were in session, Vasich said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police responded in riot gear and formed a barricade while an officer on a loudspeaker warned the crowd that they had formed an unlawful assembly and risked arrest if they remained, the Orange County Register reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students chanted slogans, banged drums and hoisted banners, with rows of police standing nearby, Reuters witnessed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One banner hung from the building declared the site "Alex Odeh Hall," in honor of a Palestinian activist who was killed in a 1985 office bombing in the nearby city of Santa Ana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four adjacent research buildings with potentially hundreds of people inside were locked down, and those inside were instructed to shelter in place, Vasich said, though the university later altered that instruction and instead advised them to leave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly before nightfall, police moved in on the lecture hall, then engaged in a tense standoff with protesters at the encampment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Helmeted police wielding batons formed a line against protesters. Police gradually moved forward, pushing the students back every few minutes, until the officers rushed the crowd and made more arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before long most demonstrators had retreated, police held the otherwise empty plaza strewn with trash, and a few onlookers remained at the periphery. (Reuters)

    Canada wildfire doubles in size as thousands flee

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Residents of Fort McMurray head away from their fire-threatened homes. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753344_1_20240516093213.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A wildfire in Canada's major oil-producing region doubled in size as it drew closer to the city of Fort McMurray on Wednesday, but officials were hopeful shifting winds could soon push it away.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The blaze scorched almost 21,000 hectares of forest overnight as it came within 4.5 kilometres of the city, which was partly evacuated the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alberta Wildfire spokeswoman Christie Tucker told a briefing that cooler temperatures and calmer winds were expected to "push the fire away from Fort McMurray" as well as weaken it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis urged residents to "remain vigilant," noting that "wildfire conditions can change and deteriorate rapidly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For many, the fire has brought back terrifying memories of 2016 when a massive blaze gutted Fort McMurray, forcing its entire population of more than 90,000 to flee at a moment's notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm sure these memories will create fear and uncertainty for many in Fort McMurray and my sympathy is with everyone facing this situation, but safety must remain our top priority," said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, after 6,000 residents of four neighborhoods were ordered out on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many stores and schools were closed as a haze blanketed the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Freddy Saulnier, 51, who recently moved to Fort McMurray from New Brunswick on the Atlantic coast, says he is living "a nightmare."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staying in a hotel room after being ordered to leave his home, he says he can smell the smoke. This fire "is a beast," he said. "It's almost like watching a horror movie, you don't know if the killer is hiding behind a tree, and it's eerily quiet at night."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After being pulled from the front lines the day before, firefighters were back on Wednesday along with water bombers dropping retardant, while heavy equipment operators built fire guards southwest of the town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian authorities have been bracing for another possibly devastating wildfire season, after the country's worst-ever last year saw flames burning from coast to coast and charring more than 15 million hectares of land. (AFP)

    Biden, Trump to hold first presidential debate in June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CNN will host the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753306_1_20240516001511.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to hold a first presidential debate in June after the Democratic incumbent challenged his rival to "make my day" and the scandal-plagued Republican quickly responded he was ready to "rumble."
 <br>
  <br/>
  CNN announced it will hold the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Biden proposed a second debate for September and Trump accepted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, had set out his own terms for the debates with political showman Trump, such as time limits for speakers and having no live audience – a condition CNN said it had agreed to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first formal debate offer after months of stalling, the Democrat also shunned the traditional calendar proposed by the commission that has run debates since 1988 as he sought to exercise control over the format.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, accepted the dates even as he set out a starkly different vision with a larger venue for "excitement purposes" and accused the Democrat of being afraid of crowds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn't shown up for a debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal," Biden said in a video on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll even do it twice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also trolled Trump over his ongoing criminal hush money trial in New York, which features a mid-week break, adding: "So let's pick the dates Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CNN said in a statement that the debate would be held at its studios in Atlanta in the "crucial battleground state of Georgia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To ensure candidates may maximise the time allotted in the debate, no audience will be present. Moderators for the debate and additional details will be announced at a later date," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's debate offer appeared to show him taking the calculated risk of putting Trump back into American living rooms ahead of November's election, hoping it could reverse the Republican's poll lead in a series of battleground states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign has increasingly been trying to remind voters of what they say is the true face of the mercurial president who lost in 2020, amid what they fear is Trump "nostalgia" in some quarters – even as the Republican details his stark vision for an authoritarian second term in various interviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Trump has previously said he would debate his rival "anytime, anywhere" as he seeks to portray Biden as old and incapable of leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Biden's challenge, Trump – who avoided any debates with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination this year – said he was "ready to Rumble!!!" for the proposed June and September debates. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia Prime Minister Robert Fico was on Wednesday shot multiple times and rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries after a cabinet meeting, officials said, in an attack condemned by EU chiefs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fico, a populist leader accused of being Kremlin-friendly, has been prime minister since last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, after the government meeting in Handlova, there was an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Robert Fico," the government said in a post on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is currently being transported by helicopter to Banska Bystrica in a life-threatening condition, because it would take too long to get to Bratislava due to the necessity of an acute intervention," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fico was shot multiple times, said a post on his official Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We confirm the attack on the prime minister," police spokesman Matej Neumann said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handlova local hospital director Marta Eckhardtova said "Fico was brought into our hospital and he was treated at our vascular surgery clinic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was unable to describe his injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dennik N daily said its reporter heard several shots fired and then saw security guards lift the premier off the ground and into a car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The newspaper also reported that police had detained the suspected gunman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovak President Zuzana Caputova said she was "utterly shocked by today's brutal and reckless attack on Slovakia's prime minister... which I condemn in (the) strongest possible terms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wish him a lot of strength in this critical moment and early recovery," she said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also called the news of the attack "shocking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope the prime minister will get well as soon as possible. We must not tolerate violence, it must have no place in society," he said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: "Robert, my thoughts are with you in this very difficult moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as his current stint as premier, Fico also headed the government in 2006-10 and 2012-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since he was elected last October, Fico has made a string of remarks that have soured ties between Slovakia and neighbouring Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has notably questioned Ukraine's sovereignty and called for a compromise with Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also sparked mass protests with controversial changes, including a media law that critics say will undermine the impartiality of public television and radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference following the shooting, MP Lubos Blaha from Fico's Smer party lashed out against his critics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You, the liberal media, and progressive politicians are to blame. Robert Fico is fighting for his life because of your hatred," Blaha said. (AFP)

    Indonesia floods kill 67, rescuers search for missing

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers raced on Wednesday to find dozens of people still unaccounted for after flash floods and cold lava flow that inundated neighbourhoods and swept away houses over the weekend left 67people dead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hours of torrential rain on Saturday caused mud and rocks to flow into districts near one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, sweeping away dozens of houses and damaging roads and mosques.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national disaster agency chief Suharyanto on Wednesday said dozens remained missing, with the figure increasing periodically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers said many of the retrieved bodies were found in or around nearby rivers after locals were swept away by the deluge of volcanic material, mud and rain that tore through neighbourhoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy equipment was deployed to clear debris from the areas worst hit by flooding, which has affected transport access in six districts, said Suharyanto, who goes by one name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 3,300 people have been forced to evacuate from affected areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To aid the rescue effort, authorities on Wednesday deployed weather modification technology, the term Indonesian officials use for cloud seeding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this case, it is being used in a bid to make clouds rain earlier so the rainfall's intensity is weakened by the time it reaches the disaster-struck area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia is prone to landslides and floods during the rainy season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, about 24,000 people were evacuated and two children were killed in floods on Sumatra island, with environmental campaigners blaming deforestation caused by logging for worsening the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trees act as a natural defence against floods, slowing the rate at which water runs down hills and into rivers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)

    Biden plans $1 bn in new arms for Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A displaced Palestinian boy from Rafah arrives in Khan Yunis camp in Gaza. Nearly 450,000 people have been displaced from Rafah since May 6, according to the UN. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753223_1_20240515102851.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden's administration informed Congress on Tuesday of a $1 billion weapons package for Israel, official sources told AFP, a week after threatening to withhold some arms over concerns of a Rafah assault.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration informally notified the weapons package to Congress, which will need to approve it, a US official said, while a congressional aide who also requested anonymity said the weapons bought from US weapons makers amounted to around $1 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weapons would come out of a major $95 billion package recently approved by Congress in defense support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and the Biden administration has repeatedly said it planned to go ahead and appropriate the funds through purchases from US manufacturers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the deal comes a week after Biden warned he may withhold bombs and artillery shells to Israel if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went ahead in defiance of US warnings with an assault on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than one million Palestinians have taken shelter after half a year of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden administration also confirmed last week that for the first time it had halted a shipment including 2,000-pound bombs, fearing they would be used with devastating risks for civilians in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congress could still block the weapons sale to Israel, with left-leaning members of Biden's Democratic Party outraged by the toll on civilians in the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the overall package passed despite opposition from the left, with the rival Republican Party almost unanimously in support of arms for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Wall Street Journal first reported the new arms package. It said it could potentially include $700 million in tank ammunition and $500 million in tactical vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden administration, while increasingly critical of Israel, has made clear it will continue to support its ally's security and pointed to US assistance last month in shooting down Iranian drones launched in retaliation for a strike on a diplomatic facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are continuing to send military assistance, and we will ensure that Israel receives the full amount provided in the supplemental," Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, told reporters on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs because we do not believe they should be dropped in densely populated cities. We are talking to the Israeli government about this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the October 7 Hamas attack that triggered the massive Israeli retaliation, the Biden administration has twice cited emergency needs to avoid the regular 30-day review by Congress of military transfers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics also point out that the Biden administration has sent a regular flow of weapons unknown to the public as they fall below the threshold for congressional notification. (AFP)

    Riots rock France's New Caledonia over voting reform

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French MPs attend a debate on the constitutional bill aimed at enlarging the electorate of the overseas French territory of New Caledonia, at the French National Assembly in Paris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753219_1_20240515095233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person was killed, hundreds more were injured, shops were looted and public buildings torched during a second night of rioting in New Caledonia, authorities said on Wednesday, as anger over constitutional reforms from Paris boiled over.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Protests against the reform turned violent Monday night, with shots fired at security forces, vehicles torched and shops looted in the worst unrest the French overseas territory has seen since the 1980s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, authorities deployed a heavy security contingent, imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings and closed the main airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More than 130 arrests have been made and several dozen rioters have been taken into custody and will be brought before the courts," the French High Commission of the Republic in New Caledonia said in a statement early Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Describing the "serious public disturbances" as ongoing, the High Commission decried widespread looting and torching of businesses and public property, including schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that classes will remain scrapped until further notice and the main airport shut to commercial flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unrest flared as lawmakers in France debated a bill that would increase the number of people eligible to cast ballots in the territory's provincial elections, a change critics fear could marginalise Indigenous people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following lengthy and at times tense debates, the National Assembly in Paris adopted the reform shortly after midnight, by 351 votes to 153.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, French President Emmanuel Macron appealed for calm on all sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Noumea Accord of 1998, France vowed to gradually give more political power to the Pacific island territory of nearly 300,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the agreement, New Caledonia has held three referendums over its ties with France, all rejecting independence. But independence retains support, particularly among the Indigenous Kanak people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Noumea Accord has also meant that New Caledonia's voter lists have not been updated since 1998 -- meaning that island residents who arrived from mainland France or elsewhere in the past 25 years do not have the right to take part in provincial polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French government has branded the exclusion of one out of five people from voting as "absurd", while separatists fear that expanding voter lists would benefit pro-France politicians and reduce the weight of the Kanaks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai rights activist detained on royal defamation charges died on Tuesday while on hunger strike in custody, the kingdom's department of corrections said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Netiporn Sanae-sangkhom, an activist from the pro-democracy "Thaluwang" group, had been held in pre-trial detention since January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was charged under Thailand's tough royal insult laws over a royal motorcade protest in 2020 during the peak of the kingdom's youth-led pro-democracy movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the world's strictest lese-majeste laws protect King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each offence carrying a potential 15-year sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old went on hunger strike shortly after detention to protest against the Thai justice system, and was immediately transferred to the medical correctional hospital over health concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the statement released by the department of corrections, Netiporn – also known by her nickname "Boong" – suffered from weak legs and arms as well as anaemia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She refused "minerals and vitamins" given by the hospital, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She had a cardiac arrest on Tuesday morning and wasn't responsive to the treatment, which led her to die peacefully at 11:22 am (0422 GMT)," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the hospital will conduct an autopsy to identify the cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian regional branch of the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it was "deeply disturbed" by Netiporn's death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We call for transparent & impartial investigation into her death & care. Freedom of expression & peaceful assembly are fundamental rights," the office wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Human Rights Lawyer Association, there are at least two political prisoners in Thailand who went on hunger strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, two Thai hunger strikers held under royal insult law were given temporary release over health concerns. (AFP)

    Palestinians rally at historic villages in Israel

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people took part on Tuesday in an annual march through the ruins of villages that Palestinians were expelled from during the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wrapped in keffiyeh scarves and waving Palestinian flags, men and women rallied through the abandoned villages of Al-Kassayer and Al-Husha – many holding signs with the names of dozens of other demolished villages their families were displaced from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Your Independence Day is our catastrophe," reads the rallying slogan for the protest that took place as Israelis celebrated the 76th anniversary of the proclamation of the State of Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protest this year was taking place against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Gaza, where fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas has displaced the majority of the population, according to the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those marching on Tuesday was 88-year-old Abdul Rahman al-Sabah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described how members of the Haganah, a Zionist paramilitary group, forced his family out of Al-Kassayer, near the northern city of Haifa, when he was a child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They "blew up our village, Al-Kassayer, and the village of Al-Husha so that we would not return to them, and they planted mines," he said, his eyes glistening with tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family was displaced to the nearby town of Shefa-Amr.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we continued (going back), my mother and I, and groups from the village, because it was harvest season, and we wanted to live and eat," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had nothing, and whoever was caught by the Israelis was imprisoned."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinians remember this as the "Nakba", or catastrophe, when around 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the war that led to the creation of Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The descendants of the 160,000 Palestinians who managed to remain in what became Israel presently number about 1.4 million, around 20 percent of Israel's population. (AFP)

    Georgia passes so-called 'foreign influence' bill

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia's parliament on Tuesday adopted a controversial "foreign influence" law that has sparked weeks of mass protests against the measure, which Brussels has warned would undermine Tbilisi's European aspirations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers voted 84 to 30 in favour during the third and final reading of the law, which was widely denounced as mirroring repressive Russian legislation used to silence dissent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vote came as street protesters skirmished with riot police outside the building in the centre of the capital, where demonstrations have taken place over the last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scuffles had broken out inside the chamber earlier as opposition lawmakers clashed with members of the ruling Georgian Dream party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the bill is a symbol of the ex-Soviet republic's drift closer to Russia's orbit over recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 2,000 mainly young protesters gathered outside parliament and chanted "no to the Russian law," as news spread that lawmakers had adopted the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tbilisi has seen weeks of mass rallies over the bill that culminated on Saturday, when up to 100,000 people took to the streets in the largest anti-government rally in Georgia's recent history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU has said the law is "incompatible" with Georgia's longstanding bid to join the 27-nation bloc, while Washington has warned its adoption would signal Tbilisi's departure from the Western orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US Assistant Secretary of State, James O'Brien, on Tuesday met in Tbilisi with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, whose office said each had "expressed their concerns" over recent developments in Georgia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK Secretary of State for Defence, Grant Shapps, labelled the foreign influence law an act of "Russian interference in Georgia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov hit back, accusing the West of "undisguised interference in Georgia's internal affairs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said that he would be travelling on Tuesday to Georgia together with his counterparts from Iceland, Estonia and Latvia to express "our concerns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both protesters and the ruling Georgian Dream party have vowed not to back down and fresh rallies have been called.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some protesters say their ultimate goal is to vote out Georgian Dream, which has been in power since 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill requires NGOs and media outlets that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as bodies "pursuing the interests of a foreign power."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has used a similar law to silence public figures and organisations that disagree with or deviate from the Kremlin's views.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU on Tuesday repeated its position that the bill undermines Tbilisi's desire to move closer to the bloc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "EU member countries are very clear that if this law is adopted it will be a serious obstacle for Georgia in its European perspective," said its spokesman, Peter Stano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, Georgia was granted official EU candidacy, and Brussels is set to decide in December on the formal launch of accession talks – an unlikely prospect after the law's adoption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with the government, has vowed to veto the law, though Georgian Dream has enough lawmakers in parliament to override her veto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This law is taking away my future," 19-year-old protester Anano Plievi said outside parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am angry, and proud of all these people at the same time. We are going to keep going towards Europe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian society is staunchly anti-Kremlin. Georgia's bid for membership of the EU and NATO is enshrined in its constitution and – according to opinion polls – supported by a majority of the population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NGOs and government critics have reported months of intimidation and harassment in the run-up to the bill being reintroduced in a targeted campaign that has escalated amid the tensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian Dream has depicted the protesters as violent mobs, insisted it is committed to joining the EU, and said the bill is aimed at increasing transparency of NGO funding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The controversy surrounding the bill comes five months before a parliamentary election seen as a crucial democratic test for the Black Sea country. (AFP)

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin also confirmed the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit meant to reassure Ukrainians of continued American support and flow of weapons as Russia pummels the northeastern Kharkiv region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Marking his fourth visit to Kyiv since the start of the war in February 2022, Blinken arrived by overnight train from Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will aim to reassure Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of enduring American support and deliver a speech focused on Ukraine's future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has been on the back foot on the battlefield for months as Russian troops have slowly advanced, mainly in the Donetsk region to the south, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of troop manpower and artillery shells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's forces hold a significant advantage in manpower and munitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was trying to accelerate "the tempo of the deliveries" of weapons to Ukraine to help it reverse its disadvantage. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)

    Fierce fighting rocks Gaza after US warning of anarchy

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel battled Hamas in Gaza on Monday, including in far-southern Rafah, despite US warnings against a full-scale invasion of the crowded city and of the threat from post-war anarchy or insurgency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Clashes also raged in northern and central Gaza as Israel marked a sombre Memorial Day, followed by Independence Day from Monday night, more than seven months into the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israelis marked a moment's silence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that "our war of independence is not over yet. It continues even today... We are determined to win this struggle."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AFP correspondents in Gaza reported helicopter strikes and heavy artillery shelling in the east of Rafah, as well as battles in northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel last week defied a chorus of warnings -- including from top ally Washington which paused a shipment of bombs -- and sent tanks and troops into the east of Rafah to pursue militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city on the Egyptian border had been sheltering 1.4 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations, but Israel's military operation sparked an exodus of nearly 360,000 people from Rafah so far, said the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency warned that "no place is safe" in the territory, much of which has been reduced to a grey landscape of rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington had not seen any credible Israeli plan to protect civilians in Rafah, and that "we also haven't seen a plan for what happens the day after this war in Gaza ends".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel's on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas," he told NBC. (AFP)

    Cohen testifies against former boss in New York

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Michael Cohen, the star prosecution witness in the criminal trial of Donald Trump walks to court to testify. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753032_1_20240514004135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's one-time fixer and the star prosecution witness in the former president's historic criminal trial testified on Monday that he lied and bullied for his former boss who looked on silently.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Michael Cohen's testimony followed last week's court proceedings in which adult film star Stormy Daniels gave toe-curling detail about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump which is at the heart of the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer Cohen for a hush-money payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, when the story could have proved politically fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen if, as a lawyer-fixer for the property tycoon, he lied and bullied people on behalf of Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes... It was what was needed in order to accomplish the task," said Cohen who periodically glanced over at Trump who was slouched in his chair at the defendant's table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen spent just over 13 months in jail and a year and a half under house arrest after he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for lying to Congress and financial crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first weeks of the trial in New York, jurors have heard from witnesses that Cohen was a difficult character who cajoled others to get his way, while the defence counsel have painted him as a pathological liar and convicted criminal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen testified on Monday that he worked on both personal and corporate issues for Trump, who he claimed did not have an email address for fear of leaving a paper trial that could be used to prosecute him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006, has denied she threatened him if he did not buy her silence for US$130,000, a payment that prosecutors say Trump then covered up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial is taking place six months before the November election, when Trump will try to defeat Democratic President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During nearly eight hours over two days last week, Daniels walked the jury through the one-night stand she said she had with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament, and then the financial settlement she says ensued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump had sat impassively for much of Daniels's testimony, apparently cursing at times, and railing against proceedings in his comments to reporters as he entered and left the Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has denied having sex with Daniels, and his lawyers asked the judge for a mistrial on the grounds her testimony was "extremely prejudicial" in what is essentially a financial records and election-related case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Juan Merchan denied two mistrial requests last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan has imposed a gag order on Trump prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, and the ex-president -- who has traded insults with Daniels for years, calling her "horseface" and other crude slurs -- has not commented directly on her testimony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump spoke at a rally on a beach in New Jersey on Saturday and condemned the judge as "conflicted" and the prosecutor in the case, Alvin Bragg, as a "radical Democrat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he appeared to heed the gag order and avoided naming any witnesses in the case, including Cohen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has also been charged in Florida with allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House but that case has been postponed indefinitely. (AFP)

    Banks 'light the flame of the climate crisis'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Public concern over climate change has grown over recent years, but a new report says banks are still funding fossil fuels. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753031_1_20240514003047.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's biggest banks financed fossil fuels to the tune of US$705 billion in 2023, with US and Japanese lenders leading the way, an annual report by climate campaigners said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Since the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the top 60 banks have provided a total of US$6.9 trillion to the sector, according to the coalition's 15th annual report titled "Banking on Climate Chaos".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Financiers and investors of fossil fuels continue to light the flame of the climate crisis," said Tom BK Goldtooth, executive director of Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the report's authors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year's fossil fuel funding was down 9.5 percent from 2022, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some banks increased their exposure to climate risk, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JPMorgan was the top financier last year, providing US$41 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from 2022, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's Mizuho moved up to second place with US$37 billion, followed by Bank of America at US$33.7 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As one of the world's largest financiers to both traditional and clean energy companies, we help power today's global economy," said a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson in response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe our data reflects our activities more comprehensively and accurately than estimates by third parties. Reflecting our strategy of supporting the build-out of zero-carbon power, we set a net-zero aligned Energy Mix target and will disclose a clean energy supply financing ratio." (AFP)

    Rishi Sunak defends beleaguered Tories' track record

    <![CDATA[<img a="" alt="British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says he's " confident"="" consecutive="" fifth="" his="" in="" office.="" party="" photo:="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" reuters"="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753030_1_20240514002111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto" term="" win="" would=""/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted on Monday that his beleaguered governing Conservative party can win a general election despite polls consistently indicating the opposite, but refused to set a date for the vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunak mounted a defence of the Tories' 14 years in power and claimed that Britain would be less safe under Keir Starmer's Labour opposition, which is widely tipped to come back to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UK leader said he was "confident" his party would win a fifth consecutive term but conceded that Labour, out of government since 2010, may ultimately inflict defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm clear-eyed enough to admit that, yes, maybe they can depress their way to victory," Sunak said in a speech in central London, accusing Labour of "scaremongering" and "gaslighting".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't think it will work because at heart we are a nation of optimists," he added, before warning of several dangers himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak cited Russia's war in Europe, Iran's firing of missiles in the Middle East and the uncertainty posed by artificial intelligence as threats that needed to be tackled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also referred to "authoritarian" states, including and North Korea, Scottish nationalists who want to break away from the United Kingdom and "cancel culture".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our country stands at a crossroads," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous, yet most transformational, our country has ever known," Sunak added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak's speech at the right-wing Policy Exchange think-tank is a clear pre-election pitch to voters, as Labour increasingly puts flesh on the bones of its policies before a manifesto launch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its repeated attacks on Starmer also gave an indication of a potentially bitter and personal election battle ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Sunak refused again to be drawn on when he would call the vote, repeating his well-trodden line that he was aiming for the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He can go to the polls no later than January 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour has enjoyed double-digit leads over the Tories in surveys since the disastrous short-lived premiership of Liz Truss that ended in October 2022, and inflicted heavy losses on the Conservatives in local elections earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition -- overhauled since Starmer took over in the aftermath of Boris Johnson's election landslide for the Conservatives in 2019 -- has pledged to run the economy responsibly and hopes to match Sunak's recent pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the prime minister argued that only his party can protect Britons' safety and financial security, even after a decline in defence spending from 2010 to 2016 and the financial meltdown caused by Truss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are storms ahead. The dangers are all too real," said Sunak, a former finance minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But Britain can feel proud again. Britain can feel confident again. Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future."

  Asked about Sunak's speech, Starmer said security would be the "first priority" of a Labour administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the choice at the ballot box would be between "a changed Labour Party that puts the country first and party second" and "the chaos and division" of the Conservatives. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Indian citizens across 96 constituencies began casting their ballots on Monday as the country's gigantic, six-week-long election edges past its halfway mark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third straight term with an eye on winning a supermajority in Parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday’s polling in the fourth round of multi-phase national elections across nine states and one union territory will be pivotal for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crucial seats in Maharashtra and Bihar states, where the BJP governs in alliances with regional parties, were also up for grabs in this phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Bihar’s Samastipur city, hundreds of voters lined up at a polling station that opened at 7am amid tight security arrangements. Voters said they were concerned about rising food prices, lack of employment and economic development in the state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls predict a win for Modi and his BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million voters, more than 10 percent of the world’s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4. (AP)

    Pro-Palestinian students walk out at US graduation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of students walked out of Duke University's commencement ceremony on Sunday to protest its guest speaker, comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who has supported Israel throughout the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About 30 of the 7,000 students present left their seats, chanting “free Palestine” amid a mix of boos and cheers. Some waved the red, green, black and white Palestinian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos posted on social media also showed several attendees leaving the viewing stands, including a person wearing a keffiyeh, which can be an emblem of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others shouted "Jerry! Jerry!" as the actor received an honorary degree, and Seinfeld delivered his speech without major interruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A lot of you are thinking, 'I can't believe they invited this guy.' Too late," he said, after vowing to "defend" the concept of privilege.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand the depth of feeling in our community, and as we have all year, we respect the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement," said Duke spokesperson Frank Tramble in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The walkout at Duke's graduation was the latest manifestation of protests that have roiled US campuses as students call for universities to divest from arms suppliers and other companies profiting from the war, and amnesty for students and faculty who have been disciplined or fired for protesting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Emerson College in Boston, chants interrupted remarks by the school's president during its commencement ceremony on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students could be seen on a recording of the event walking across the stage to receive their degrees carried signs of their support for Palestinians, including one woman who unfurled a Palestinian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protests have prompted US universities such as Columbia in New York and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to cancel their main graduation ceremonies this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other colleges and universities have relocated or modified commencement ceremonies. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian officials on Monday said the death toll from flash floods and mudslides in Western Sumatra had risen to at least 41 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams were still searching for another 17 people who remain missing, authorities added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain on Saturday evening caused flash floods, landslides, and cold lava flow, which is a mixture of volcanic ash, rock debris and water that flows like mud, in three districts in West Sumatra province, according to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cold lava flow, known in Indonesia as a lahar, came from Mount Marapi, one of Sumatra's most active volcanoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said around 400 personnel, consisting of local rescuers, police, and military were deployed to search for the missing people on Monday, helped by excavators and drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rescue efforts that began on Sunday were complicated by damaged roads, making it difficult for rescuers to pass through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national disaster and management agency (BNPB) said almost 200 houses were damaged and 72 hectares of land, including rice fields, were affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 159 people had been evacuated to nearby school buildings, the BNPB said. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fighters of the Sudan Liberation Movement, a Sudanese rebel group active in Sudan's Darfur State which supports the army chief. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752900_1_20240513085956.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Clashes reignited between the Sudanese army and rival paramilitaries earlier this week in the key Darfur town of El-Fasher, the United Nations said on Sunday, killing at least 27 people in one day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses have reported air strikes, artillery fire and machine gun clashes battering the city since Friday, when an hours-long battle left an estimated 850 people displaced, according to the UN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also killed at least 27 that day, based on what the UN said were "unconfirmed reports", as the city suffers a near-total communications blackout, with medics and human rights defenders barely able to get news to the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighting has since continued, eyewitnesses said Sunday, reporting air strikes and artillery shelling that left "houses on fire", one resident told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to French medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), two children and a caregiver were killed in an intensive care unit Saturday following a nearby military air strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since April of last year, Sudan has been in the grips of a devastating war between the army, headed by the country's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in Darfur, a region about the size of France and home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  El-Fasher is the last major city in Darfur that is not under paramilitary control. The international community, including the UN and the United States, have for weeks warned against a looming offensive on the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MSF said Sunday that an air strike carried out by the army -- which maintains a functional monopoly on the skies -- landed 50 metres from the Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It caused the roof of the ICU to collapse, resulting in "the death of two children who remained receiving treatment there, as well as the death of at least one caregiver," according to a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The children who were killed were in a critical condition in our ICU, but their lives could have been saved," MSF's head of emergency operations Michel-Olivier Lacharite said. (AFP)

    Kremlin unveils military shakeup, new defence minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sergei Shoigu was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752884_1_20240513045138.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday moved to replace defence minister Sergei Shoigu in a major shake-up to Russia's military leadership more than two years into war with Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin proposed economist Andrey Belousov as Shoigu's replacement, according to a list of the ministerial nominations published by the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes at a key time in the conflict with Russian troops advancing in eastern Ukraine and having just launched a major new ground operation against the northeastern Kharkiv region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite a string of military setbacks in the first year of the campaign -- including the failure to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and retreats from the Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions -- Putin had stood by Shoigu until now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That included when Wagner paramilitary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched a bloody insurrection last year calling for Shoigu's removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining the timing of the decision, the Kremlin said it needed the defence ministry to stay "innovative".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The defence ministry must be absolutely open to innovation, to the introduction of all advanced ideas, to the creation of conditions for economic competitiveness," state media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying in a briefing on the appointments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The battlefield is won by whoever is more open to innovation," Peskov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is likely why the president has settled on the candidacy of Andrey Belousov," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belousov, who has no military background, has been one of Putin's most influential economic advisers over the last decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoigu, 68, was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012 and has had a decades-long political career of unmatched longevity in post-Soviet Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His presence at the centre of power in Moscow pre-dates that of Putin himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to Russia launching its full-scale military campaign on Ukraine in February 2022, he was seen as one of Putin's most trusted lieutenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were regularly photographed on nature retreats in the Siberian wilderness, hunting and fishing together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one famous snap from 2017 shared by the Kremlin, they are sitting bare-chested under the sun on a beach by a lake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Putin simultaneously issued decrees naming Shoigu as the new secretary of the Security Council, replacing his longstanding ally Nikolai Patrushev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin also said Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff, would stay in post overseeing daily military operations in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As for the military component, the appointment (of Belousov) will in no way change the current frame of reference," state media quoted Peskov as saying in a briefing on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff. He will continue his activities, and no changes are envisaged there at the moment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Along with Shoigu, Gerasimov had been targeted by a hardcore group of influential pro-offensive military bloggers for Moscow's perceived military failures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prigozhin, who marched on Moscow calling for the pair's removal, died in a plane crash weeks after his aborted mutiny.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is constitutionally required to name a new set of government ministers -- or reappoint existing ones -- following his victory in a March election devoid of opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers in Russia's rubber-stamp parliament need to approve the president's nominations, which they are set to do over the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The future of Patrushev, an arch-hawk who is sometimes seen as a possible successor to Putin, was unclear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate high-level reaction to the shake-up in Ukraine. (AFP)

    Thai police swoop on record drug haul

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities intercepted a tonne of crystal methamphetamine in one of the kingdom's biggest ever single seizures of the illegal drug, police said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The haul, with an estimated value of more than US$25 million on the international market, was found when officers stopped a pickup truck in central Nakhon Nayok province on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting National Police Chief Kittharath Punpetch said police, military and local officials had been monitoring several smuggling gangs and learned of a plan to move a large amount of the drug, commonly known by the street name "ice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kittharath told a news conference that 40 bags of the drug, weighing a tonne in total, were found in the truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its driver was arrested but investigators believe the head of the smuggling network is a Thai national based in a neighbouring country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kingdom is a major transit route for illicit drugs produced in the so-called "Golden Triangle" region where northern Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar is a major source of amphetamine, much of it produced in illegal labs in border areas controlled by ethnic minority armed groups. (AFP)

 The first living patient to receive a genetically modified pig kidney transplant has died two months after the procedure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Mass General is deeply saddened at the sudden passing of Mr. Rick Slayman. We have no indication that it was the result of his recent transplant," the Boston hospital said in a statement issued late on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a world first, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in March successfully transplanted the genetically edited pig kidney into Slayman, who was 62 years old at the time and suffering from end-stage kidney disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation," the hospital statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organ shortages are a chronic problem around the world and Mass General said in March that there were more than 1,400 patients on its waiting list for a kidney transplant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pig kidney used for the transplant was provided by a Massachusetts biotech company called eGenesis and had been modified to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes, according to the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slayman, who suffered from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, had received a transplanted human kidney in 2018, but it began to fail five years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the hospital announced the successful transplant in March, Slayman said he had agreed to the procedure "not only as a way to help (him), but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted on Mass General's website, his family said while they were "deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick" they took "great comfort knowing he inspired so many."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family said they were "comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 89,000 patients were on the national kidney waiting list as of March this year, according to a US health department website.
  <br/>

  On average, 17 people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant. (AFP)
