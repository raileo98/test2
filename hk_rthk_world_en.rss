    <![CDATA[<img alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the west not to let Ukraine use their munitions against targets within Russia.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that there would be "serious consequences" if Western countries allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to strike targets in Russia, as sought by Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin's warning came in response to calls within some Nato members as well as the alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg to allow Ukraine to use their arms to step up attacks on Russian soil, in an attempt to end more than two years of fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences," Putin said during a visit to Uzbekistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Europe, especially in small countries, they should be aware of what they are playing with," he said, noting that many European countries had "small territory" and a "dense population".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And this factor, which they should keep in mind before they talk about striking deep into Russian territory, is a serious thing," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that even if Ukraine's forces carried out the strikes, responsibility for them would lie with Western suppliers of the weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They want a global conflict," he said. Western countries have long been wary of being deemed a belligerent in the Ukraine conflict as they provide support to Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also said that while he believed Western military instructors were already in Ukraine operating undercover as mercenaries, any move by countries to send them officially would be another "escalation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's top commander announced Monday that talks were being held with France on sending military instructors to the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is another step towards a serious conflict in Europe, towards a global conflict," Putin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are specialists there under the guise of mercenaries," he said, adding that "this was nothing new".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they would be "defeated" by the Russian army, as "we will do what we think is necessary regardless of who is on the territory of Ukraine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Brussels that European countries were split on sending military instructors to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Countries including Germany oppose taking a step they fear could potentially drag them closer to direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU countries have trained 50,000 Ukrainian troops outside the war-torn country under a bloc-wide mission set up in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been pressing Western allies to provide longer-range missiles and other material for striking deeper into Russia in a bid to cripple its military and industrial capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the war now in its third year, Ukraine is also pleading for more weapons for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, notably seeking help to address its lack of air defence systems. (AFP)

File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755114_1_20240529004218.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis issued an extraordinary apology on Tuesday over his reported use of a gay slur in a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms and he extends his apologies to those who felt offended by the use of a term, reported by others," the Vatican said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a meeting with more than 250 bishops last week, the 87-year-old pontiff was said to have used an offensive term while expressing his opposition to openly homosexual men joining training colleges for priests, even if they committed to celibacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to two Italian newspapers, Francis said there was already too much "frociaggine" in seminaries, using an offensive Roman term which translates as "faggotry".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reports made headlines around the world and drew dismay from both LGTBQ groups and practising Catholics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some commentators suggested the Argentine pope did not know what he was saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Vatican statement did not confirm that he used the word but referenced newspaper articles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As he had the opportunity to state on several occasions: 'In the Church there is room for everyone, everyone! Nobody is useless, nobody is superfluous, there is space for everyone. Just as we are, all of us'," the statement said. (AFP)

    Report warns of growing number of extreme heat days

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Heat is the leading cause of climate-related death and global warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755111_1_20240528234629.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world experience an average of 26 more days of extreme heat over the last 12 months that would probably not have occurred without climate change, a report said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Heat is the leading cause of climate-related death and the report further points to the role of global warming in increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For this study, scientists used the years 1991 to 2020 to determine what temperatures counted as within the top 10 percent for each country over that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next, they looked at the 12 months to May 15, 2024, to establish how many days over that period experienced temperatures within -- or beyond -- the previous range.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, using peer-reviewed methods, they examined the influence of climate change on each of these excessively hot days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They concluded that "human-caused climate change added -- on average, across all places in the world -- 26 more days of extreme heat than there would have been without it".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report was published by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, the World Weather Attribution scientific network and the non-profit research organisation Climate Central.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2023 was the hottest year on record, according to the European Union's climate monitor, Copernicus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already this year, extreme heatwaves have afflicted swathes of the globe from Mexico to Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report said that in the last 12 months some 6.3 billion people -- roughly 80 percent of the global population -- experienced at least 31 days of what is classed as extreme heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, 76 extreme heatwaves were registered in 90 different countries on every continent except Antarctica.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five of the most affected nations were in Latin America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report said that without the influence of climate change, Suriname would have recorded an estimated 24 extreme heat days instead of 182; Ecuador 10 not 180; Guyana 33 not 174, El Salvador 15 not 163; and Panama 12 not 149.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(Extreme heat) is known to have killed tens of thousands of people over the last 12 months but the real number is likely in the hundreds of thousands or even millions," the Red Cross said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Flooding and hurricanes may capture the headlines but the impacts of extreme heat are equally deadly," said Jagan Chapagain, secretary general of the International Federation of the Red Cross. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning says Beijing called on all parties in the Gaza conflict to protect civilians and civilian facilities. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755051_1_20240528165602.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed "grave concern" over Israel's military operations in Rafah, where an Israeli strike killed dozens in a displaced persons camp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning also said China urged "all parties to protect civilians and civilian facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing also said it "strongly urges Israel to listen to the appeals of the international community and to stop its attacks on Rafah".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been calling for an immediate ceasefire since the start of the current Israel-Hamas war in October last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, President Xi Jinping has called for an international peace conference to resolve the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting later on Tuesday over Israel's operations in the southern Gaza border city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement centre, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation. Israel said it was looking into the "tragic accident".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,200 civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry run by Hamas. (AFP)

    India, Bangladesh count the cost of killer cyclone

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Torrrential rain brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's remote northeastern state of Mizoram, killing at least 12 people, while harsh weather hampers efforts to rescue those trapped, authorities said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, killing at least 16 and cutting power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bitter weather was holding up rescue efforts in Melthum, the site of the quarry outside the state capital of Aizawl, a state disaster management official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse," the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no immediate details of the number trapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rain in Mizoram, which borders Bangladesh, also unleashed landslides in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity lines in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather experts in Bangladesh said the deadly cyclone was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting they'd experienced, blaming climate change for the shift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of its land duration, it is one of the longest in the country's history," Azizur Rahman, director of the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department told AFP, adding it had battered the country for more than 36 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, cyclone Aila, which hammered Bangladesh in 2009, lasted around 34 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slow-moving – and therefore longer-lasting – storms bring greater destruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've seen many storms in my life but nothing like this cyclone," said Asma Khatun, an 80-year-old widow who lives with her son, a fisherman in Bangladesh's hard-hit coastal town of Patuakhali.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before, the storm came and went away... now it doesn't seem to go away. The incessant pouring and heavy wind kept us stuck for days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rahman said the cyclone triggered massive rains, with some cities receiving at least 200 millimetres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storm surges breached multiple embankments, meaning seawater flooded into farmland, damaged freshwater fish farms common along the coast, or corrupted drinking water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh's state minister for disaster Mohibbur Rahman said 3.75 million people had been affected by the cyclone, more than 35,000 homes were destroyed, and another 115,000 damaged. (Reuters/AFP)

    Egypt says soldier shot dead near Rafah crossing

<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of Egypt's security forces was killed in a shooting incident near the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and an investigation is under way, Egypt's military spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's military had earlier said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A few hours ago (Monday), a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians," the Israeli military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Monday, Egypt warned against compromising the security and safety of its security forces, a high-level source told Egypt's state-linked Al Qahera News, adding that Egypt would take necessary measures to prevent the incident from recurring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Egyptian soldier stationed on a watchtower had reacted to seeing an armoured vehicle carrying Israeli troops cross a boundary line near the border while the soldiers pursued and killed several Palestinians, two Egyptian security sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldier opened fire and Israeli forces fired back, killing him, the sources said, sparking an exchange of gunfire between the two sides. Several Israeli soldiers were wounded and the force fell back, and one Egyptian was wounded, the sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel seized control of the Rafah border crossing from the Gaza side of the border earlier this month as it stepped up its military offensive in the area, drawing strong criticism from Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt is concerned that Palestinians could be displaced from southern Gaza by the offensive, and has also repeatedly accused Israel of holding up deliveries of humanitarian aid to the territory, which Israel denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and have cooperated closely on security issues around the borders between Israel, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, and the Gaza Strip. They jointly upheld a blockade of Gaza after Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British lawmaker Lucy Allan, who had said she would not stand in the national election, was suspended from the governing Conservative Party on Monday after endorsing the candidate for the right-wing Reform UK party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This marks another setback for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has been on the campaign trail since calling a general election last week. Dozens of Conservative lawmakers have already said they won't be standing in the July 4 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Allan, 59, who was the Conservative member of parliament (MP) for the English town of Telford and has been an MP for nine years, said on social media that she was supporting Reform's Alan Adams to be the constituency's next MP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Conservative Party spokesperson said she had been suspended from the party with "immediate effect," adding that "a vote for Reform is a vote for (opposition Labour leader) Keir Starmer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A poll conducted by More in Common published a day after Sunak called the election on Wednesday showed 44 percent support for Labour and 27 percent for the Conservatives, with the right-wing Reform UK party at 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, former Conservative Party Deputy Chairman Lee Anderson, who was suspended from the party over accusations of Islamophobia, defected to Reform, which has Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage as its honorary president. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong," he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on "precise intelligence", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French President Emmanuel Macron said he was "outraged" over Israel's latest attacks. "These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians," he said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling against action in Rafah must be respected. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said its attempt to launch a new military reconnaissance satellite ended in failure on Monday when a newly developed rocket engine exploded in flight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The attempt came just hours after Pyongyang issued a warning that it would try to launch a satellite by June 4, in what would have been its second spy satellite in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead, the launch became the nuclear-armed North's latest failure, following two other fiery crashes last year. It successfully placed its first spy satellite in orbit in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage," the deputy director general of North Korea's National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a report carried by state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An intial analysis suggested that the cause was a newly developed liquid fuel rocket motor, but other possible causes were being investigated, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in South Korea and Japan had earlier reported that the launch seemed to have failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea fired the projectile on a southern path off its west coast at around 10.44pm, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JCS said it had detected a large amount of debris from the rocket in the sea just two minutes after launch, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The object launched by North Korea disappeared over the Yellow Sea, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding the government presumes nothing had entered the space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These launches are in violation of relevant security council resolutions and are a serious matter concerning the safety of our people," Hayashi said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to discuss speeding up talks for a trilateral free trade agreement, according to a joint statement released on Monday following their three-way summit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three countries also reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula at the ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit brought together Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three countries announced they would keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a trilateral free trade deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said they had agreed not to turn "economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the leaders had "decided to create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and investment, and to establish a safe supply chain".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After their talks, Li, Kishida and Yoon joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade among the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li called on relevant parties to exercise restraint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit, a move that violates United Nations sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would undermine regional and global peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said China, Japan and South Korea should properly handle sensitive issues and differences, and take care of each other's core interests and major concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the three leaders agreed to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and work together to tackle shared environmental, health and other issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trilateral cooperation system should be strengthened. We have decided to hold trilateral summits on a regular basis," Yoon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace, and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral meeting. (Xinhua & Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Papua New Guinea government on Monday said a landslide last Friday buried more than 2,000 people and that it had formally asked for international help.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government figure was around three times more than a United Nations’ estimate of 670.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Centre said the landslide “buried more than 2,000 people alive” and caused “major destruction”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A once-bustling remote hillside village in Enga province was almost wiped out when a chunk of Mount Mungalo collapsed in the early hours of Friday morning, burying scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said the number of possible deaths could change as rescue efforts were expected to continue for days. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Monday called on relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent further complications of the situation on the Korean Peninsula as China, South Korea and Japan kicked off a trilateral summit between the three countries in Seoul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the premier said all parties should play a constructive role in pushing forward the political settlement process of the Korean Peninsula issue, and maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noting the current situation on the Korean Peninsula continued to be tense, Li said all parties should commit to easing the situation and restarting dialogue at an early date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media also reported that Li urged South Korea and Japan to reject "protectionism" and economic decoupling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, business leaders from China, South Korea and Japan agreed to step up their trilateral cooperation in a bid to revitalise trade and stabilise supply chains, they said in a joint statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint statement said the three-way partnership had become a "more pressing task" after experiencing slowing economies in each country. (Xinhua/AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Tunisia will visit China this week, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leaders will from May 28 to June 1 "pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation will be Bahrain's King Hamad, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China continues its role a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and President Xi Jinping has called for an "international peace conference" to resolve the fighting. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tornado-spawning storms swept across parts of the central United States, killing at least a dozen people and leaving a trail of destruction as forecasters warned of more severe weather over the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least seven people, including children, were killed in Texas when a powerful tornado struck communities in the north central part of the state near the Oklahoma border on Saturday night, Ray Sappington, the sheriff of Cooke County, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two children, aged two and five, were among the victims, Sappington said. Numerous injuries were reported, Cooke County officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the scale of the disaster came into full view on Sunday, officials were wrapping up search and rescue operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sheriff said some of the many trailer homes in the hardest-hit area were "completely gone" and others had suffered massive damage from the storm which Sappington estimated left a quarter-mile wide path of destruction for three to four miles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tornado also crossed into Denton County, northwest of Dallas, on Saturday night, damaging homes and other property, and knocking down power lines. Officials said that "a number of individuals" with injuries were transported to area hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of customers were without power across a large swath of the country, including in Arkansas, Missouri and Texas on Sunday, according to poweroutages.us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in Arkansas also reported several storm-related fatalities, including one in Benton County, two in Marion County and a 73-year-old woman in Baxter county. Responding authorities described roads closed and clogged with debris, downed trees and power lines, homes and businesses destroyed, as well as numerous injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storms caused widespread damage and at least two fatalities in parts of Oklahoma, where officials activated an Emergency Operations Centre to coordinate efforts statewide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Indiana, adverse weather delayed the start of the famed Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, or Indy 500, car race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest bout of extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through a rural Iowa town, killing four people. (Reuters)

 North Korea has notified Japan of its plan to launch a rocket carrying a space satellite towards the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and shared a view that North Korea's satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would be in violation of UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officials agreed to demand North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an emailed release. (Reuters)

    Major cyclone hits Bangaldesh as almost a million flee

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People gather their belongings to head inland in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754785_1_20240526235020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An intense cyclone smashed into the low-lying coast of Bangladesh on Sunday, with nearly a million people fleeing inland for concrete storm shelters away from howling gales and crashing waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The severe Cyclone Remal has started crossing the Bangladesh coast," Bangladesh Meteorological Department Director Azizur Rahman said, adding the raging storm could continue hammering the coast until at least the early hours of Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have so far recorded maximum wind speeds of 90 kilometres per hour, but the wind speed may pick up more pace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters predicted gusts of up to 130 kilometres per hour, with heavy rain and winds also lashing neighbouring India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its densely populated coast has increased sharply, from one a year to as many as three, due to the impact of climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to four metres above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous," Bangladeshi senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level and high storm surges can devastate villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are terrified," said 35-year-old fisherman Yusuf Fakir at Kuakata, a town on the very southern tip of Bangladesh in the predicted route of the storm, speaking just before its arrival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 800,000 Bangladeshis fled their coastal villages, while more than 50,000 people in India also moved inland from the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea, government ministers and disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to ensure that a single life is not lost," said Bankim Chandra Hazra, a senior minister in India's West Bengal state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Kolkata airport closed on Sunday, while the Indian navy readied two ships with aid and medical supplies for "immediate deployment". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli air strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians and wounded dozens in an area in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah designated for the displaced, Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike took place in Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah, where thousands of people were taking shelter after many fled the eastern areas of the city where Israeli forces began a ground offensive over two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Palestinian health official said dozens of Palestinians were killed and wounded while Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, put the number of deaths at 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah was receiving an influx of casualties, and that other hospitals also were taking in a large number of patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from Israel. The final death toll was unclear as many wounded were in critical condition, medics said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the attack in Rafah as a "massacre", holding the United States responsible for aiding Israel with weapons and money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The air strikes burnt the tents, the tents are melting and the people's bodies are also melting," said one of the residents who arrived at the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military said eight projectiles were identified crossing from the area of Rafah, the southern tip of the Gaza Strip where Israel kept up operations despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop attacking the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of the projectiles were intercepted, it said. There were no reports of casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his war cabinet later on Sunday to discuss continued operations in Rafah. Israel argues that the UN court's ruling allows room for some military action there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on its Telegram channel, the Hamas al-Qassam Brigades said the rockets were launched in response to "Zionist massacres against civilians". (Reuters)

    670 now feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide: UN

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 670 people are assumed to have died in Papua New Guinea's massive landslide, the UN migration agency estimated on Sunday as rescue efforts continued.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media in the nation had previously estimated Friday's landslide had buried more than 300 people. But more than 48 hours later the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said the death toll may be more than double that, as the full extent of the destruction is still unclear and continuing dangerous conditions on the ground are hampering aid and rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only five bodies had been retrieved from the rubble so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency based its death toll estimates on information provided by officials at Yambali Village in the Enga province, who say more than 150 houses were buried in Friday's landslide, Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the agency's mission in Papua New Guinea said in an email statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Land is still sliding, rocks are falling, ground soil is cracking due to constant increased pressure and ground water is running thus the area is posing an extreme risk for everyone," Aktoprak said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 250 houses nearby have been abandoned by the inhabitants, who had taken temporary shelter with their relatives and friends, and some 1,250 people have been displaced, the agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are using digging sticks, spades, large agricultural forks to remove the bodies buried under the soil," Aktoprak said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IOM said an elementary school, small businesses and stalls, a guesthouse, and a petrol station were also buried.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN's Papua New Guinea office said five bodies were retrieved from an area where 50 to 60 homes had been destroyed, and a number of injured reported, including at least 20 women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOM said the community in this village was relatively young and it's feared that the most fatalities would be children of 15 years or younger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The geographic remoteness and the tough, hilly terrain is slowing rescue and aid efforts. (Reuters)

    Trump vows to free 'dark web' drug kingpin

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of US presidential candidate Donald Trump spar with opponents during the Libertarian Party's national convention in Washington. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754743_1_20240526140121.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump appealed for support from the fringe Libertarian Party on Saturday, telling a rowdy crowd that if elected he would free from prison an American man who ran a website that sold millions of dollars in drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came at a contentious speech -- where the crowd often jeered and booed the ex-president -- at the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, as he seeks support in the November US election against incumbent Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you vote for me, on day one, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht," Trump said, in a line that brought the rowdy crowd over to his side as cheers erupted from the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also vowed to put a libertarian in his cabinet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2015, Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of masterminding the Silk Road "dark web" marketplace, which sold US$200 million in drugs to customers across the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ulbricht, who ran Silk Road under the alias "Dread Pirate Roberts" and was also accused of commissioning five murders at a cost of US$650,000, was sentenced to two life sentences for narcotics distribution and criminal enterprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His case has become a famous cause in libertarian circles, who have decried the conviction as government overreach and against the principles of free markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has previously vowed to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the promise to free Ulbricht brought cheers, Trump's speech was far from the usual lovefest he presides over at his rallies, which typically attract hardcore supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conservative was variously booed as he tried to make common cause with the libertarians in the audience, many of whom view his policies as outside their extremely limited scope of what the government should be able to do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Libertarian Party should nominate Trump for president of the United States," he said to a mix of cheers and boos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only if you want to win. Maybe you don't want to win," Trump said as he at times sparred with the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The speech came after Trump rolled the dice on Thursday by making a campaign stop in deeply Democratic New York, seeking to woo Black and Latino voters whose support for Biden has shown signs of faltering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to compete for untraditional votes, you have to take risks," Trump advisor Jason Miller told news outlet Semafor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Libertarian Party routinely runs minor candidates that promote both popular limited-government ideas like marijuana legalization while simultaneously pushing fringe ideas like abolishing the federal tax collection agency or social security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its candidates have never posed serious threats in presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If they weren't interested in mixing it up by endorsing Trump, they were free to "keep getting your three percent every four years," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexico City, which is in the midst of a heatwave, recorded its highest-ever temperature on Saturday as thermostats hit 34.7 degrees Celsius, according to the National Meteorological Service (SMN).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The record high was recorded on Saturday afternoon at the Tacubaya observatory, the SMN said, after thermometers in the capital reached an earlier record of 34.3 degrees Celsius on May 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico warned on Wednesday that in the next two weeks intensifying heat could bring new record temperatures to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country has recorded 48 deaths due to intense heatwaves hitting the country since March, the government said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eastern coastal state of Veracruz recorded the highest number of deaths, with 14, followed by Tabasco, San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas with eight each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, Mexico reported a record 419 heat-related deaths in the hot season, which runs from March to October, in a country of 129 million people. (AFP)

    US rapper Nicki Minaj freed after Netherlands arrest

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans celebrate Nicky Minaj's release from custody in Amsterdam. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754715_1_20240526064212.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US rapper Nicki Minaj was detained at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on suspicion of possessing soft drugs before being released with a fine, Dutch media reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The singer was due to perform a show in Britain later on Saturday and posted images on social media of her being questioned by officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police confirmed that they had detained a 41-year-old American woman but declined to confirm directly that it was Minaj, as per their usual policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We never confirm the identity of a person in custody but I can confirm we have arrested a 41-year-old woman suspected of trying to export soft drugs to another country," said Robert Kapel, a military police spokesman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kapel later said the suspect had been released after the payment of a "reasonable" fine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no reason for us to keep her in custody any longer. We have all the information for our file. Case closed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rapper posted on X that authorities told her they had found cannabis in her luggage, which she said belonged to her security personnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Keep in mind they took my bags without consent. My security has already advised them those pre-rolls belong to him," she wrote on X, referring to marijuana joints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now they said I have to go five mins away to make a statement about my security to the police precinct," she said. "It's to try to make me late so that they can write negative stories."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her concert in Manchester scheduled for Saturday night had to be postponed. Promoter Live Nation said the performance will be rescheduled and tickets will be honoured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A common misconception outside the Netherlands is that dope is legal in the country, home to world-famous coffee shops (which actually sell pot) that are a huge draw for cannabis smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consumption of small quantities of cannabis is technically illegal but police choose not to enforce the law as part of a "tolerance" policy in place since the 1970s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transporting the drugs to another country is illegal. (AFP/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Saturday bombed a hardware superstore in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, killing at least four people and wounding 38, Ukraine officials said, in an attack condemned as "vile" by President Volodymyr Zelensky.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov said "unfortunately there are already four dead" and "38 wounded" after two guided Russian bombs hit the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of those killed "were men who worked in the hypermarket," Synegubov said earlier in a video posted on Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thick black smoke billowed from the gutted building of the Epitsentr DIY superstore in the northeastern outskirts of the city, as firefighters sprayed water on a blaze sparked by the strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still wearing her uniform, Lyubov, a cleaner at the hypermarket told how she escaped the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It happened all of a sudden. We didn't understand at first, everything went dark and everything started falling on our heads," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was good that my phone lit up, thanks to the flashlight I found where to go, but in front of us everything was burning already."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Epitsentr chain sells household and DIY goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of now, we know that more than 200 people could have been inside the hypermarket," Zelensky said on Telegram, condemning the daylight attack on an "obviously civilian" target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's TASS state news agency cited a security source as claiming that a missile strike destroyed a "military store and command post" inside the shopping centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regional governor said there was "no contact with some of the staff" and "according to our information, visitors could still be in the building."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just a few dozen kilometres from the border and regularly comes under attack from Russian missiles. (AFP)

    At least 24 dead, mostly children, in India fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 24 people were killed, most of them children, when a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in India on Saturday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage posted on social media showed a ferocious blaze engulfing a temporary structure, with black smoke pouring into the sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabhav Joshi, the district collector of Rajkot, in the western state of Gujarat, said that 24 people had died in the inferno, "mostly children," and another half-dozen were hospitalised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police have detained four persons associated with the game zone for questioning," he said. "We are trying to get more details about the owners of the facility."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 300 people were in the two-storey structure at the TRP amusement and theme park when the blaze broke out as it was a summer holiday weekend, Rajkot fire officer Ilesh Kher told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People got trapped as a temporary structure at the facility collapsed near the entrance, making it difficult for the people to come out," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flames spread rapidly because of its flammable material, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pictures from the scene showed a corrugated metal structure largely in ruins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gujarat is the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who posted on X: "Extremely distressed by the fire mishap in Rajkot. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. Prayers for the injured."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It took nearly an hour to douse the fire, with about a dozen ambulances carrying the injured to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fire department officials said a short-circuit was suspected as the cause and police at the site said the bodies of the dead were heavily burned, making identification difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pictures from an Instagram account that appears to belong to the facility show a lively gaming and recreational centre, with teenagers enjoying activities such as bowling, go-karting and trampolining. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A tiny NASA satellite was launched on Saturday from New Zealand with the mission of improving climate change prediction by measuring heat escaping from Earth's poles for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This new information – and we've never had it before – will improve our ability to model what's happening in the poles, what's happening in climate," Nasa's earth sciences research director Karen St Germain told a recent news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The satellite, which is the size of a shoe box, was launched by an Electron rocket, built by a company called Rocket Lab, which lifted off from Mahia in the north of New Zealand. The overall mission is called Prefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company is later to launch a similar satellite of its own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will serve to take infrared measurements far above the Arctic and Antarctic so as to measure directly the heat that the poles release into space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is critical because it actually helps to balance the excess heat that's received in the tropical regions and really regulate the earth's temperature," said Tristan L'Ecuyer, a mission researcher affiliated with the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And the process of getting the heat from the tropical regions to the polar regions is actually what drives all of our weather around the planet," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Prefire, Nasa aims to understand how clouds, humidity or the melting of ice into water affects this heat loss from the poles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Until now the models that climate change scientists used to gauge heat loss were based on theories rather than real observations, said L'Ecuyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully we'll be able to improve our ability to simulate what sea level rise might look like in the future and also how the polar climate change is going to affect the weather systems around the planet," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Small satellites like this one are a low-cost way to answer very specific scientific questions, said St Germain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Larger satellites can be thought of as "generalists" and the small ones as "specialists," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "NASA needs both," said St Germain. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli official said on Saturday the government had an "intention" to renew "this week" talks aimed at reaching a hostage release deal in Gaza, after a meeting in Paris between US and Israeli officials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There is an intention to renew the talks this week and there is an agreement," the official said, on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli official did not elaborate on the agreement, but Israeli media reported that Mossad chief David Barnea had agreed during meetings in Paris with mediators CIA Director Bill Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani on a new framework for the stalled negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top US diplomat Antony Blinken also spoke with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz about new efforts to achieve a ceasefire and reopen the Rafah border crossing, Washington said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Talks aimed at reaching a hostage release and truce deal in the Gaza Strip ground to a halt this month after Israel launched a military operation in the territory's far-southern city of Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,903 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to data from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Uvalde families sue 'Call of Duty' gamemaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Floral tributes are placed outside the school in Uvalde after the 2022 shooting. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754667_1_20240525151710.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Families of the victims of the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, filed two lawsuits on Friday against Instagram's parent company Meta, Activision Blizzard and its parent Microsoft and the gunmaker Daniel Defense, claiming they cooperated to market dangerous weapons to impressionable teens such as the Uvalde shooter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Together, the wrongful death complaints argue that Daniel Defense – a Georgia-based gun manufacturer – used Instagram and Activision's video game Call of Duty to market its assault-style rifles to teenage boys, while Meta and Microsoft facilitated the strategy with lax oversight and no regard for the consequences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meta, Microsoft and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, a lobbying group representing the video game industry, said many other countries have similar levels of video game playing but less gun violence than the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," the group said in a statement. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one of the deadliest school shootings in history, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when an 18-year-old gunman armed with a Daniel Defense rifle entered Robb Elementary School and barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms with dozens of students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaints were filed on the two-year anniversary of the massacre by Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the same law firm that reached a US$73 million settlement with rifle manufacturer Remington in 2022 on behalf of families of children killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses Meta's Instagram of giving gun manufacturers "an unsupervised channel to speak directly to minors, in their homes, at school, even in the middle of the night," with only token oversight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint also alleges that Activision's popular warfare game Call of Duty "creates a vividly realistic and addicting theatre of violence in which teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease," using real-life weapons as models for the game's firearms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second lawsuit, filed in Uvalde County District Court, accuses Daniel Defense of deliberately aiming its ads at adolescent boys in an effort to secure lifelong customers. (Reuters)

    Alec Baldwin set to face trial over movie shooting

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alec Baldwin will go on trial in July. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754642_1_20240525103314.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico judge on Friday rejected Alec Baldwin's bid to dismiss an involuntary manslaughter charge for the 2021 shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, opening the way for an unprecedented trial of a Hollywood actor for an on-set death.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Baldwin's lawyers argued at a May 17 hearing that a grand jury indictment of the actor was "a sham" as prosecutors failed to tell jurors they could question defence witnesses and stopped them hearing evidence helpful to the actor's case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among her arguments in a court filing, district court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said she did not find prosecutorial bad faith in the grand jury, nor error in jury instructions and prosecutors adequately advised jurors regarding a letter from Baldwin's legal team listing defence jurors they could call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The court finds no error in the actions taken by the prosecutor vis-a-vi the reading of the evidence letter," Marlowe Sommer said in the filing
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor now faces a July 10 trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hutchins was shot with a live round after Baldwin pointed a gun at her as she set up a camera shot on a movie set near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The "30 Rock" actor maintains he did not pull the trigger, an assertion that has become central to the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much of the differences between prosecution and defence positions are factual disputes and that is the type of case juries are meant to decide, said business and entertainment trial litigator Tre Lovell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At trial, Baldwin’s legal team must convince Santa Fe jurors there was a cascading failure in set firearms safety before the weapon was put in Baldwin’s hand,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey has argued in court filings that Baldwin broke firearm safety rules by pointing the gun at Hutchins, cocking it and pulling the trigger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sommer sentenced "Rust" armorer Hannah Gutierrez to 18 months prison in April after a Santa Fe jury found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter for loading the live round into the reproduction Colt Single Action Army revolver Baldwin was using. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 "Black Dog," about a man released from prison who returns home to his remote town in China to rid it of stray dogs before the Olympics, only to befriend one of them, won the Cannes Film Festival's "Un Certain Regard" competition on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eddie Peng, who stars as Lang in the film by director Guan Hu, attended the ceremony at Cannes along with greyhound Xin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the second prize in one day for Xin, who donned the Palm Dog red collar after being picked for the Grand Jury Prize at a separate ceremony celebrating canine performances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Un Certain Regard" jury prize went to the French film "The Story of Souleymane," director Boris Lojkine's feature about a Guinean immigrant's struggle to survive in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best director prize was given to both Italy's Roberto Minervini for "The Damned" and Zambian-Welsh auteur Rungano Nyoni for "On Becoming a Guinea Fowl," while "Norah," by Saudi Arabian director Tawfik Alzaidi, received a special mention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan headed this year's five-strong jury for the competition focused on arthouse films that runs parallel to the main competition, the Palme d'Or.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 18 films in total competing for the prize. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States on Friday announced a fresh tranche of military aid for Ukraine, including ammunition, missiles, mines and artillery rounds as Russia presses its assault on the Kharkiv region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has been battling back in Kharkiv since May 10, when thousands of Moscow's troops stormed the border, making their biggest territorial advances in 18 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States is announcing today a significant new drawdown of weapons and equipment for Ukraine to support the brave Ukrainian people as they defend their country," said Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This 275 million dollar package, which is part of our efforts to help Ukraine repel Russia's assault near Kharkiv, contains urgently needed capabilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, US lawmakers passed a long-delayed US$61 billion military aid deal for Kyiv after months of squabbling in Congress as Ukrainian forces suffered setbacks on the battlefield due to ammunition and funding shortages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, President Joe Biden has ordered five tranches of military aid to be sent to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Assistance from previous packages has already made it to the front lines, and we will move this new assistance as quickly as possible," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strikes on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, killed at least seven people on Thursday, local authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 11,000 people in the wider region have been evacuated since Russia began its new offensive, according to local governor Oleg Synegubov. (AFP)

    SpaceX mega rocket Starship's next launch on June 5

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The last test took place on March 14, when Starship flew halfway around the planet. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754608_1_20240525004618.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Starship, the world's most powerful rocket, is set for its next test flight on June 5, SpaceX announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The launch window from the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas opens at 7:00 am local time (1200 GMT), pending regulatory approval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be the fourth test for the sleek mega rocket, which is vital to Nasa's plans for landing astronauts on the Moon later this decade, and to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's hopes of eventually colonising Mars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three previous attempts have ended in the Starship's destruction, all part of what the company says is an acceptable cost in its rapid trial-and-error approach to development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fourth flight test turns our focus from achieving orbit to demonstrating the ability to return and reuse Starship and Super Heavy," SpaceX said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Super Heavy is the booster, while Starship refers to both the upper stage and the two stages combined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flight path will be similar to the third test, which took place in March and saw Starship fly halfway around the globe before it was eventually lost as it re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This time around, SpaceX hopes to achieve a soft splashdown for the booster stage in the Gulf of Mexico, and a "controlled entry" for the upper stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Designed to eventually be fully reusable, Starship stands 121 metres tall with both stages combined – 27 metres taller than the Statue of Liberty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Super Heavy booster produces 16.7 million pounds (74.3 Meganewtons) of thrust, almost double that of the world's second most powerful rocket, Nasa's Space Launch System – though the latter is now certified, while Starship is still a prototype.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX's strategy of carrying out tests in the real world rather than in labs has paid off in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its Falcon 9 rockets have come to be workhorses for Nasa and the commercial sector, its Dragon capsule sends astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, and its Starlink internet satellite constellation now covers dozens of countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the clock is ticking for SpaceX to be ready for Nasa's planned return of astronauts to the Moon in 2026, using a modified Starship as the lander vehicle. (AFP)

    Some 45,000 Rohingya have fled fighting in Myanmar: UN

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations warned on Friday that escalating fighting in conflict-torn Myanmar's Rakhine State had forced around 45,000 minority Rohingya to flee, amid allegations of killings and burnings of property.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced in recent days by the fighting in Buthidaung and Maungdaw townships," UN rights office spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell told reporters in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "An estimated 45,000 Rohingya have reportedly fled to an area on the Naf River near the border with Bangladesh, seeking protection," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clashes have rocked Rakhine since the Arakan Army (AA) attacked forces of the ruling junta in November, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since a military coup in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA says it is fighting for more autonomy for the ethnic Rakhine population in the state, which is also home to around 600,000 members of the persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Rakhine in 2017 during a crackdown by the military that is now the subject of a United Nations genocide court case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over a million Rohingya are already in Bangladesh, having fled past purges," Throssell pointed out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN rights chief Volker Turk was urging Bangladesh and other countries "to provide effective protection to those seeking it, in line with international law, and to ensure international solidarity with Bangladesh in hosting Rohingya refugees in Myanmar", she said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Judges at the top United Nations court ordered Israel on Friday to halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Reading out a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or World Court, the body's president Nawaf Salam said provisional measures ordered by the court in March did not fully address the situation in the besieged Palestinian enclave, and conditions had been met for a new emergency order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel must immediately halt its military offensive" in Rafah, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court backed a South African request to order Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a week after Pretoria called for the measure in a case accusing Israel of genocide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has repeatedly dismissed the case's accusations of genocide as baseless, arguing in court that its operations in Gaza are self-defence and targeted at Hamas militants who attacked Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli government spokesman said "no power on Earth would stop Israel from protecting its citizens and going after Hamas in Gaza".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel launched its assault on the southern city of Rafah this month, forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee a city that had become a refuge to around half of the population's 2.3 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the ruling by the ICJ is a blow to Israel's international standing, the court does not have a police force to enforce its orders. In another case on its docket, Russia has so far ignored a 2022 order by the court to halt its military campaign in Ukraine.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The presidents of Northwestern and Rutgers universities in the United States defended their decisions to end pro-Palestinian encampments through negotiations rather than police force, telling a US House committee on Thursday that they defused the danger without ceding ground to protesters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “We had to get the encampment down,” Northwestern's Michael Schill said. “The police solution was not going to be available to us to keep people safe, and also may not be the wisest solution as we’ve seen at other campuses across the country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schill and Jonathan Holloway of Rutgers were called before the House Education and the Workforce Committee as part of a series of hearings examining how colleges have responded to allegations of antisemitism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also testifying was Gene Block, chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles, which has come under scrutiny for a delayed police response to violence between pro-Palestinian protesters and counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee’s inquiry expanded to large, public universities, UCLA and Rutgers, after earlier hearings largely focused on private, Ivy League colleges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Philadelphia, protesters packed up their belongings and left a pro-Palestinian encampment at Drexel University after the school announced a decision to have police clear the encampment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  University President John Fry said in a statement that he decided to have campus police and public safety officers join Philadelphia police in clearing the encampment as peacefully as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News outlets reported that police gave protesters a warning to clear the encampment and the protesters left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, hundreds of students in graduation robes walked out of the Harvard University commencement chanting “Free, free Palestine” after weeks of protests on campus and a day after the school announced that 13 students who participated in a protest encampment would not be able to receive diplomas alongside their classmates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students chanted “Let them walk, let them walk” during Thursday’s commencement, referring to allowing those 13 students to get their diplomas along with fellow graduates. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese dog whose photo inspired a generation of oddball online jokes and the US$23-billion Dogecoin cryptocurrency died on Friday, her owner said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She quietly passed away as if asleep while I caressed her," Atsuko Sato wrote on her blog, thanking the fans of her shiba inu called Kabosu – the face of the "Doge" meme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Kabo-chan was the happiest dog in the world. And I was the happiest owner," Sato wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a rescue dog, Kabosu's real birthday was unknown but Sato estimated her age at 18, past the average lifespan for a shiba inu, with her birthday celebrated in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2010, two years after adopting Kabosu from a puppy mill where she would otherwise have been put down, Sato took a picture of her pet crossing her paws on the sofa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She posted that image – with the fluffy shiba inu giving the camera a beguiling look – on her blog, from where it spread to online forum Reddit and became a meme that bounced from college bedrooms to office e-mail chains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The memes typically used goofy broken English to reveal the inner thoughts of Kabosu and other shiba inu "doge" – pronounced like pizza "dough" but with a "j" at the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The picture also later became an NFT digital artwork that sold for US$4 million and inspired Dogecoin, which was started as a joke by two software engineers and is now the eighth-most valuable cryptocurrency with a market capitalisation of US$23 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian media reports on Friday said more than 100 people were believed to have been killed Friday in a landslide that buried a village in a remote part of Papua New Guinea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The landslide reportedly hit Kaokalam village in Enga province early on Friday morning, about 600 kilometres northwest of the South Pacific island nation's capital of Port Moresby, ABC reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Provincial governor Peter Ipatas told international media there had been a big landslide "causing loss of life and property" amid unconfirmed reports that hundreds may be buried.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He later said that "more than six villages" had been hit, describing the scene as an "unprecedented natural disaster" that had caused "substantial damages".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rapid response team of medics, military, police and UN agencies was dispatched to the area to assess the damage and help the injured. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that ripped through a small apartment block in central Hanoi has killed at least 14 people and injured three others, state media said Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The fire broke out at around 12.30am. The fire was big, with several explosions," the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By 6.20am, at least 14 people had died and three were injured, VNA cited local officials as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear how many people were in the flat at the time the fire broke out. The flames were extinguished after an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The building is situated down a two-metre-wide alley, with the top floors of the building rented out, VNA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first floor was reportedly used for the selling and fixing of electric bicycles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A neighbour, who declined to give her name, said she heard an "explosion like fire crackers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought there was a fight, or something hitting the window. I ran down and saw the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of the neighbours had run out of the alley, crossing through other neighbours' houses. We were so, so scared." (AFP)

    Iran's Raisi buried after dying in helicopter crash

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi was laid to rest on Thursday, concluding days of funeral rites attended by throngs of mourners after his death in a helicopter crash, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands marched in his home town Mashhad to bid farewell to Raisi ahead of his burial following processions in the cities of Tabriz, Qom, Tehran and Birjand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 63-year-old died on Sunday alongside his foreign minister and six others after their helicopter went down in the country's mountainous northwest while returning from a dam inauguration on the border with Azerbaijan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once the five days of public mourning, announced on Monday, have passed, the authorities including acting President Mohammad Mokhber will focus on organising an election for a new president set for June 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Men and women, who were mainly clad in black chadors and clutching white flowers, crowded the main boulevard of Mashhad, the Islamic republic's second city in the northeast where Raisi was born.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some held aloft placards paying tribute to Raisi as the "man of the battlefield" as a large truck carrying his body drove through the sea of mourners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have come, O king, give me refuge," said a slogan emblazoned on top of the truck, in reference to Imam Reza, the eighth imam of Shiite Islam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Posters of Raisi, black flags and Shi'ite symbols were erected along the streets of Mashhad, particularly around Raisi's final resting place – the Imam Reza shrine, a key mausoleum visited by millions of pilgrims every year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier thousands of people holding images of Raisi and waving flags lined the streets of Birjand, capital of the eastern province of South Khorasan, for the procession of Raisi's coffin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi was South Khorasan's representative in the Assembly of Experts, a clerical body in charge of selecting or dismissing Iran's supreme leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi had widely been expected to succeed supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who led prayers in Tehran on Wednesday for the late president and knelt before the coffins of the eight people killed in the helicopter crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them was foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who was buried on Thursday in the shrine of Shah Abdol-Azim in the town of Shahre Ray south of the capital. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The North Atlantic hurricane season, which starts on June 1, is forecast to be "extraordinary," with between four and seven hurricanes of Category 3 or higher expected, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather agency said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Category 3 storms pack wind speeds over 178 kilometres an hour and wreak devastating damage on houses, uproot trees and often cut off electricity and water for days or even weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This season is looking to be an extraordinary one in a number of ways," said Rick Spinrad of the NOAA, which cited warm Atlantic ocean temperatures and La Nina conditions in the Pacific for the expected increase in storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said human-caused climate change was warming oceans and melting ice on land, leading to sea level rises that worsen storm surges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The forecast for named storms – hurricanes and major hurricanes – is the highest NOAA has ever issued for the May outlook," Spinrad said. "It only takes one storm to devastate a community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oceanic heat in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea creates more energy to fuel storms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hurricane Ian, which struck Florida in September 2022, caused 152 deaths and losses worth US$112.9 billion. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The man charged with shooting and seriously wounding Slovakia's prime minister said he did so to oppose the government's Ukraine policy but regrets his actions, according to a court document.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Slovakia was left reeling last week after the head of government, Robert Fico, was struck by four bullets while greeting supporters in the central town of Handlova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was rushed to hospital and underwent two lengthy operations in nearby Banska Bystrica. The hospital on Thursday said that he remains in a "serious but stable" condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged gunman, identified by Slovak media as 71-year-old poet Juraj Cintula, has been charged with premeditated attempted murder and was remanded in custody at a hearing on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the interrogation, he stated that since he does not agree with the policy of the current government... he decided to act," pretrial judge Roman Puchovsky wrote in a decision on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accused notably said he disagreed with the government's decision to abolish the special prosecutor's office and to stop sending military aid to Ukraine, as well as alleged media persecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He repeated that he did not want to kill (name redacted) but wanted to wound him and impair his health, that he aimed at his lower torso," Puchovsky wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He realises that he acted completely impermissibly, that he should not have harmed the victim," the judge added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He sincerely regrets his actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attempted assassination has highlighted acute political divisions in Slovakia, where 59-year-old Fico took office in October after his Smer party won a general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now serving his fourth term as prime minister, Fico soured ties with Ukraine after he questioned the neighbouring country's sovereignty as it battles Russian forces. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A tornado that ripped through the midwestern US state of Iowa killed five people and left dozens injured, officials said, with homes smashed to pieces and cars thrown through the air.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Residents surveyed the wreckage of flattened buildings and uprooted trees after the storm left a path of destruction across the town of Greenfield on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Four fatalities and at least 35 injuries were the result of the tornado that impacted the Greenfield, Adair County area," the Iowa State Patrol said Wednesday, adding that the number of injured could still rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The local hospital was damaged and some patients were moved to other facilities, while airlift flights were also undertaken after the storm slammed the town of 2,000 residents 70 kilometres from state capital Des Moines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 100 emergency workers combed through the debris, said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, while local officials reported at least one other person was also killed in nearby Adams County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tornado reports in the United States have been far above average in recent weeks, according to CNN, with more than 800 tornadoes this year making it one of the most active on record. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's president made a long-haul trip to the restive Pacific territory of New Caledonia on Thursday, urging a "return to peace" after deadly rioting, and vowing thousands of military reinforcements will be deployed for "as long as necessary".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Emmanuel Macron arrived in the capital Noumea after a 24-hour flight seeking ways to end more than a week of looting, arson and clashes that have left six people dead and hundreds injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he exited the plane at Tontouta International Airport, the French leader told reporters he wanted to ensure that "as quickly as possible there will be a return to peace, calm, security".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is the absolute priority," Macron added, as he prepared to launch a day of intensive meetings with local leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later, he described the unrest as an "absolutely unprecedented insurrection movement".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No-one saw it coming with such a level of organisation and violence," he said while visiting a police station in the capital Noumea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Praising security forces for "professionalism" and "cool-headedness", he vowed Paris would "go until the end" to quell the worst violence to erupt in the territory in four decades, warning that "the coming days and weeks will still be difficult".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to spend about 12 hours on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France has ruled New Caledonia since the 1800s, but many Indigenous Kanaks still resent Paris' power over their islands and want fuller autonomy or independence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since May 13, separatists have cut off whole neighbourhoods and the main route to the international airport, which remains shuttered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nightly riots have seen scores of cars, schools, shops and businesses burned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities have imposed a state of emergency, placed separatist leaders under house arrest, banned alcohol sales and sent around 3,000 troops, police and other security reinforcements to quell the turmoil. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Nvidia easily beat Wall Street estimates as its profits and revenues skyrocketed, boosted by its chipmaking dominance which has made the company an icon of the artificial intelligence boom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its net income rose more than sevenfold compared to a year earlier, jumping to US$14.88 billion in its first quarter that ended April 28 from US$2.04 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue more than tripled, rising to US$26.04 billion from US$7.19 billion in the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The next industrial revolution has begun,” CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centre he called “AI factories” designed to produce “a new commodity — artificial intelligence.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huang added that training AI models was becoming a faster process as they learn to become “multimodal” — that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data — and also “to reason and plan.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company reported earnings per share — adjusted to exclude one-time items — of US$6.12, well above the US$5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares in Nvidia Corp rose 6 percent in after-hours trading to US$1,006.89.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s stock has risen more than 200 percent in the past year. (AP)

 Officials in Mexico said at least nine people were killed and 50 others injured when a stage collapsed at a campaign event for the Citizens' Movement Party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party's presidential candidate, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, said on social media that a gust of wind caused the stage to collapse at the event in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy enclave near the industrial hub of Monterrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alvarez said he was "ok" after being taken to a local hospital, but that members of his team were hurt. (Agencies)

    US says it opposes 'unilateral' Palestine recognition

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House said on Wednesday it opposed "unilateral recognition" of a Palestinian state after Ireland, Norway and Spain announced they would establish relations but warned Israel against withholding funds in retaliation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden "has been on the record supporting a two-state solution," his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has been equally emphatic on the record that that two-state solution should be brought about through direct negotiations through the parties, not through unilateral recognition," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stopped short of criticising the decision to formally recognise the State of Palestine by the three European countries, all close allies of the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Each country is entitled to make its own determinations, but the US position on this is clear," Sullivan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has responded angrily, including by withdrawing envoys, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accusing the European nations of offering a "reward for terror."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told Netanyahu that he wants to take retaliatory action including severing an arrangement in which Norway handles funds intended to the Palestinian Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under peace agreements brokered in part by Norway in the 1990s, Israel collects money for the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israel has blocked transfers since the aftermath of the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan said that funds should keep going to the Palestinian Authority which the Biden administration wants to strengthen in hopes it can assume control of Gaza from Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's wrong on a strategic basis, because withholding funds destabilises the West Bank," Sullivan said of Israeli moves to stop funds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It undermines the search for security and prosperity for the Palestinian people which is in Israel's interests, and, I think, it's wrong to withhold funds that provide basic goods and services to innocent people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been pushing Israel to move forward on a timeline for a Palestinian state, in part by dangling the prospect of Saudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Washington vetoed a recent UN Security Council bid to recognise the State of Palestine, saying that recognition could only come through negotiations that take into account Israel's security interests. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge in Tennessee on Wednesday temporarily halted a foreclosure sale of Graceland, the historic home of Elvis Presley in the southern US state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The auction of the property had been scheduled to take place on Thursday but was paused by Shelby County Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presley's granddaughter, actress Riley Keough, had filed a lawsuit seeking to block the sale of the sprawling estate in Memphis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A company called Naussany Investments & Private Lending was seeking to auction off Graceland, claiming that Keough's mother, Lisa Marie Presley, had put it up as collateral in 2018 for a US$3.8 million loan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis's only child, died in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Keough, 34, who starred in "Mad Max: Fury Road" and "The Girlfriend Experience," claimed in her lawsuit filed on May 15 that the loan documents were fraudulent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jenkins said he was halting the auction until a trial can be held to determine the authenticity of the documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The court will enjoin the sale as requested," the judge said at a live-streamed court hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The real estate is considered unique under Tennessee law and, being unique, the loss of the real estate would be considered irreparable harm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc welcomed the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the court has now made clear, there was no validity to the claims," it said in a statement. "There will be no foreclosure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Graceland will continue to operate as it has for the past 42 years, ensuring that Elvis fans from around the world can continue to have a best in class experience when visiting his iconic home." (AFP)

    British PM Rishi Sunak sets July 4 election date

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday set July 4 as the date for a national election that will determine who governs the UK, choosing a day of good economic news to urge voters to give his governing Conservatives another chance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speculation about an imminent election had mounted throughout the day after Sunak called a Cabinet meeting for Wednesday afternoon – rather than the usual Tuesday – and Foreign Secretary David Cameron flew back early from a trip to Albania to attend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak’s centre-right party has seen its support dwindle steadily after 14 years in power. It has struggled to overcome a series of crises including an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders in the past two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour Party is strongly favoured to defeat Sunak’s party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain must hold a national election by January 2025, and Sunak has repeatedly said it will be in the back end of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stuck to that line on Wednesday, answering a lawmaker’s question about whether there would be a summer vote: “Spoiler alert: There is going to be a general election in the second half of this year.” (AP)

    Three European nations to recognise Palestine as state

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several major European countries on Wednesday announced they would recognise Palestine as a state at the end of the month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Norway and Spain said they would formally recognise Palestine as a state from May 28 onwards while Ireland also made a similar pledge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel recalled its envoys from Ireland and Norway for "urgent consultations" in response to their decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the decision to recognise a Palestinian state undermined Israel's right to self-defence and efforts to return the 128 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Authority and its rival group Hamas both welcomed the recognition of a Palestinian state by the three countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most Western governments, including the United States, say they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement is reached on thorny issues like its final borders and the status of Jerusalem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez charged that his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign of "pain and destruction" in the Gaza Strip was now putting the two-state solution in danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said "recognition of Palestine is a means of supporting the moderate forces which have been losing ground in this protracted and brutal conflict".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike: Two states, living side by side, in peace and security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris called the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel "barbaric", but added that "a two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing will attend the memorial service of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Foreign Ministry, Zhang, as President Xi Jinping's special representative, will attend the service in the capital Tehran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, huge crowds of Iranians thronged the streets of Tehran on Wednesday for the funeral procession of Raisi and his entourage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the city centre, mourners clutching portraits of Raisi gathered in and around the University of Tehran, where Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led the prayers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flanked by top officials, Khamenei said prayers over the coffins of the dead, who also included Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi's helicopter crashed into a fog-shrouded mountainside in northwestern Iran on Sunday as he headed back to the city of Tabriz after attending a ceremony on the border with Azerbaijan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A huge search and rescue operation was launched, involving help from Turkey, Russia and the European Union. Iranian state television announced Raisi's death early on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raisi, who was widely expected to succeed Khamenei as supreme leader, was 63.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the capital, huge banners have gone up hailing the late president as "the martyr of service", while others bade "farewell to the servant of the disadvantaged".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tehran residents received phone messages urging them to "attend the funeral of the martyr of service".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the university, the coffins will be driven to the huge Enghelab Square in the city centre and on to Azadi Square, state media said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Funeral rites for Raisi and his entourage began on Tuesday with processions through Tabriz and the Shiite clerical centre of Qom drawing tens of thousands of black-clad mourners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Tehran, the bodies will be taken to Iran's second city of Mashhad, Raisi's hometown in the northeast, where he will be buried on Thursday evening after funeral rites at the Imam Reza shrine. (AFP and agencies)

 Renowned Sherpa mountain guide Kami Rita scaled Mount Everest for a record 30th time on Wednesday, completing his second climb this month to the top of the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rita reached the 8,849-metre summit at 7:49am local time, according to Khim Lal Gautam, a Nepalese government official at Everest base camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first ascent of this year's climbing season was on May 12 guiding foreign clients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also climbed Mount Everest twice last year, setting the record for the most climbs of the world's highest mountain on the first and extending it less than a week later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His closest competitor for the most climbs of Mount Everest is fellow Sherpa guide Pasang Dawa, who has 27 successful ascents of the mountain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rita first climbed Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success each year of foreign climbers who seek to stand on top of the mountain. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsonists torched schools and hundreds of cars overnight in New Caledonia, officials said on Wednesday, as French President Emmanuel Macron embarked on a surprise visit aiming to end nine days of deadly riots on the French Pacific archipelago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Macron left Paris on Tuesday on a flight to the troubled territory, a popular holiday destination where roads are now littered with charred vehicles, and scores of shops, schools and other buildings are in cinders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clashes have left six people dead and hundreds injured since unrest erupted on May 13 on the Pacific islands, home to 270,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities said the violence had eased since 1,050 troops, tactical police and national security reinforcements from Paris were deployed, including to "highly sensitive" areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, two primary schools and 300 cars in a dealership were torched in the territory's capital Noumea during the night, the mayor's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deadliest unrest in four decades has been blamed on French plans to give voting rights to thousands of non-indigenous residents, which Indigenous Kanaks say will dilute their votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An official close to the president said Macron aims to "listen to, talk and hold discussions with New Caledonian elected officials" in an attempt to restore order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He wants to "give answers to the many legitimate questions Caledonians are asking, both on the reconstruction side and the political side", the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But one Kanak manning an unofficial roadblock north of the capital Noumea said Macron needed to understand Indigenous opposition to the vote reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know why our fate is being discussed by people who don't even live here," said the 52-year-old, who gave only his first name Mike. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari added that Iran attaches great importance to its relationship with China, and is committed to enhancing cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British police are investigating the unexplained death of a man, who was charged earlier this month for allegedly helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the United Kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Matthew Trickett was due to appear in court on Friday to face charges under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British police said Trickett, who was 37, was found dead in a park in Maidenhead, west of London, on Sunday afternoon after a report from a member of the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said an investigation was ongoing into the death and an autopsy would be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett’s lawyer said he was "shocked" by the news and was supporting Trickett's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect was a former Royal Marine who'd worked for the UK border force. He was also the director of a security consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In early May, Trickett was arrested along with Peter Wai and Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Trade Office in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three men were granted bail and were due to appear in court on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When they were charged, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said it made serious representations to UK officials over the matter, saying it firmly rejected and strongly condemned "Britain's fabrication of the so-called case".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR Government, meanwhile, said it had "demanded the UK Government provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter. (Agencies)

    WHO says north Gaza hospitals barely operational

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians evacuate Kamal Adwan hospital following an Israeli strike. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754129_1_20240522034215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Gaza's last two functioning hospitals, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan, are barely operational, doctors and the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday with the Israel-Hamas war now in its eighth month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hospital officials said Israeli forces had fired on the facilities and that snipers had been deployed near one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today marks the third day of the siege on Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza," said the hospital's acting director Dr Mohammad Saleh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He reported that Israeli forces had been "firing at the hospital buildings" and that "snipers" have taken up position in nearby houses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Saleh said the "southern wall" of the hospital "has been destroyed" and "all medical staff and patients" are inside the hospital wards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moving around the hospital was "extremely difficult," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But staff still had to transfer water "from the second building to the first one because the occupation (Israeli) forces hit the first building with a shell on the fifth floor yesterday (Monday), destroying the water tanks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva that "148 hospital staff, 22 patients and their companions are trapped inside" the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO regularly visited Al-Awda in April to deliver medical supplies and fuel, but Ghebreyesus also reported snipers aiming at the building and artillery hitting the fifth floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dounia Dekhili, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Gaza, said "nothing is coming in or out" of the hospital because of fears of sniper fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our operating theatre supervisor has been hiding for a few days, he can hear gunshots," Dekhili said after speaking to the man inside Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Saleh did not report any casualties, but said the episode was reminiscent of the last Israeli military operation in the area of the northern Gaza hospital, which is located next to the Jabalia refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Israeli forces besieged Al-Awda for days, killing two staff and detaining others, MSF reported at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has yet to comment on the operation in Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday also saw patients and staff being evacuated from another north Gaza hospital, Kamal Adwan, said its director Dr Hossam Abu Safia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, the hospital is being evacuated of the wounded, patients, and medical staff," he said, adding that "there are several patients that the medical teams have not been able to evacuate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "the reception and emergency entrance gate of Kamal Adwan Hospital was targeted by an artillery shell from the Israeli army," as soldiers advanced towards the complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the Palestinian Territories, said on Tuesday from Jerusalem that the hospital's intensive care unit reception area had been hit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the moment, 20 health staff and 13 patients remain," Peeperkorn said, adding that "these are ... functional hospitals we cannot afford to lose," referring to both Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the only two functional hospitals remaining in northern Gaza. Ensuring their ability to deliver health services is imperative," Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli troops have previously raided other medical facilities in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, the territory's largest hospital, now reduced to rubble after a March operation, the WHO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military accuses Hamas of using hospitals as command centres to plan and launch attacks against its forces, a charge the militant group denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza Strip has been gripped by war since Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,647 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's defence lawyers rested their case on Tuesday – without the former president following through on a vow to testify – as the judge planned jury deliberations in the historic criminal trial for early next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After approximately five weeks, 19 witnesses, reams of documents and sometimes salacious testimony, judgment day in the first ever trial of a former US president was drawing closer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York law means the trial has not been shown on television and experts are divided on whether the airing of Trump's dirty laundry is having much of a political impact. However, with a clash against President Joe Biden less than six months away, the looming jury verdict represents a moment of acute peril for the Republican.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Juan Merchan told jurors that closing arguments would take place next Tuesday when each side would make their pitch to the 12 New Yorkers who will ultimately decide Trump's fate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will expect you will begin your deliberations hopefully at some point on Wednesday," Merchan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's lawyers have sought to undermine key testimony against the former president, who is accused of illegally covering up hush money paid to a porn star over an alleged encounter that could have derailed his successful 2016 White House bid against Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Robert Costello was grilled on emails he sent to prosecution star witness Michael Cohen after the FBI raided him in 2018, with Trump's lawyers seeking to undermine Cohen and the prosecution case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Costello sparred with Merchan on Monday, prompting the magistrate to rebuke him for poor courtroom etiquette. Trump, in one of his regular tirades outside the courtroom, accused Merchan of being a "tyrant" in what he claimed was a "show trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Monday, both sides asked their final questions of Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and ultra-loyal fixer who eventually turned on his boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's lawyers set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lawyer Todd Blanche also probed Cohen's loyalty to Trump and then to the prosecution, looking to show jurors that Cohen is self-serving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche vied to goad Cohen, who has a reputation for a short temper that could have hurt him on the stand – but the witness largely maintained his composure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen's story generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Blanche finished with him, the prosecution returned for redirect, with prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asking Cohen what the whole experience has meant for him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire life has been turned upside down," Cohen said, emotion in his voice. "I lost my law licence, my financial security..., my family's happiness... just to name a few."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout the trial, which has upended the political and legal order, Trump has complained his 2024 election campaign for another White House term is being stymied by the weeks-long court proceedings, which he has to attend every day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did so again on Monday, complaining to journalists he's "not allowed to have anything to do with politics because I'm sitting in a very freezing cold, dark room for the last four weeks. It's very unfair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling the case politicised, a coterie of leading Republicans have stood in the wings behind him as he gives remarks to reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The growing list includes several lawmakers eyeing Trump's vice presidential pick, including Ohio Senator JD Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet despite the palace intrigue and courtroom drama, the charges ultimately hinge on financial records, and whether falsifying them was done with intent to sway the 2016 presidential vote. (AFP)

    UK blood scandal victims to receive payouts this year

    <![CDATA[<img alt="British government minister John Glen said victims would receive interim payments of £210,000 (US$267,000) within 90 days.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Victims of a decades-long contaminated blood scandal that has killed about 3,000 people in Britain will start receiving final compensation payments this year, the government announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 30,000 people, including children, were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood between the 1970s and early 1990s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims are still dying from what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It follows similar scandals including the wrongful prosecution for fraud of hundreds of UK Post Office workers because of faulty software, and the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which falsely blamed football fans for the tragedy that killed 97.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bombshell report released on Monday found the tainted blood affair was covered up by successive governments and health officials, and largely could have been avoided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issued a "wholehearted and unequivocal" apology and promised compensation for everyone affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Updating parliament on those plans on Tuesday, government minister John Glen said victims would receive interim payments of £210,000 (US$267,000) within 90 days, before the final scheme becomes operational.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our expectation is that final payments will start before the end of the year," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Glen said there was "no restriction" on the total cost of the package, which according to media reports could total more than £10 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friends, family members and carers of those infected will also be eligible for compensation, he announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compensation will be paid to the estate of any person who has died from the scandal and money will be distributed either in a lump sum or via regular payments, Glen added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Brian Langstaff's report, running to more than 2,500 pages, found a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It concluded that blood donors were not screened properly, the risk of AIDS was downplayed and too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak's official spokesman told reporters on Tuesday: "We must fundamentally rebalance the system so that we finally address this pattern so familiar from other inquiries like Hillsborough where innocent victims have to fight for decades just to be believed and heard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work together across government, our health services and civil society to ensure that nothing like this can ever happen in our country again." (AFP)

 One passenger was killed and 30 injured after a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence en route on Tuesday, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Bangkok, officials and the airline said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We deeply apologise for the traumatic experience that our passengers and crew members suffered on this flight," the airline said, adding it was working with Thai authorities to provide all necessary assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One male passenger died, Kittipong Kittikachorn, Director of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, said. Eighteen people have been hospitalised and 12 are being treated in hospitals, Singapore Airlines said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately possible to reconstruct the incident from publicly available tracking data, but a spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said it was analysing data at around 3:49 pm Hong Kong time, which shows the plane tilting upwards and return to its cruising altitude over the space of a minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger who was on the flight said that the incident involved the sensation of rising then falling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Suddenly the aircraft starts tilting up and there was shaking so I started bracing for what was happening, and very suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling," Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student on board the flight said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said with regard to data showing a drop in height, "our initial thinking is the turbulence event is prior to the standard descent from 37,000 to 31,000 feet. That appears to just be a flight level change in preparation for landing".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Boeing 777-300ER plane with 211 passengers and 18 crew was headed to Singapore when it made the emergency landing, the airline said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore news outlet CNA carried blurry pictures supplied by readers that it said appeared to be from the flight. They showed anxious passengers clinging to seats, with oxygen masks hanging from above, personal items strewn across the aisle and rubbish spilled on the floor of the cabin crew area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Suvarnabhumi airport said the plane requested an emergency landing at 4:35 pm Hong Kong time and landed at 4:51 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognised as one of the world's leading airlines and is a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore Airlines has had seven accidents according to records by the Aviation Safety Network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said on Monday that the bodies of four hostages retrieved from Gaza last week were found in tunnels under Jabalia, where troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in recent days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The army said last week it had recovered the bodies of Ron Benjamin, Yitzhak Gelerenter, Shani Louk, and Amit Buskila, all of whom it said had been killed in Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their remains were recovered "from underground tunnels in Jabalia in northern Gaza," the army said late on Monday in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a military operation, Israeli soldiers searched a suspected building in which a tunnel shaft was located, the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Soldiers then entered the underground tunnel route in a night operation and inside it conducted combat," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the fighting the soldiers "located the bodies of the hostages and rescued them from the tunnels," the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four were taken hostage during the attack on the Nova music festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of young people had gathered on October 6 and 7 to dance to electronic music at the event held near Re'im kibbutz close to the Gaza border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fighters from Hamas crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 360 people at the festival, Israeli officials have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nova festival victims accounted for nearly a third of the more than 1,170 people killed in the October 7 attack, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of the 252 people taken hostage that day, 124 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 35,562 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since early May the Israeli military has been engaged in renewed street battles in northern and central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the army said that the fighting in the northern town of Jabalia was "perhaps the fiercest" in over seven months of war. (AFP)

    UK PM 'sorry' for cover-up over infected blood scandal
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The tainted blood scandal has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753958_1_20240521024738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday apologised to thousands of people infected with contaminated blood in a decades-long scandal that a damning report concluded was covered up and largely could have been avoided.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 30,000 people were infected with viruses such as HIV and hepatitis after being given the tainted blood in Britain between the 1970s and early 1990s, the Infected Blood Inquiry concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victims included those needing blood transfusions for accidents and in surgery, and those suffering from blood disorders such as haemophilia who were treated with donated blood plasma products, as well as the partners of those infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 3,000 people died, and more will follow, in what has been described as the biggest treatment disaster in the eight-decade history of the state-run National Health Service (NHS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am truly sorry," Sunak told the House of Commons, calling the findings of the long-awaited report "a day of shame for the British state."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Time and again people in positions of power and trust had the chance to stop the transmission of those infections and failed to do so," he added, promising "whatever it costs" to compensate victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total figure is expected to be above £10 billion (US$12 billion) when the government announces the package on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, running to more than 2,500 pages, laid bare a "catalogue of failures" with "catastrophic" consequences for victims and their loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, children with bleeding disorders were treated as "objects for research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one school where 122 pupils with haemophilia were given infected blood products between 1970 and 1987, only 30 now survive, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to report that it could largely, though not entirely, have been avoided," concluded its author, judge Brian Langstaff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His team found that successive governments and health professionals failed to mitigate risks despite it being apparent by the early 1980s that the cause of AIDS could be transmitted by blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blood donors were not screened properly and blood products were imported from abroad, including from the United States where drug users and prisoners were used for donations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Too many transfusions were also given when they were not necessarily needed, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were even attempts to conceal the scandal, including evidence that officials in the health department destroyed documents in 1993.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Viewing the response of the NHS and of government overall, the answer to the question, 'Was there a cover-up?' is that there has been," the report stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not in the sense of a handful of people plotting in an orchestrated conspiracy to mislead, but in a way that was more subtle, more pervasive and more chilling in its implications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this way there has been a hiding of much of the truth," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of the 3,000 patients who died, many more were left with lifelong health problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Langstaff said that "the scale of what happened is horrifying" and said people's suffering had been compounded by repeated denials and false assurances that they had received good treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When victims were told the truth, sometimes years later, this was sometimes done in "insensitive" and "inappropriate" ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I have found is that disaster was no accident. People put their trust in doctors and the government to keep them safe and that trust was betrayed," Langstaff told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Theresa May launched the inquiry – one of the country's largest – in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campaigners hailed the report as the culmination of a decades-long struggle but noted that it came too late for many of the victims who will never see justice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andy Evans, chairman of the Tainted Blood campaign group, described the report as "momentous" and that he felt "validated and vindicated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been gaslit for generations... Sometimes we felt like we were shouting into the wind during the last 40 years," he told reporters. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen has stayed largely composed and on topic during cross-examination. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753952_1_20240521003251.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's trial on charges of covering up hush money payments to a porn star approached its final stages on Monday, with closing arguments expected early next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Due to an upcoming holiday weekend as well as legal squabbles over jury instructions among other yet undisclosed "issues," Judge Juan Merchan told the court "it's become apparent that we are not going to be able to sum up tomorrow" as he had hoped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's still unclear if the defence will present a case – they are not required to – or whether Trump himself will testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most experts say it is highly unlikely he will take the stand in his watershed criminal trial, the first ever of a former US president, as it would expose him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination by prosecutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche has raised the prospect his client could step up as a witness, telling the judge last week "that's another decision we need to consider."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the prosecution can rest, defence lawyers will first conclude grilling the state's star witness, Michael Cohen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer turned tormentor, recounted last week how he kept Trump informed about US$130,000 paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over several days of questioning that continued on Monday, Trump's lawyers have set out to paint Cohen as a convicted criminal and habitual liar, recalling his time in prison for tax fraud and lying to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche has also probed Cohen's loyalty both past and present, to Trump and the prosecution respectively, looking to show jurors that the former fixer is self-serving and willing to go to great lengths to accomplish his aims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen has said repeatedly he takes "responsibility" for his actions and has faced the consequences. Prior to the trial, including in his books, he had done little to hide his contempt for his former boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blanche has striven to ruffle Cohen, who has a reputation for a temper that could hurt him on the stand – but the witness has stayed largely composed and on topic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen's story has generally lined up with Daniels and David Pecker, the tabloid boss who said he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress negative coverage during the Republican's 2016 White House run. (AFP)

    WikiLeaks founder Assange stalls extradition to US

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Monday won a legal bid to appeal against his extradition from Britain to the United States on espionage charges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  High Court judges Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson said Assange had grounds to challenge the UK government’s extradition order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange faces 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over his website’s publication of a trove of classified US documents almost 15 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian has spent the last five years in a British high-security prison after taking refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyers for Assange argued Monday the US provided “blatantly inadequate” assurances the WikiLeaks founder would have free press protections if extradited to America to face espionage charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said prosecutors had failed to guarantee that Assange, who is an Australian citizen and claims protections as a journalist for publishing US classified information, could rely on press protections of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. (AP)
