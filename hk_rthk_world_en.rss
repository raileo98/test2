<div class="itemFullText">
 World Triathlon on Tuesday said the Paris Olympics men's triathlon event will be postponed by a day, after tests showed the water quality in the River Seine was not up to standard.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The development means Hong Kong's Jason Ng is now scheduled to compete on Wednesday at 4.45pm. He was originally going to race at 2pm on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tests carried out in the Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held," World Triathlon said in a statement, adding the International Olympic Committee, Meteo France and Paris officials were involved in conducting the water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, meteorological events beyond our control, such as the rain which fell over Paris on 26 and 27 July, can alter water quality and compel us to reschedule the event for health reasons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's triathlon event will also take place on Wednesday, with World Triathlon saying both events are subject to future water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Paris based hydrologist had earlier told RTHK that rainstorms in the 24 hours before a swimming event in the Seine could wash storm water off the land surfaces around the city, bringing pollution with it.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British TV news presenter Huw Edwards, a household name in Britain, has been charged with three counts of making indecent pictures of children, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edwards, 62, was the BBC's highest paid news presenter and anchored the broadcaster's "BBC News at Ten" bulletin for more than two decades. He resigned in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been charged with three counts of making an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child relating to images found on a child's phone, according to court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat," a London police spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Edwards was arrested on 8 November, 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was bailed to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards was one of the main faces at the BBC until his departure, announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation, and leading coverage of the biggest events in Britain since the turn of the century, including elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He quit on medical advice after allegations emerged that he had paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos. (Reuters)

    Irish writer Edna O'Brien dead at 93

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"The Country Girls" (1960), about the sexual initiation of rebellious Catholic girls, is now a marker in modern Irish literature for its breaking of social and sexual taboos.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edna O'Brien, the radical Irish writer whose groundbreaking first novel "The Country Girls" was burned and banned in her native country, has died, her publisher announced on Sunday. She was 93.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She died peacefully on Saturday 27 July after a long illness," said a statement from publishers Faber Books posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faber called her "one of the greatest writers of our age."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish President Michael D Higgins said he had learned of the death of his "dear friend" O'Brien with "great sorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was "one of the outstanding writers of modern times" and "a fearless teller of truths," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "While the beauty of her work was immediately recognised abroad, it is important to remember the hostile reaction it provoked among those who wished for the lived experience of women to remain far from the world of Irish literature, with her books shamefully banned upon their early publication."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The honours she eventually received from her native Ireland included the Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Country Girls" (1960), about the sexual initiation of rebellious Catholic girls, drawn from O'Brien's childhood experiences, is now a marker in modern Irish literature for its breaking of social and sexual taboos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Brien was born in 1930 into a strict Catholic farming family in west Ireland's County Clare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was educated at a convent school and then in Dublin where she graduated with a pharmacist's licence in 1950, around the time she was discovering a passion for Leo Tolstoy, F Scott Fitzgerald and TS Eliot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2018, she won the prestigious PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, honoured for having broken down "social and sexual barriers for women in Ireland and beyond."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2021, France made her a Commander in the "Ordre des Arts et des Lettres," the nation's highest cultural distinction. (AFP)

    Canada teams subdue Jasper fire but not nearby blazes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two melted chairs are all that remain of this lodge in the town of Jasper. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763605_1_20240729044616.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The wildfires that destroyed nearly a third of the beloved tourist town of Jasper in western Canada are now under control, but firefighters are still battling other nearby blazes that could go on for months, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fires, touched off on Monday by lightning strikes in a drought-stricken area, are the biggest to hit the vast Jasper National Park in a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 30 percent of the structures in the town of Jasper – a popular tourist destination considered a scenic "jewel" of the Canadian Rockies – have been destroyed, though no deaths have been reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are anticipating that all remaining fires within the townsite will be extinguished today," Parks Canada, the government agency that manages the country's national parks, said on Sunday on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 25,000 residents and tourists were evacuated from Jasper beginning late on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parks Canada said teams working in Jasper on Sunday were continuing to secure the town's perimeter to prevent new outbreaks and protect critical infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters – their numbers bolstered by some 400 colleagues from New Zealand, Mexico and South Africa – were using a helicopter to spot and extinguish any flare-ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the town and the national park remain under evacuation orders. Royal Canadian Mounted Police are patrolling the area, limiting access to "incident staff and critical contractors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town will be reopened only "when the risk of wildfire activity is significantly reduced," Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Landon Shepherd, an agency official, said bringing the fire under control throughout the national park would "not be easy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) of forestland have gone up in smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout Alberta, 135 wildfires remained active on Sunday, about a quarter of them deemed out of control, Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 185 miles (300 kilometres) to the south of Jasper, in British Columbia province, residents of Slocan, a village of some 600 houses, have also had to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As in the United States, Canada's western region has been hard-hit by wildfires this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Repeated heat waves and dry conditions, both likely linked to global climate change, are believed to be key factors, scientists say. (AFP)

    Hezbollah evacuates positions ahead of expected attack

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israel frequently hits suspected Hezbollah positions along the southern Lebanese border. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763594_1_20240729014646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah has evacuated positions in south and east Lebanon after Israeli threats of reprisals for a deadly strike on the annexed Golan Heights, a source close to the group said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to "hit the enemy hard" a day after rocket fire from Lebanon killed 12 young people in Majdal Shams, again raising fears that the war in Gaza will spread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah movement for firing a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket but the Iran-backed group – which has regularly targeted Israeli military positions – said it had "no connection" to the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah has evacuated some positions in the south and in the Bekaa valley that it thinks could be a target for Israel," the source close to the group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has a strong presence in east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, which borders Syria, and in south Lebanon, from where it has been launching near daily attacks on Israeli positions since October in support of ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cross-border exchanges of fire have largely been limited to the border area, but Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside Lebanon, including overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah is also deployed in Syria, where for years it has been fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said pro-Iran groups and Hezbollah-affiliated fighters have "evacuated their positions" south of the capital and in the Damascus countryside, as well as in parts of the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights, in anticipation of "potential Israeli airstrikes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah had already abandoned positions in Syria in early June after Israeli raids, according to the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters, including from Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raids also seek to cut off Hezbollah supply routes to Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's raids on Syria intensified after Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip, then eased after an April 1 strike blamed on Israel hit the Iranian consular building in Damascus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That strike prompted Iran to launch a first-ever direct missile and drone attack against Israel on April 13-14, sending regional tensions skyrocketing. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans booed a Dutch beach volleyball player convicted of raping an underage girl as he played his first match at the Paris Olympics, where his controversial selection has put the sport in the spotlight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven van de Velde, now 29, was convicted in 2016 of raping an underage girl and sentenced to four years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He walked onto centre court Sunday with teammate Matthew Immers on Sunday morning to cheers and applause, with many orange-clad Dutch fans standing to clap the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he was introduced individually over the loudspeaker, however, there was a loud chorus of boos from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also sporadic boos as he served throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player has won the backing of his country's national Olympic committee, and exchanged a warm hug with teammate Immers before the start of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his selection has drawn outrage among women's and sports safety groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the player would be separated from his teammates, not stay in the athletes' village, and forbidden from speaking to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His teammate Immers told reporters after the match that they had been "disappointed" by all the focus on van de Velde's past conviction, particularly after a "hard fight" to qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know the guy for two, three years together and we played every tournament," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me that's a big example that you grew, you learned a lot from it. What happened in the past... it's not good of course. But right now we are trying to enjoy and go to the next round," Immers added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ju'Riese Colon, chief executive of the US-based Center for SafeSport, said she was "deeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate" in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With teams from around the world convening in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety," she said. (AFP)

    Tense Venezuela votes in shadow of 'bloodbath' warning

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Incumbent Nicolas Maduro has warned of a "bloodbath" if he loses. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763576_1_20240728223317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelans voted on Sunday between continuity in President Nicolas Maduro or change in rival Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia amid high tension following the incumbent's threat of a "bloodbath" if he loses, which polls suggest is likely.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With several international observers blocked from entering the South American country at the last minute, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for all parties to "respect the democratic process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Venezuelan people deserve an election that genuinely reflects their will, free from any manipulation. The international community is going to be watching this very closely," Blinken told reporters in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long queues of voters formed at several voting stations hours before polls opened at 6:00 am (1000 GMT). Polls close at 6:00 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have been here since 4:30 in the morning, and I hope it will be a successful day," lawyer Griselda Barroso, 54, said in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope there is democracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro, 61, is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is seeking a third six-year term at the helm of the once wealthy petro-state that saw GDP drop 80 percent in a decade, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a message published on social media overnight, Maduro urged Venezuelans to "Vote, vote, vote, and peace will triumph."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia, a 74-year-old former diplomat, called on his compatriots to turn out in large numbers "to transform your future" in what "will undoubtedly be the most important democratic expression of the people in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope and wish that everything will transpire in peace," he said in a video posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro lags far behind Gonzalez Urrutia in voter intention, according to independent polls, but counts on a loyal electoral machinery, military leadership and state institutions in a system of well-established political patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relying on its own figures, the government is also said to be certain of victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls suggest Sunday's vote poses the biggest threat yet to 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Maduro's predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chavez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts say the president is unlikely to concede defeat, especially in the absence of immunity guarantees, with his government under investigation for human rights abuses by the International Criminal Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Days before the vote, Maduro said the outcome would decide whether Venezuela enters a period of "peace or war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they do not want Venezuela to become a bloodbath, a fratricidal civil war produced by the fascists, let us guarantee the greatest success, the greatest electoral victory of our people," he said at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments drew condemnation from leaders including Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said: "Maduro has to learn: if you win, you stay. If you lose, you go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns were further stoked when Caracas blocked several international observers, including four ex-presidents who had their plane held up in Panama on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, a Venezuelan NGO said the government was holding 305 "political prisoners" and had arrested 135 people with links to the opposition campaign since January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caracas accuses the opposition of conspiring against Maduro, whose 2018 reelection was rejected as illegitimate by most Western and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Years of tough US sanctions failed to dislodge the president, who enjoys support from Cuba, Russia and China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has repeatedly vowed that he won't cede power now even as Venezuelans clamour for change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government blames sanctions, but observers point the finger at corruption and mismanagement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 21 million Venezuelans are registered to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has deployed tens of thousands of security forces and enforced ramped-up border control and a prohibition on public gatherings and protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the election in Venezuela will hardly be free or fair, Venezuelans have their best chance in over a decade to elect their government," Human Rights Watch Americas director Juanita Goebertus said this week, urging the international community to "have their (voters') back." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's national rail operator on Saturday said train travel was gradually returning to normal after multiple sabotage acts paralysed the network hours ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It remains unclear who carried out the three attacks overnight Thursday to Friday on rail infrastructure and if they were deliberately timed to disrupt the Olympics opening ceremony that took place later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a message of support for the sabotage was sent to several media outlets on Saturday, which also criticised the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of rail passengers struggled through a second day of cancelled and delayed trains on Saturday with 160,000 of the 800,000 people due to travel on a major holiday getaway weekend still facing cancellations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said national rail operator SNCF had mobilised a hundred workers overnight to repair the damage "in difficult weather conditions" and ensure a return to normal for Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the night, "with floodlights, in the rain, they patched up the wires one by one," said SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything will be repaired by Monday morning" on the SNCF network, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fibre optic cables running near the tracks and ensuring the transmission of safety information for drivers, such as signalling lights and points, were cut and set on fire during the night from Thursday to Friday on three of the main TGV lines, in the west, north and east of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No claim of responsibility has been made for the meticulously planned night-time attacks. Maintenance workers thwarted a fourth attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a statement sent to several news media expressed support for the sabotage and criticised the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They call it a festival? We see it as a celebration of nationalism, a gigantic stating of the subjugation of populations by states," said the email received by the newspaper La Provence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the headline of the message said, "claim to sabotage," no details of the action were provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was signed by "an unexpected delegation" and was sent via the online platform Riseup, whose users include those advocating for social change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris prosecutors on Friday opened a probe into an attack on "fundamental national interests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observers have noted that the nature of the attacks indicate the culprits would have needed deep knowledge of the functioning of the railways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the investigation was progressing, as he also expressed "relief" that the opening ceremony had taken place without any mishap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have uncovered a certain number of elements that allow us to think that we will soon know who is responsible for what clearly did not sabotage the Olympic Games but did sabotage part of the holidays of the French people," Darmanin told France 2 television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was "too early" to say who was behind the attack. "It could have come from inside (France) or from the outside."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities are on high alert for a terrorist attack during the Games, which run through August 11. Tens of thousands of police and troops are on security duties during the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 250,000 people missed their train on Friday, according to SNCF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three out of every 10 trains were cancelled on Saturday in the three regions affected by the attacks, with most trains still operating delayed by between one and two hours, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly one third of trains were cancelled in northern, western and eastern France. About a quarter of Eurostar high speed trains between Paris and London and Paris and Brussels were also called off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With normal services set to be fully restored on Monday, the situation is already expected to improve markedly on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine out of 10 TGV high speed trains will be able to run on the western and southwestern lines on Sunday, while service will be more patchy in the north, where seven out of 10 trains are due to run, SNCF said. Trains to eastern France have not been affected. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA deducted six points from Canada in the Paris Olympics women’s football tournament and banned three coaches for one year each on Saturday in a drone spying scandal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The stunning swath of punishments include a US$226,000 fine for the Canadian soccer federation in a case that has spiraled at the Summer Games. Two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand’s practices before their opening game last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Bev Priestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, already was suspended by the national soccer federation then removed from the Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priestman and her two assistants implicated in the case, Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander, are now banned from all soccer for one year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA fast-tracked its own disciplinary process by asking its appeals judges to handle the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA judges found Priestman and her two assistants “were each found responsible for offensive behavior and violation of the principles of fair play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Canadian federation was held responsible for not ensuring its staff complied with tournament rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coaches and the Canadian federation now can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport's special Olympic court in Paris. That tribunal is set up for urgent hearings and verdicts at the Olympics. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 11 people were killed in a rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, Israeli Channel 13 reported, amid an escalation of fire between Israel and armed groups in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli emergency service said earlier that 11 people were critically wounded by a rocket fired from Lebanon that hit a village football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams. A medic described great destruction and fire at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However senior Hezbollah media representative Mohammad Afif denied responsibility for the strike on Majdal Shams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire since October, after Hamas' attack on southern Israel triggered the Gaza war, in their worst escalation since 2006. (Reuters)

    Japan's Sado mines added to World Heritage list

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People celebrate after the Sado Island Gold Mine was registered as a World Heritage Site. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763465_1_20240728004100.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register on Saturday after South Korea dropped earlier objections to its listing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sado gold and silver mines, now a popular tourist attraction, are believed to have started operating as early as the 12th century and produced until after World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan had put a case for World Heritage listing because of their lengthy history and the artisanal mining techniques used there at a time when European mines had turned to mechanisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal was opposed by Seoul when it was first put because of the use of involuntary Korean labour during World War II, when Japan occupied the Korean peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But South Korea's foreign ministry said it had agreed to the listing "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unesco confirmed the listing at its ongoing committee meeting in New Delhi after a bid highlighting the archaeological preservation of "mining activities and social and labour organisation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The inscription was the result of a 14-year effort," Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to share this joy with local people as well as all Japanese citizens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan had reiterated a pledge to keeping the memories alive of "the harsh labour conditions of all workers," the foreign ministry in Tokyo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that exhibits on Sado island included data showing a higher percentage of Korean labourers were engaged in dangerous underground tasks, while others fled or were detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historians have argued that recruitment conditions at the mine effectively amounted to forced labour, and that Korean workers faced significantly harsher conditions than their Japanese counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discrimination did exist," Toyomi Asano, a professor of history of Japanese politics at Tokyo's Waseda University, said in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their working conditions were very bad and dangerous. The most dangerous jobs were allocated to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sado mines were listed alongside the Beijing Central Axis, a collection of former imperial palaces and gardens in the Chinese capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 589-hectare heritage area reflects "the ancient Chinese tradition of urban planning, serving as an important emblem that highlights the distinctive characteristics of Chinese civilisation," state news agency Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other listings this week include the centuries-old, ornate burial mounds of the Ahom Dynasty in northeastern India and the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saint Hilarion complex, one of the oldest monasteries in the Middle East dating back to the fourth century, was meanwhile added to a list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Unesco committee meeting runs until Wednesday. (AFP)

    Israeli strike on Gaza school kills 30

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said an Israeli strike on Saturday on a school killed 30 people, after a days-long military operation further south left around 170 dead, according to the civil defence agency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Since July 6 at least eight schools – including the latest one – have been hit leaving more than 100 people dead, based on a tally of tolls given by the health ministry and a hospital source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced at least once during the war started by the October 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings including the one hit on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest strike in the Deir el-Balah city area targeted Khadija school, the health ministry said. More than 100 people were wounded, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it carried out a strike on the school targeting "terrorists" operating there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further south, in the Khan Younis city area, around 170 people have been killed "and hundreds wounded" during an Israeli operation over several days there, Gaza's Civil Defence Agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It issued the toll after the military earlier on Saturday warned of new operations in the area and issued fresh evacuation orders for residents of Khan Younis, where troops had earlier recovered the bodies of five Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egyptian state-linked media said Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators are to meet with Israeli negotiators in the Italian capital on Sunday in the latest push for a Gaza truce, which critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have accused him of blocking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said more than 180,000 Palestinians had already fled fierce fighting in Khan Younis since the military operation began almost a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evacuation orders and "intensified hostilities" have "significantly destabilised aid operations," the UN said, reporting "dire water, hygiene and sanitation conditions" in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had warned last Monday that its forces would "forcefully operate" in the Khan Younis region – from where rockets had been fired – including an area previously declared a safe humanitarian zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan Younis was left devastated after heavy fighting early in the year but the military withdrew in April saying it had "concluded its mission" there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now it has returned in force. On Wednesday the military said troops carried out an operation in Khan Younis and retrieved the bodies of five Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had been killed during the October 7 attack on Israel and their bodies taken back to Gaza, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said on Friday that its forces had "eliminated approximately 100" militants in Khan Younis during the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said the captives' bodies were pulled from underground tunnels and walls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack that began the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,258 people, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its latest toll on Saturday included 83 deaths over the previous 48 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, the military ordered residents from more parts of Khan Younis "to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi" – the second such adjustment made to the safe zone within a week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further south, in Rafah, medics said on Saturday that four people were killed and several wounded in an air strike on a house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military on Saturday said troops had targeted "military infrastructure sites" in the Rafah area and "eliminated dozens" of militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Qahera news, which has links to Egyptian intelligence, reported on Friday that talks "to reach agreement on a truce in Gaza" would take place on Sunday in Rome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US news outlet Axios separately reported that CIA Director Bill Burns was expected to hold talks in Rome with Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest mediation efforts have focused on a ceasefire and hostage-release accompanied by the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. US President Joe Biden presented the framework in late May, billing it as an Israeli proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a meeting on Thursday in Washington, Biden called on Netanyahu to "finalise" a deal and "reach a durable end to the war in Gaza," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That same day, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which has regularly protested for a deal, alleged "deliberate sabotage" of talks and demanded an urgent meeting with Israeli negotiators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their accusation came after a source with knowledge of the talks said the arrival of Israeli negotiators in Qatar had been postponed from Thursday to this coming week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday called on the United States to return to a rational and pragmatic policy towards China as he urged Washington not to continue to stir up trouble in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang also urged the United States to "refrain from fanning the flames" in the territorial dispute between Beijing and the Philippines, the foreign ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US side should refrain from fanning the flames, stirring up trouble and undermining stability at sea," Wang said, according to a ministry statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Wang met with his US counterpart Antony Blinken on the sidelines of a foreign ministers meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US hailed the talks between Blinken and Wang as "open and productive" with the two sides discussing issues of mutual concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's talks lasted for one hour and twenty minutes, according to a senior US State Department official. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Olympic Committee apologised on Saturday for a gaffe during the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics in which South Korean athletes were incorrectly introduced as North Korean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the South Korean delegation sailed down the Seine river in the French capital, they were introduced with the official name for North Korea: "Republique populaire democratique de Coree" in French, then "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" in English.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We deeply apologise for the mistake that occurred when introducing the South Korean team during the broadcast of the opening ceremony," the IOC said in a post on its official Korean-language X account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The error sparked displeased reactions in South Korea, that is technically still at war with the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Korean Sport & Olympic Committee said later on Saturday that it had received a message from the IOC indicating that its chief, Thomas Bach, wished to directly apologise to the president of South Korea over the phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Korea's sports ministry said in a statement it "expresses regret" over the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second vice sports minister Jang Mi-ran, a 2008 Olympic weightlifting champion, has asked for a meeting with IOC chief Bach to discuss the matter, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's foreign ministry said in a statement it had contacted the French embassy in Seoul which expressed regret over what it said was an "incomprehensible mistake".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea was correctly introduced with the country's official name. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="High-speed trains across France suffered heavy traffic disruption following a 'coordinated sabotage' on Friday, ahead of the Olympics Opening Ceremony. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763379_1_20240727090641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French rail officials warned of travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of people throughout the weekend after saboteurs following a meticulous plan paralysed much of the train network on Friday as the Olympic Games started.
 <br>
  <br/>
  No immediate claim of responsibility was made for the arson attacks on cabling boxes at junctions strategically picked out north, southwest and east of the capital where the Olympics opening ceremony was staged on Friday night. Rail workers thwarted a fourth attempt to destroy safety equipment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNCF rail company called it a "massive attack".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilised to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts," Prime Minister Gabriel Attal posted on X, calling the attacks "prepared and coordinated acts of sabotage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services from Paris to much of France saw mass cancellations and delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Eurostar company said it scrapped about a quarter of its trains between London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. It predicted cancelling about a fifth of trains over the weekend and all services will face delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to take a plane instead of a high speed train to the Olympics ceremony. Four special trains bringing Olympic athletes to Paris, including some US team members, went ahead, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With one of France's busiest holiday travel weekends clashing with the start of the Olympics, SNCF said about a quarter of trains will be cancelled on Saturday and Sunday on the lines attacked. Trains that run will face delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said thousands of staff worked to repair the damage and try to get services running again. It estimated that about 250,000 passengers were affected on Friday. Junior transport minister Patrice Vergriete said 800,000 could face the fallout over the three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At each site, the perpetrators targeted fibre optic cables that carry safety information for drivers and control rail changes, SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gerard Due, mayor of Croisilles in northern France, one of the sites hit, said the attackers had specialised equipment to access the cables and then "threw a flammable liquid" on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vergriete said that the saboteurs had been spotted with "vans", while "incendiary devices were found at the scene".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French security forces are on their highest alert to prevent attacks during the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Olympic Games open on Friday after a soaking wet ceremony in which athletes were cheered by the crowd along the Seine as dancers took to the roofs of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France's three-time Olympic gold medallists Marie-Jose Perec and Teddy Riner then lit the Olympic cauldron, suspended on a hot-air balloon, before Canada's Celine Dion sang Edith Piaf's "Hymn to Love", in her first public performance in years, drawing huge cheers from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fleet of barges took the competitors on a 6 km-stretch of the river alongside some of the French capital's most famous landmarks, as performers recreated some of the sports to be showcased in the Games on floating platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time that an opening ceremony has taken place outside a stadium, adding to the headaches for a vast security operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I invite everybody: dream with us. Like the Olympic athletes, be inspired with the joy that only sport can give us. Let us celebrate this Olympic spirit of living in peace," International Olympics Committee President Thomas Bach said as the ceremony came to an end at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mix of French and international stars, including soccer great Zinedine Zidane, 14-times French Open champion Rafa Nadal, 23-times Grand Slam champion Serena Williams and three paralympic athletes were among the last torchbearers before the cauldron was lit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will blaze until the closing ceremony on August 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rain forced some fans to leave early, those who spoke to RTHK's Hailey Yip and Kelly Yu were impressed by what they saw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought it was very beautiful," one French spectator said. "Very artistic, very creative, very French, lots of contrast, lots of great pictures, so I think it was fabulous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, crowds cheered as the teams headed down the Seine on a series of barges. The Hong Kong, China team deployed umbrellas as heavy rain struck, with athletes including flag-bearers Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung snapping selfies along the way.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's police watchdog on Friday said it had launched a criminal probe into an incident caught on video in which an officer appeared to kick and stamp on a man's head while making an arrest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Greater Manchester Police in northwest England has suspended an officer from all duties following the incident at Manchester Airport on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can confirm we are conducting a criminal investigation into the use of force during events which took place on 23 July at Manchester Airport," said Catherine Bates, regional director of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer involved would be formally interviewed "as soon as possible," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video, which has circulated online, caused public outrage and two nights of protests in Manchester and nearby Rochdale. The IOPC said it was looking at the "level of force" used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greater Manchester Police has said that three officers were assaulted, with one female officer "suffering a broken nose" and requiring hospital treatment, while apprehending a suspect at the airport following reports of an assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Details of what happened immediately before and after the video remain unclear. Police said the "use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said after seeing the full footage leading up to the circulated clip that it was "not a clearcut situation" and that while the clip was "disturbing," there were issues "on both sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two men were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of assault and assault of an emergency worker among other counts.

    Olympic Games a chance to 'silence the guns': Guterres

<div class="itemFullText">
 United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged countries around the world to stop armed conflict as part of the Olympic truce, with the Paris 2024 Olympics set to open later on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Guterres met International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and said the Games were a chance for peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to express the total support of the United Nations to the IOC," Guterres said. "We live in a divided world where conflicts are proliferating in a dramatic way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The horrendous suffering in Gaza, the seemingly endless war in Ukraine, terrible suffering from Sudan to the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo), from the Sahel to Myanmar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a moment like this it is important to say that the first recorded, in history, real peace initiative was the Olympic truce."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the Olympics in ancient Greece all conflicts ceased for the duration of the Games to allow for the competitions to go ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a moment in which the Olympic Games will start it is time to remind the world of the importance of the Olympic truce and to make the world understand that we must silence the guns," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Games kick off later on Friday and end on August 11 with the participation of more than 10,500 athletes representing 206 nations and territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include a Palestinian team, which while not a full member of the United Nations, has an official national Olympic Committee, as well as athletes from Russia and Belarus, who will compete as neutrals without a flag or emblem following the assault on Ukraine in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So this is the moment in which my strong appeal is for countries to come together with the same spirit as athletes will be coming together during the Olympic Games in Paris," Guterres said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladeshi police detectives on Friday forced the discharge from hospital of three student protest leaders blamed for deadly unrest, taking them to an unknown location.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Asif Mahmud, Nahid Islam and Abu Baker Majumder are all members of Students Against Discrimination, the group responsible for organising recent street rallies against civil service hiring rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 193 people were killed in the ensuing police crackdown and clashes, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, in some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio were being treated for injuries that they said were caused by torture in earlier police custody at a hospital in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They took them from us," Gonoshasthaya hospital supervisor Anwara Begum Lucky said. "The men were from the Detective Branch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that she had not wanted to discharge the student leaders but police had pressured the hospital chief to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islam's elder sister Fatema Tasnim said from the hospital that six plainclothes detectives had taken all three men. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former US president Barack Obama endorsed his fellow Democrat Kamala Harris' bid for the White House on Friday, delivering a major boost to her campaign to defeat Donald Trump in November's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's first woman vice president is seeking to make history again in November after President Joe Biden abruptly announced he would not seek re-election after weeks of mounting pressure on him to quit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barack and Michelle Obama's backing will add to the growing momentum behind Harris' campaign, with polls showing she has already narrowed the gap that existed between Trump and Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Earlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend Kamala Harris. We told her we think she'll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support," Obama said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this critical moment for our country, we're going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you'll join us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The influential former leader and first black US president was one of the last Democratic heavy hitters to offer his endorsement, with Harris having already received the backing of Biden on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, jumped into the election after weeks of turmoil over 81-year-old Biden, who bowed out after a dismal debate performance against Trump accelerated concerns over his mental capacity and persistently low polling numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since launched a blistering attack on Trump and his "extremist" Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Harris addressed the American Federation of Teachers – the first union to endorse her bid – warning the country was witnessing a "full-on attack" by Trump's Republicans on "hard-won, hard-fought freedoms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic Party delegates have rapidly rallied en masse behind Harris, and the momentum behind her campaign has appeared to catch Trump off guard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bombastic Republican has refused to schedule a debate with Harris, saying Thursday night it would be "inappropriate" until she was officially named the Democratic nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, a former top prosecutor for California, chided her opponent on X, saying: "What happened to 'any time, any place?'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had previously said of a potential September 10 face-off: "I'm ready. So let's go." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's rail network was paralysed on Friday by what authorities called coordinated acts of sabotage, which knocked out most of its high-speed train services hours before the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At Paris' Gare du Nord station, a Hongkonger living in the UK said he may have to call off his trip to Brussels because his train had been delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at the station half an hour early and saw my train was delayed for half an hour. And the train is getting delayed further. I’m afraid that it may be cancelled and my schedule will be a mess."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rail operator SNCF said three night-time arson attacks had destroyed cabling boxes at strategic junctions around its network at locations north, south-west and east of Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth attempted act of vandalism south-east of the capital was thwarted by rail workers who spotted intruders in the early hours of Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilised to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts", Prime Minister Gabriel Attal posted on X, calling the attacks "prepared and coordinated acts of sabotage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics are set to open in a spectacular and unprecedented ceremony on the river Seine on Friday evening, with many ticket holders set to travel to the City of Light by train.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With some trains on the Eurostar network – whose routes include Paris to London – cancelled, a traveller in the UK, Saloni Modi, said she was worried she could not make the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nervous about missing it, yes. Because it's something that we've planned and we're looking forward to, and it's almost like a once in a lifetime because you don't get to go to that all the time. So we're hoping we make it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French officials refused to comment on the identity of the culprits of the rail sabotage who appear to have had a sophisticated understanding of the network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the rail disruption, which will affect 800,000 people over the weekend, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach told the media that he had no concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have full confidence in the French authorities," he said at the Athletes' Village.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The USA basketball team was also set to take a high-speed train to play their opening game on Sunday against Serbia in Lille, northern France. (Additional reporting by AFP and Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans from around the world gathered by the River Seine in Paris on Friday for the first-ever Olympics opening ceremony outside a stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of boats were to take athletes on a 6-kilometre journey along the river, past major landmarks including the Notre Dame and the Louvre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 300,000 spectators, including VIPs and celebrities from around the world, were expected to enjoy the show from the river banks – a big difference compared to the last Olympics in Tokyo, when the Covid pandemic meant the Games opened in an empty stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A little rain in Paris didn't stop spectators from waiting along the river banks hours before the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca, a tourist from the United States, said going to the Games was on her bucket list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That's why we came, when we found out that four years ago… they were going to have their opening ceremony going down the Seine, we decided that we have to be here,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s amazing, just because you have such a beautiful city and then the Olympics, which is number one on my bucket list to go to an Olympics in what other place to be than Paris.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tight security measures were put in place to ensure safety, including restricting most of the River Seine, and requiring visitors to present a QR code.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours before the ceremony,  France’s high-speed network was hit by arson attacks, forcing many services to be cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ed Settle from North Carolina said he was looking forward to the ceremony in spite of the trouble getting to the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will be interesting to see because it’s the first [ceremony] without the stadium, so I guess how the city can handle it but also how spectators will also be able to handle it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We just were able to find this opening here. We've been walking a little bit. Definitely can make it a little bit easier to navigate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening ceremony, from 1.30am Hong Kong time, is expected to last around four hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing champion Edgar Cheung and swimming star Siobhan Haughey are the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China delegation.

    <![CDATA[<img alt='A senior US administration official says negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the "closing stages" and that Biden would try to close some "final gaps" with Netanyahu. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763184_1_20240726015819.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday he was ready to work with Joe Biden for the rest of his presidency, as the two leaders met for the first time at the White House for talks on a Gaza ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to thank you for the 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel," Netanyahu said after they shook hands in the historic setting of the Oval Office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden stunned the world on Sunday when he announced that he was bowing out of the US presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris now set to be the Democratic Party's candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu will also meet Harris separately at the White House, in a reflection of the new political reality that will see Biden as a lame duck president for his remaining six months in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris meeting comes amid speculation that if she wins in November it could herald a tougher approach on Israel's war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between Biden and Netanyahu are tense over Israel's conduct in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attacks, but the US president has continued strong military and political support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have met just three times during his presidency, once in September last year in New York, and then when Biden travelled to Israel after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu on the airport tarmac at Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meetings come after Netanyahu vowed "total victory" against Hamas in a fiery speech Wednesday to the US Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Netanyahu will later meet the families of US hostages held in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House was surrounded by metal barriers and a heavy police presence, after rowdy protests broke out near the Capitol following Netanyahu's speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris on Thursday condemned the "despicable" and "unpatriotic" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a primetime speech explaining his decision on Sunday to bow out of the US presidential election, Biden made clear that resolving the conflict would remain a top priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to keep working to end the war on Gaza, bring home all the hostages to bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war," the US president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior US administration official said on Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the "closing stages" and that Biden would try to close some "final gaps" with Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris has previously been more outspoken about Israel's conduct of the war, prompting speculation she will shift her policy as presidential nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US official said there was "no daylight between the president and vice president," who will meet Netanyahu at 4:30 pm (2030 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu will meet Republican contender Donald Trump on Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ex-president on Thursday morning urged Israel to quickly "finish up" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has offered Israel steadfast support since October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the US president has been increasingly critical of Israel over the Palestinian death toll in its offensive in Gaza, and criticised restrictions on the amount of aid getting through to the territory, much of which has been reduced to rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures. Out of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Israeli military 327 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza military campaign since the start of the ground offensive on October 27. (AFP)

    Parisians look forward to dipping into the Seine again

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Paris Olympics just around the corner, the French capital is a step closer to the dream of swimming in the River Seine again, as bacteria levels go down to an acceptable level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swimming in the iconic river has been banned since 1923, but athletes and Parisians may soon be able to take a dip thanks to cleanup efforts for the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Historically there's been pollution from industry, from farms upstream of Paris, and then from the city itself, from frankly raw sewage that goes into the river,” said Matthew Heberger, a Paris-based hydrologist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest water quality tests show that the river is mostly safe for swimming under standards set by international swimming and triathlon federations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the biggest risk, as Heberger explained, is "that if there's a large rainstorm in the 24 hours before one of the swimming events that could wash a lot of storm water off of the land surfaces around the city which brings with it pollution".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From July 30, the Seine is set to host outdoor swimming events during the Games. But the triathlon could be postponed or changed to a duathlon without swimming if the river water is unsafe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR triathlete Jason Ng is expecting to race in the river that day. But while he cannot guarantee that his event will go ahead, Ng said he will just focus on what he can control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would prefer the swim not to be cancelled as I've qualified for triathlon, and I would prefer to actually race the event that I've qualified for in the Olympics,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course having the swim cancelled will favour some athletes who are not as strong swimmers, but again I think you just have to deal with what comes.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip in the Seine in mid-July to convince doubters that the water is safe enough for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local surnamed Boutin told RTHK that he too wants to take a dip if all goes well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be a new future for Paris and I think it’s going to be a good thing. It was a little browner, now it’s greenish. There’s a colour change,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And another Parisian, Kelfa, said he hopes the river will stay clean so people can swim even after the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I do believe the numbers of the studies, like they’ve been saying recently it was too high of bacteria for us to swim in it, which I do believe,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And now apparently they’ve invested a lot to clean it and the numbers are better. I guess we should trust them.”

    Natural regeneration of forests often better: study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Countries have pledged to plant billions of trees to tackle climate change, but half the time letting forests regenerate naturally would be a better option, a major study said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are places where it makes sense to plant trees, and there are places where it makes sense to naturally regenerate forests," Jacob Bukoski, one of the authors of the study told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to sequester carbon at the lowest cost, some combination of natural regeneration and plantations makes a lot of sense," said the researcher at Oregon State University in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Restoring forests has massive potential to help limit rising global temperatures because trees absorb heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study, which spanned 138 countries and was published in the journal Nature Climate Change, compared the cost and climate benefits of planting one tree species in an area or allowing natural forest regrowth -- two common reforestation approaches --- over a 30-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that in 46 percent of the studied areas, letting forests grow back naturally was the more cost-effective option. The rest of the time, plantations were found to be cheaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It suggests that the current heavier emphasis on plantations within national reforestation programmes could be leading to missed opportunities for cost-effective climate mitigation," the study said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous research has shown that as much as two-thirds of reforestation commitments in the tropics are plantations, said Bukoski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years there has been "a proliferation of single species plantations to try to meet climate goals," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-growing single species plantations -- also called monoculture -- are more costly to implement but provide revenue from the production and sale of wood products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the wood is harvested, a portion of the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere -- but the rest is trapped in the timber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naturally regenerated forests grow more slowly but are more biodiverse and store a greater amount of carbon over a longer time period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said their mapping could help guide international initiatives and countries' plans to cut emissions by presenting a more nuanced approach to reforestation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found that natural regeneration was especially cost-effective in much of western Mexico, the Andean region, the Southern Cone of South America, west and central Africa, India, southern China, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conversely, plantations proved the better option in large parts of the Caribbean, Central America, Brazil, north, east and southern Africa, northern China, mainland Southeast Asia and the Philippines. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People wait to collect food from a soup kitchen in Omdurman in Sudan. A new report from UN agencies says about 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763015_1_20240724234356.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conflict, economic turbulence and extreme weather scuppered efforts to curb hunger last year, with around nine percent of the world's population affected, UN agencies said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023, a level that has held steady for three years after a steep rise following the Covid-19 pandemic, they said in a report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the picture is uneven. While hunger affected one in every five people in Africa, compared with a global average of one in 11, Latin America and the Caribbean progressed and Asia stalled in the goal of eliminating undernourishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broader goal of securing regular access to adequate food for everyone also stalled in that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate or severe food insecurity, which forces people to occasionally skip meals, hit 2.33 billion people last year -- almost 29 percent of the global population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization suggests the UN goal of a world without hunger by 2030 is fading further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conflicts, climate chaos and economic downturns are already known as major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition that combine with underlying factors including persistent inequality, the unaffordability of healthy diets and unhealthy food environments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But these major drivers are becoming more frequent and intense -- and occurring concurrently more often -- meaning more people are exposed to hunger and food insecurity, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A healthy diet was unaffordable for more than one third of the world's population in 2022, the report added, citing updated estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here too regional inequalities were stark: more than 71 percent of people in low-income countries could not afford healthy diets, compared with just over six percent in high-income nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to David Laborde, an economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization and one of the report's authors, the post-Covid economic rebound was unequal within and between countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wars and extreme weather events also raged unabated in 2023, but the world has failed to put in place a "Marshall Plan" to bolster funds earmarked for fighting hunger, he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN agencies' report, which was presented for a G20 summit in Brazil, suggested a major reform of financing food security and nutrition to alleviate the scourge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would start with adopting common definitions putting all actors on the same page. According to current estimates, between $176 billion and $3,975 billion are needed to eradicate hunger by 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet the "highly fragmented" financial architecture "makes the scale-up and effective implementation of financing for food security and nutrition unfeasible", the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donors, international agencies, NGOs and foundations must coordinate better as the current set-up lacks shared priorities and is characterised by "an over-proliferation of actors delivering mostly small, short-term projects", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Food security and nutrition is not simply a question of "distributing bags of rice in emergency situations", Laborde said, but also aid to small-scale farmers and access to energy in rural areas that could electrify irrigation systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another weakness of the current system is that donor intentions do not always meet the needs of populations, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Debates over animal husbandry in some European countries may discourage investment in intensifying it in Africa, which is necessary, said Laborde. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepali officials said at least 18 people were killed when a small plane crashed and caught fire while it was taking off from Nepal's capital Kathmandu on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Saurya Airlines flight was carrying two crew and 17 of the company's staff members for a test flight, Nepali police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pilot has been rescued and is being treated. It is not possible to confirm the status of others on board right now. Many have not survived," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plane crashed at around 11:15 am local time, the military said in a statement, adding the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News portal Khabarhub reported the airplane had caught fire after skidding on the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's most trafficked air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, according to its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Belarus's top diplomat arrived in Pyongyang for a four-day visit, North Korean state media said Wednesday, as the two heavily sanctioned countries look to deepen ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "At the invitation of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK, Maxim Ruzenkov, foreign minister of the Republic of Belarus, arrived here on Tuesday to pay an official visit," the official Korean Central News Agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruzenkov's trip comes as the two states strengthened ties with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea will "deepen ties with Minsk on all fronts to open a new era of improved relationships," Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui said at a dinner welcoming the Belarusian delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruzenkov was reported as saying Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un both hoped to nurture a closer relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, the European Union agreed on new sanctions against Belarus over its role in the Ukraine war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, Russian leader Vladimir Putin made his first visit to North Korea in 24 years and signed a strategic treaty with leader Kim, including a commitment to come to each other's aid if attacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul and Washington have accused North Korea of supplying ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war, and the new treaty has fuelled fears of more deliveries. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from two landslides in southern Ethiopia has jumped to 229 and could rise further as the search for survivors and casualties continued into a second day, a government official said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following heavy rain, a landslide buried people in Gofa zone in Southern Ethiopia regional state on Sunday night, then a second one engulfed others who had gathered to help on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know when it will stop. We are still recovering bodies," Markos Melese, head of the National Disaster Response agency in Gofa Zone, told Reuters by phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still digging."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday an official said at least 50 people had died and children and police officers were among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage shared by the local administration showed people digging up bodies with shovels and bare hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The death toll surged after the people who came to rescue also got trapped," said Gofa district administrator Misikir Mitiku. "It is a very sad incident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he was deeply saddened by the terrible loss of life, and that federal officials had been deployed to reduce the impact of the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We stand in strong solidarity with the people and Government of Ethiopia as rescue efforts continue to find the missing and assist the displaced," African Union chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is Ethiopian, said he was thinking of all the families affected and that a WHO team had been sent to support immediate health needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the region continues to face the harsh impacts of climate change, we urge everyone to stay vigilant and follow safety protocols to protect lives and prevent further tragedies," said Workneh Gebeyehu, executive secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a regional bloc.

    Balloon trash falls on S Korea presidential palace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Trash-carrying balloons sent by North Korea hit the South Korean presidential compound Wednesday prompting Seoul to mobilise chemical response teams. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762928_1_20240724114054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Trash from at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound on Wednesday, raising worries about the security of key South Korean facilities from North Korean provocations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the first time the South Korean leader's office in downtown Seoul, which is protected by scores of soldiers and a no-fly zone, had been directly hit by any of the thousands of trash-carrying balloons launched by Pyongyang since May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The chemical, biological and radiological (warfare) response team has safely collected the trash balloons," the presidential security service told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After investigation, results have confirmed that there were no danger or contamination of the object," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But experts said South Korea needs to shoot incoming North Korean balloons at border areas next time, as it was not clear whether North Korea would put in hazardous items in future campaigns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea's latest balloon launches came days after South Korea boosted its frontline broadcasts of K-pop songs and propaganda messages across the rivals’ heavily armed border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their tit-for-tat Cold War-style campaigns are inflaming tensions, with the rivals threatening stronger steps and warning of grave consequences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul officials earlier said North Korea had used the direction of winds to fly balloons toward South Korea, but some of the past balloons had timers that were likely meant to pop the bags of trash midair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The security service gave no further details about the rubbish found at the presidential compound, like whether balloons were discovered along with the trash. (Agencies)

    Harris throws down gauntlet to Trump in Milwaukee

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris addresses voters in Wisconsin, one of several Rust Belt states that are crucial to the Democrats' chances of defeating Donald Trump. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762880_1_20240724034802.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over Trump, the Republican nominee.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In this campaign, I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week," she told a cheering crowd of several thousands at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a crucial battleground state in the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?" she asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris led Trump 44 percent to 42 percent among registered voters in the national Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Biden dropped out of the contest on Sunday and endorsed Harris as his successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous surveys taken before Biden's exit found Harris and Trump tied at 44 percent a week ago and Trump ahead of her by a percentage point at the beginning of the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In all three cases, the difference was within the poll's 3-point margin of error, but the results could signal some limited movement in Democrats' direction - and may suggest that Harris' elevation to the top of the ticket blunted whatever momentum Trump may have gained from last week's Republican National Convention, also in Milwaukee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris swiftly consolidated her party's support after Biden, 81, abandoned his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who worried about his ability to beat Trump or to serve for another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She wrapped up the nomination on Monday night by winning pledges from a majority of the delegates who at next month's party convention will determine the nominee, the campaign said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters were unhappy with their options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saddled with concerns that included his health and persistent high prices crimping Americans' household finances, Biden had been losing ground against Trump in opinion polls, particularly in the competitive states that are likely to decide the election, including Wisconsin and the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Nevada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Wisconsin event offered another opportunity for Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, to reset the Democrats' campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris has been raking in campaign contributions. Her campaign said on Monday she had raised US$100 million since Sunday, topping the US$95 million that the Biden campaign had in the bank at the end of June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, that are critical for Democrats' chances of defeating Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are independents and young people who did not like their choices, and Harris has a chance to win them," said Paul Kendrick, executive director of the Democratic group Rust Belt Rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, a Democrat, said Harris could also help bring back crucial Black voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of them didn't come along because they were distracted by his (Biden's) age, distracted by his appearance," he said. (Reuters)

    New world heat record set in July: Copernicus

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Climate change is causing more frequent extreme weather events, including heatwaves and prolonged droughts. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762877_1_20240724025615.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 July 21 was the hottest day ever registered globally, according to preliminary data published Tuesday by the EU's climate monitor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said the global average surface air temperature of 17.09 degrees Celsius (62.7 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday was the warmest in their record books, which go back to 1940.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as heatwaves and wildfires ravage swathes of Europe and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Earth has just experienced its warmest day," the monitor said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new daily high was 0.01 degree Celsius above the previous record temperature of 17.08 registered on July 6, 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On July 21st, C3S recorded a new record for the daily global mean temperature," C3S director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though just a tiny rise above the previous record, what was "truly staggering" was the streak of unprecedented global heat recorded over the past 13 months, Buontempo added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every month since June 2023 has eclipsed its own temperature record compared to the same month in previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copernicus said in this context, and at the peak of the northern hemisphere summer, it was not "completely unexpected" that this new daily high would be breached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be eclipsed by the soaring heat experienced earlier this week, the monitor said, pointing to a streak of record-breaking days that occurred in July and August 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global temperatures were expected to peak and drop soon though there could be further fluctuations in coming weeks, Copernicus said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate change is causing longer, stronger and more frequent extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods, and this year has been marked by major disasters across the globe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deadly heatwaves have already hit North America, Mexico, India and Thailand this year, to name a few, while flooding has devastated parts of East Africa, China and Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires are torching a path across southern and eastern Europe and in Canada and the United States as prolonged scorching temperatures in parts of the northern hemisphere make conditions tinder dry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming but emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases keep rising, despite international efforts to switch to clean energy and slow rising temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2023 was the hottest year on record and 2024 could follow in step considering the "sufficiently warm" temperatures experienced to date, Copernicus said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was "too early to predict with confidence" which would be hotter between the years, it added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former US president and the Republican Party's presidential candidate, Donald Trump, sustained a two-centimetre wound on his right ear in the assassination attempt. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762875_1_20240724015556.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after acknowledging that the agency failed in its mission to prevent an assassination attempt against Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheatle was facing bipartisan calls to step down after a 20-year-old gunman wounded the former Republican president and current White House candidate at a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is overdue, she should have done this at least a week ago," Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters. "I'm happy to see that she has heeded the call of both Republicans and Democrats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden thanked Cheatle for her nearly three decades in the Secret Service and said she had "selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect our nation throughout her career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all know what happened that day can never happen again," Biden said in a statement. "As we move forward, I wish Kim all the best, and I will plan to appoint a new director soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle appeared before a congressional oversight committee on Monday and said the attack on Trump, who was slightly wounded in his right ear, represented a failure by the Secret Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called it "the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Republicans and Democrats called on Cheatle to resign during a tense hearing. She drew the ire of lawmakers from both parties by refusing to provide specific details about the attack, citing the existence of multiple active investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gunman opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after he began speaking at the campaign event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perched on the roof of a nearby building, he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper less than 30 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators have concluded the young man, who lived in a town about 50 miles (80 kilometres) from Butler, acted alone, and have not been able to identify any strong ideological or political leanings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two rally attendees were seriously wounded in the attack and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter, Corey Comperatore, was shot dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's former physician said over the weekend that the Republican candidate sustained a two-centimetre gunshot wound on his right ear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear," said ex-White House physician Ronny Jackson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle served as a Secret Service agent for 27 years before leaving in 2021 to become the head of security in North America for PepsiCo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was named to head the agency by President Joe Biden in 2022. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A video allegedly showing Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos inhaling a white powder has been denounced as "fake" and "malicious", with investigators on Tuesday presenting close-up images of his ear to prove it was not him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The clip featuring a dark-haired man was part of a video shown at a rally in Los Angeles that was organised by a political group linked to Marcos's predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rally was livestreamed on the Facebook page of pro-Duterte broadcaster SMNI in the Philippines early Monday local time, hours before Marcos was due to deliver his annual State of the Nation address to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is obvious from the video that that is not our president. Their video is fake and obviously not real," Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro said Monday, after the video went viral on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teodoro said it was part of a "serious plan to destabilise our government".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video spread rapidly on Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. One Facebook post was viewed at least eight million times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duterte's former spokesman Harry Roque shared it on his Facebook page with a caption in Tagalog reading: "You be the judge".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was viewed 17,000 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police forensic experts held a news conference on Tuesday to prove the man in the video was not the president, presenting photos of Marcos and the unidentified man to compare their facial features.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enlarged images of their faces and right ears were placed side by side to demonstrate that Marcos's ear was larger in proportion to his face and had a different shape to those of the other man, whose ear curled over at the top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Be it AI (artificial intelligence) or imposter or whatever it was, as far as the (police) is concerned that is not the president," Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos said Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is a different person based on the ear. That's not even considering the jawline and the entire facial structure," Abalos said, describing the video as "malicious".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Marcos and Duterte families have had a bitter, public falling out as they attempt to shore up their rival support bases and secure key positions ahead of the 2025 mid-term elections. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Russia on Tuesday pushed back against a US warning over their military and economic cooperation in the Arctic, where climate change is opening up greater competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing said it acts on the "principles of respect, cooperation, mutual wins and sustainability", adding it's committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States distorts China's Arctic policy and makes thoughtless remarks on China's normal Arctic activities (which are) in accordance with international law," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia "does its part to ensure that the Arctic does not become a territory of discord and tension."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that Russia's cooperation with China "contributes to an atmosphere of stability and predictability" in the Arctic, and their actions were not targeted against other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks said, "We've seen growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia in the Arctic commercially, with the PRC being a major funder of Russian energy exploitation in the Arctic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also growing military cooperation, "with Russia and China conducting joint exercises off the coast of Alaska," Hicks said as the department released its 2024 Arctic strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington's Arctic strategy describes the area as "a strategically important region" for the US that includes "the northern approaches to the homeland" and "significant US defence infrastructure." (Reporting by AFP)

    Hamas, Fatah sign landmark declaration in Beijing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi, centre, and members of various Palestinian factions attend the signing of the Beijing Declaration aimed at ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762795_1_20240723145747.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Tuesday announced it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an "interim national reconciliation government" to govern post-war Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it," Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian factions met with the media, with Wang present, CGTN said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among the factions held in Beijing from July 21-23, CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's attack on southern Israel last October, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to "reconciliation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza," he said following the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the factions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US media say Kamala Harris looks on track to win the decisive support of delegates before the Democratic National Convention. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762759_1_20240723104050.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris has received the support of enough Democratic delegates to win her party's presidential nomination, CNN and other US media reported late on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Harris will need the support of at least 1,976 pledged delegates out of nearly 4,000 in order to decisively secure the Democratic presidential nomination during an official vote in the coming weeks, a number which US outlets reported she has now surpassed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the Democratic Party plans to push forward with a virtual roll call in which delegates to its convention can choose a presidential nominee before they gather next month in Chicago — despite Harris being overwhelmingly favoured to replace US President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention rules committee will meet Wednesday to approve how the virtual roll call will work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It does not list a date for when virtual voting would begin, but Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the process will be completed by August 7 — or 12 days before the party's convention begins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are living through an unprecedented moment in history and, as a party, we are tackling it with the seriousness that it deserves,” Harrison said on a conference call with reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are prepared to undertake a transparent, swift and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a nominee who represents our values.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Democrats "can, and will, be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden dropped out of the presidential race on Sunday, ending weeks of fighting among Democrats, many of whom feared he was not up to the rigours the campaign — much less a second term — following his poor debate against Repulican nominee Donald Trump last month. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A gunman entered a nursing home in northwestern Croatia on Monday shooting dead five people, including his mother, and injuring six others, a government minister said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One of the wounded later died in hospital taking the death toll to six, while four remain in critical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the victims was a nursing home employee, according to Marin Piletic, minister for labour, pension, family and social policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information we have the mother of the killer had been in the nursing home for 10 years," Piletic said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have given no motive for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatian media reported that the gunman, born in 1973, is a war veteran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are shocked," Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic told reporters in Split.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is really a monstrous act of the murder of a group of people, of the mother and other very old people who happened to be there.... We condemn this crime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killer fled the scene, but was later arrested by the police, N1 news portal reported. (Reuters)

    Harris hails Biden's legacy in White House speech

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris lauded President Joe Biden for his service to the country in her first public appearance on Monday since he abruptly abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed her as his successor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Joe Biden's legacy over the last three years is unmatched in modern history," Harris said at a White House event to honour college athletes. "Every day, our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris did not specifically refer to her new status as the leading Democratic candidate for president, after Biden stepped aside on Sunday under growing pressure from fellow Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campaign officials and allies have already made hundreds of calls on Harris' behalf, urging delegates to next month's Democratic Party convention to join in nominating her for president in the November 5 election against Republican Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's departure was the latest shock to a White House race that included the near-assassination of former President Trump by a gunman during a campaign stop and the nomination of Trump's fellow hardliner, US Senator J.D. Vance, as his running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris said in a post on X that she would visit what had been the Biden campaign headquarters in Delaware – now the Harris campaign headquarters – on Monday afternoon. She said Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 last week, was feeling better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Virtually all of the prominent Democrats who had been seen as potential challengers to Harris have lined up behind her, including Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle admitted to Congress on Monday that she and her agency failed when a would-be assassin wounded Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We failed," Cheatle, who faces Republican calls for her removal, said in testimony before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee. "The assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July 13th is the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the face of Republican claims that the Secret Service denied resources to protect Trump, she said security for the former president had grown ahead of the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The level of security provided for the former president increased well before the campaign and has been steadily increasing as threats evolve," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the Secret Service provided the security sought by the Trump campaign for the rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I can tell you is that for the event on July 13, the details that were requested, the assets that were requested for that day, were given," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She declined to answer specific questions about the day's security plan from Republicans and Democrats, saying the matter was being investigated internally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's hearing marked the first round of congressional oversight of the attempted assassination. On Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray will appear before the House Judiciary Committee. And House Speaker Mike Johnson is also due to unveil a bipartisan task force to serve as a nexus point for House investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle has resisted calls for her resignation from top Republicans including Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Republican House Oversight Committee James Comer echoed those calls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is my firm belief, Director Cheatle, that you should resign," the Kentucky Republican told her. "The Secret Service has thousands of employees and a significant budget. But it has now become the face of incompetence." (Reuters)

    Republicans say Biden should go immediately

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than a dozen Republicans called on US President Joe Biden to step down on Sunday after he ended his re-election bid, saying that his unwillingness to continue to campaign raises questions about his ability to continue to govern.
 <br>
  <br/>
  House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, US Senator JD Vance – the just-nominated running mate of Donald Trump in the November 5 election – and other lawmakers urged the 81-year-old incumbent to step down from office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden insisted in his statement that he would finish his term, which ends January 20, 2025, and fellow Democrats blasted the calls as "ridiculous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough," said Johnson, who is next in line to the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's fellow Democrats for weeks had called on him to end his campaign after a disastrous June 27 debate against former President Trump in which Biden at times struggled to finish his thoughts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?" Vance tweeted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, including Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin, called on Biden's Cabinet to remove him from office by invoking the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution. Biden's Cabinet, composed of officials hand-picked by the president, is highly unlikely to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the resignation calls, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close associate of Biden, said, "I think that is ridiculous." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Many Democrats on Sunday quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After weeks of in-party fighting between Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind her is crucial just over 100 days before November's election. However, there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, not in his initial letter stepping down, but in a separate statement. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, lawmakers including US Senator Patty Murray, and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said on social media platform X. "Democrats – it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris "the American dream personified," noting she was the daughter of immigrants. "She is also toughness personified, rising from my hometown of Oakland, California, to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, others including Pelosi thanked Biden for his patriotism but did not yet throw their support behind Harris or any other candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Senator Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an open process to nominate Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democrats should have “an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party,” he said. “The debate in the Democratic Party is who can carry on the legacy of President Biden and defeat Trump.” (Reuters)

    Biden quits re-election bid, backs VP Harris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost faith in his mental acuity and ability to beat Donald Trump while endorsing Vice President Kamal Harris to replace him as the party's candidate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, in a post on X, said he will remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025 and will address the nation this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His initial statement had not included an endorsement of Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with an expression of support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to run at the top of a major-party ticket in the country's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party's nomination – she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials – or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's announcement follows a wave of public and private pressure from Democratic lawmakers and party officials to quit the race after his shockingly poor performance in a June 27 televised debate last month against Republican rival Trump, 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump's performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden's fitness for another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's historic move – the first sitting president to give up his party's nomination for reelection since President Lyndon Johnson in March 1968 – leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Harris emerges as the nominee, the move would represent an unprecedented gamble by the Democratic Party: its first Black and Asian American woman to run for the White House in a country that has elected one Black president and never a woman president in more than two centuries of democracy.

    Paris rejects 4,000 Games accreditation requests

<div class="itemFullText">
 French security services rejected more than 4,000 applications for Paris 2024 Olympics accreditations, including over espionage and cyberattack concerns, the country's caretaker interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gerald Darmanin said French authorities have so far checked close to one million accreditation requests for the Games that kick off on July 26 and had rejected 4,340 people, some over radical Islamist connections or suspicion of being foreign spies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to one hundred were rejected over espionage fears or concerns they were agents trying to get an accreditation using a different profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are probably not there to carry out attacks. But in addition to intelligence and traditional espionage, there is the possibility of accessing entry points into computer networks to carry out a cyberattack," Darmanin told the weekly Journal du Dimanche.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they had applied as journalists or technical staff and their countries of origin were Russia and Belarus, among others, which he did not name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we refused a large number of 'journalists' who claimed to cover the Games. On the other hand, we accepted the presence of Russians who work for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We apply the precautionary principle," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian journalists have been allowed to get accredited for the Games and have already arrived in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris will be deploying 45,000 security personnel to guarantee the safety of the Games and its unique opening ceremony along the river Seine where athletes will float on barges past hundreds of thousands of spectators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers have reduced the initial number of spectators from 600,000 to around 300,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To our knowledge, we have no known threat to the security of the Olympic Games," Darmanin said. "In the past days I did a new reconnaissance by boat on the Seine with the police. I confirm that the ceremony will take place in the format announced by the President of the Republic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the flow of the river and the low risk of bad weather, there is – to date – no identified threat to the Games. Neither our intelligence services nor the foreign services with which we coordinate have detected any foreign threat. But you have to stay very humble and focused." (Reuters)

    Bangladesh scraps most job quotas that sparked riots

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bangladesh's top court scales back job quotas that triggered days of deadly unrest. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762546_1_20240721170912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladesh’s top court on Sunday scaled back a controversial quota system for government job applicants after it led to nationwide unrest and deadly clashes between police and protesters that killed scores of people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court in its verdict ordered 93 percent of government jobs to be allocated on a merit-based system, leaving the remaining seven percent for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971 and other categories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the system reserved 30 percent of such jobs for the relatives of war veterans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunday's verdict comes after weeks of demonstrations — mostly led by students — that turned deadly on Tuesday after protesters began clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the week, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and hurled smoke grenades to scatter stone-throwing protesters who filled the streets and university campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sporadic clashes in some parts of Dhaka, the capital, were reported on Saturday but it was not immediately clear whether there were any fatalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladeshi authorities haven’t shared any official numbers of those killed and injured, but the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reported Saturday that at least 103 people have died so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the court's hearing, soldiers patrolled cities across the South Asian country, while a nationwide curfew and an internet blackout remained in force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the curfew will be relaxed from 3 pm to 5 pm on Sunday for people to run essential errands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government has declared Sunday and Monday as public holidays, with only emergency services allowed to operate. (AP)

    Trump holds first rally since assassination attempt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US presidential candidate Donald Trump, holding his first campaign rally since surviving an assassination attempt a week ago, rejected concerns he was a threat to America's democratic system, telling the crowd: "I took a bullet for democracy."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I'm not an extremist at all," the newly-crowned Republican presidential nominee continued at the rally in swing state Michigan, dismissing his reported links to Project 2025, a manifesto from the Heritage Foundation that has been characterised by opponents as an authoritarian, right-wing wish list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he mocked the rival Democratic Party, roiled by unprecedented pressure for US President Joe Biden to abandon his re-election bid, amid concerns over his age and fitness to serve, if re-elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have no idea who their candidate is...this guy [Biden] goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away. That's democracy," Trump told the 12,000-strong crowd of supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fiery, but typically rambling speech, the Republican riffed on his hardline immigration views, espoused falsehoods about migrant crime, and repeated his baseless claim that Democrats "rigged" the 2020 election. (AFP)

    N Korea resumes trash balloon flights: S Korea

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korea says North Korea has resumed sending balloons carrying trash across the border into the South. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762522_1_20240721115803.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean officials said North Korea launched more balloons likely carrying trash towards the South on Sunday, days after Seoul restarted blaring anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts across the border in retaliation for the North’s repeated balloon campaigns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Cold War-style psychological battle between the two Koreas is adding to tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the rivals threatening stronger steps against each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North Korean balloons were flying north of Seoul, the South Korean capital, after crossing the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the public should be alert for falling objects and report to police and military authorities if they see any balloons on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea’s latest balloon-flying is the ninth of its kind since late May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has floated more than 2,000 balloons to drop waste paper, scraps of cloth, cigarette butts, waste batteries and even manure on South Korea, though they have so far caused no major damage in South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has said the balloons were launched in response to South Korean activists sending political leaflets to the North via their own balloons. (AP)

    Airports start to return to normal after global outage

<div class="itemFullText">
 Planes were gradually taking off again on Saturday after global airlines, banks and media were thrown into turmoil by one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Airport Authority said most systems are operating normally again, but contingency plans remain in place, and mainland state media said Beijing's airports had not been affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passenger crowds had swelled at airports on Friday as dozens of flights were cancelled after an update to a programme operating on Microsoft Windows crashed systems worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday, officials said the situation had returned virtually to normal in airports across Germany and France, as Paris prepared to welcome millions for the Olympic Games starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple US airlines and airports across Asia said they had resumed operations, with check-in services restored in Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand, and mostly back to normal in India, Indonesia and at Singapore's Changi Airport as of Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft estimated Saturday that 8.5 million Windows devices were affected in the global IT crash, adding that the number amounted to less than one percent of all Windows machines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services", it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft said the issue began at 1900 GMT on Thursday, affecting Windows users running the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Saturday blog post, CrowdStrike said it had released an update on Thursday night that had caused a system crash and the infamous "blue screen of death" fatal error message.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said it had rolled out a fix for the problem, and the company's boss, George Kurtz, told US news channel CNBC he wanted to "personally apologise to every organisation, every group and every person who has been impacted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company also said it could take a few days for things to fully get back to normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's National Health Service was hobbled by the crash on Friday, preventing doctors from accessing patient records and booking appointments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "majority of systems... are now coming back online in most areas, however they are still running slightly slower than usual", an NHS spokesperson said, warning of disruption continuing into next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media companies were also hit, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its Friday morning news broadcasts. Australia's ABC also reported major difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian, British and German authorities warned of an increase in scam and phishing attempts following the outage, including people offering to help reboot computers and asking for personal information or credit card details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks in Kenya and Ukraine reported issues with their digital services, some mobile phone carriers were disrupted and customer services in a number of companies went down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of this outage is unprecedented, and will no doubt go down in history," said Junade Ali of Britain's Institution of Engineering and Technology, adding that the last incident approaching the same scale was in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While some airports halted all flights, in others airline staff resorted to manual check-ins for passengers, leading to long lines and frustrated travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of US flights were grounded, although airlines later said they were re-establishing their services and working through the backlog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior US administration official said Friday that "our understanding is that flight operations have resumed across the country, although some congestion remains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's largest airline Indigo said Saturday that operations had been "resolved", adding in a statement on X that the process of resuming normal operations would "extend into the weekend".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Low-cost carrier AirAsia said it was still trying to get back online and had been "working around the clock towards recovering its departure control systems".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said the issue was "not the result of or related to a cyberattack". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli warplanes struck the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida on Saturday, a day after a Houthi drone attack killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, the rebels said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement on social media, top Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam reported a "brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Axios news outlet cited US and Israeli officials as saying that Israel carried out the strikes in retaliation for a Houthi drone strike on Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi attack on Friday penetrated Israel's vaunted air defences and killed a civilian in a Tel Aviv apartment building, drawing Israeli threats of retaliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi-run health ministry said there were deaths and injuries in the Hodeida strikes but it did not give a toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement carried by the Houthi-run Al Masirah television, it said several people suffered "serious burns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage aired by Al Masirah, which has not been independently verified, showed a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness in Hodeida reported hearing several large explosions and seeing smoke over the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel pumps across the city closed following the attack, the correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hodeida has been hard hit by a series of strikes carried out by Britain and the United States since January in response to attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis have attacked at least 88 commercial vessels since November in a campaign they say targets Israeli-linked shipping in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza war. (AFP)

    Bangladesh army on streets as police shoot protesters

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Soldiers were patrolling Bangladeshi cities on Saturday to quell growing civil unrest sparked by student demonstrations, with riot police firing on protesters who defied a government curfew.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's violence has killed at least 123 people so far, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, and poses a monumental challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government curfew went into effect at midnight and the premier's office asked the military to deploy troops after police again failed to subdue widespread mayhem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The army has been deployed nationwide to control the law and order situation," said armed forces spokesman Shahdat Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The curfew will remain in effect until at least 10:00 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday, private broadcaster Channel 24 reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Streets in the capital Dhaka were almost deserted at daybreak, with troops on foot and in armoured personnel carriers patrolling the sprawling megacity of 20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But thousands returned to the streets later in the day in the residential neighbourhood of Rampura, with police firing at the crowd and wounding at least one person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our backs are to the wall," protester Nazrul Islam, 52, said at the scene. "There's anarchy going on in the country... They are shooting at people like birds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals have reported a growing number of gunshot deaths since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hundreds of thousands of people" had battled police across the capital on Friday, said police spokesman Faruk Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At least 150 police officers were admitted to hospital. Another 150 were given first aid treatment," he said, adding that two officers had been beaten to death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The protesters torched many police booths... Many government offices were torched and vandalised."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said that another two police officers were killed on Saturday, while four people admitted to intensive care succumbed to their injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more protesters were killed in the industrial town of Savar on Dhaka's outskirts, a major centre of Bangladesh's garment exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enam Medical College Hospital spokesman Zahidur Rahman confirmed the latter deaths, adding that "nine people came here with bullet wounds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for Students Against Discrimination, the main group organising the protests, said that two of its leaders had been arrested since Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a planned diplomatic tour but abandoned her plans after a week of escalating violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She has cancelled her Spain and Brazil tours due to the prevailing situation," said her press secretary Nayeemul Islam Khan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have called for an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the scheme benefits families loyal to Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the first deaths on Tuesday, protesters have begun demanding Hasina leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not about the rights of the students anymore," said business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, at the scene of the Rampura protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are here as the general public now," he added. "Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pierre Prakash of Crisis Group said the lack of competitive elections since Hasina took office had led to mounting public frustration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With no real alternative at the ballot box, discontented Bangladeshis have few options besides street protests to make their voices heard," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rising death toll is a shocking indictment of the absolute intolerance shown by the Bangladeshi authorities to protest and dissent," Babu Ram Pant of Amnesty International said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities imposed a nationwide internet shutdown on Thursday that remains in effect, severely hampering communication in and out of Bangladesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government websites remain offline and major newspapers including the Dhaka Tribune and Daily Star have been unable to update their social media platforms since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh Television, the state broadcaster, also remains offline after its Dhaka headquarters was set on fire by protesters the same day. (AFP)

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762403_1_20240720091646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations' highest court said on Friday that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible, in its strongest findings to date on the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advisory opinion by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, was not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law," President Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said Israel's obligations include paying restitution for harm and "the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a swift reaction, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the opinion as "fundamentally wrong" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICJ opinion also found that the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor "render aid or assistance" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the occupied territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called the opinion "historic" and urged states to adhere to it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade...no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation," Palestinian envoy Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague. (Reuters)

    Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong dies aged 80
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1762370-20240720.htm

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In power since 2011, Trong had enjoyed remarkable longevity in office. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762370_1_20240719235331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong died on Friday aged 80 "after a period of illness," the ruling Communist Party said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came a day after the party that Trong led said he would hand over power to focus on receiving medical treatment for an undisclosed medical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, state media announced Trong had passed away in the afternoon at a military hospital "due to old age and serious illness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be a special statement on the organisation of the funeral at the national level," state media added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trong's responsibilities have been handed to the country's largely ceremonial president, To Lam, a powerful former public security minister long seen as jockeying for the top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Politburo calls on the entire party, people and army to have absolute trust in the party's leadership and state management," it said on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's communist regime, which is in the midst of a complete overhaul, has undergone a series of upheavals in recent months, with ministers, business leaders and two presidents all falling from grace as part of a vast anti-corruption campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was voted in as president in May by Vietnam's rubber-stamp parliament after his predecessor was forced to resign as part of the anti-graft drive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said at the time that Lam, who was deputy head of the steering committee on anti-corruption matters, had weaponised investigations to take down his political rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Headed by the party general secretary, Vietnam's leadership structure gives the president the second-most authority, and also includes the prime minister and the head of the National Assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trong's poor health had fuelled widespread speculation that he would not be able to stay in power until the 2026 party congress, which is expected to appoint a successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In power since 2011, Trong enjoyed remarkable longevity in office, during a mandate that rights groups say has coincided with increasing authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known for being a technocrat and on good terms with Beijing, he structured the party around himself, benefiting from a decade of economic growth that strengthened his legitimacy. (AFP)

    Russia jails US reporter Gershkovich for 16 years

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Evan Gershkovich has spent almost 16 months in detention on charges the US government and his employer believe are fabricated. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762368_1_20240719233856.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US reporter Evan Gershkovich was sentenced by a Russian court on Friday to 16 years prison for "espionage", a verdict reached after just over three weeks of secretive court proceedings denounced by Washington as a sham.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia has a policy of not exchanging prisoners internationally unless they have already been convicted, potentially paving the way for the 32-year-old to be swapped in a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was sentenced to "punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of 16 years in a strict regime colony," Judge Andrei Mineyev said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich did not appear to react to the sentencing, standing in a glass defendants' cage in dark trousers and a T-shirt. He waved to his journalist colleagues as he was led away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Wall Street Journal correspondent, who pleaded not guilty, became the first journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Cold War when he was detained in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has spent almost 16 months in detention on charges the United States government and his employer believe are fabricated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist," the Journal's publisher Almar Latour and editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Press rights group Reporters Without Borders slammed the sentencing as "outrageous" and called for Gershkovich to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington believes he is being held as a bargaining chip to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His trial has moved rapidly since the first hearing in late June, with the prosecution and defence teams giving their final arguments on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other similar cases in Russia have dragged on far more slowly, with several weeks or even months between hearings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked on Friday, the Kremlin refused to be drawn into speculation about the prospect of a prisoner swap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin has provided no public evidence for the spying allegations against Gershkovich, saying only that he was caught "red-handed" spying on a tank factory in the Urals region and was working for the CIA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said on Friday that Gershkovich acted with "careful measures of secrecy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions are running extremely high between the countries over Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow and Washington have both said they are open to exchanging the reporter in a deal, but neither has given clues on when that might happen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that talks between US and Russian special services over possible prisoner exchanges were ongoing, without naming any specific individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has implied he wants to see the release of Vadim Krasikov, a Russian convicted in Germany of killing a Chechen separatist commander. German judges said it was an assassination orchestrated by Russian authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other US nationals detained in Russia are reporter Alsu Kurmasheva and ballerina Ksenia Karelina, who are both dual US-Russian citizens, and former US marine Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for spying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US-born son of Soviet emigres raised in New Jersey, Gershkovich had reported from Russia since 2017, still returning for reporting trips following Russia's Ukraine offensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Moscow's isolated Lefortovo prison, he communicated with friends and family in hand-written letters that revealed he had not lost hope about his situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At his first trial hearing on June 26, he spoke briefly to greet journalists and appeared smiling and cheerful, while revealing that his head had been fully shaved, as it was on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A United Nations working group this month stated that Gershkovich's detention on spying charges was "arbitrary" and called for his immediate release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Evan has never been employed by the United States government. Evan is not a spy," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has warned US citizens still in Russia to "depart immediately" due to the risk of wrongful arrest. (AFP)

    Airports, broadcasters worldwide hit by tech outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A global tech outage was disrupting operations in multiple industries on Friday, with airlines halting flights, some broadcasters off-air and everything from banking to healthcare hit by system problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United Airlines and Allegiant Air grounded flights citing communication problems. The order came shortly after Microsoft said it resolved its cloud services outage that impacted several low-cost carriers, though it was not immediately clear whether those were related.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A third party software outage is impacting computer systems worldwide, including at United. While we work to restore those systems, we are holding all aircraft at their departure airports," United said in a statement. "Flights already airborne are continuing to their destinations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's government said outages suffered by media, banks and telecoms companies there appeared to be linked to an issue at global cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to an alert sent by Crowdstrike to its clients, the company’s “Falcon Sensor” software is causing Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the “Blue Screen of Death”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alert, which was sent at 05.30GMT on Friday, also shared a manual workaround to rectify the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Crowdstrike spokesperson did not respond to emails or calls requesting comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no information to suggest the outage was a cyber security incident, the office of Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness said in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outages rippled far and wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The travel industry was among the hardest hit with airports around the world, including Tokyo, Amsterdam, Berlin and several Spanish airports reporting problems with their systems and delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International airlines, including Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned of problems with their booking systems and other disruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Britain, booking systems used by doctors were offline, multiple reports from medical officials on X said, while Sky News, one of the country's major news broadcasters was off air, apologising for being unable to transmit live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks and other financial institutions from Australia to India and South Africa warned clients about disruptions to their services, while LSEG Group reported an outage of its data and news platform Workspace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon's AWS cloud service provider said in a statement that it was "investigating reports of connectivity issues to Windows EC2 instances and Workspaces within AWS."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear whether all reported outages were linked to Crowdstrike problems or there were other issues at play. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump, centre, along with members of his family and his running mate, JD Vance, second right, greet party faithful on the final day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump, sombre and bandaged, accepted the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday at the Republican National Convention in a speech that described in detail the assassination attempt that could have ended his life just five days earlier before laying out a sweeping populist agenda, particularly on immigration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 78-year-old former US president, known best for his bombast and aggressive rhetoric, began his acceptance speech with a softer and deeply personal message that drew directly from his brush with death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moment by moment, the crowd listening in silence, Trump described standing onstage in Butler, Pennsylvania, with his head turned to look at a chart on display when he felt something hit his ear. He raised his hand to his head and saw immediately that it was covered in blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin’s bullet would have perfectly hit its mark,” Trump said. “And I would not be here tonight. We would not be together.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump’s address, the longest convention speech in modern history at just under 93 minutes, marked the climax and conclusion of a massive four-day Republican pep rally that drew thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to swing-state Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensing political opportunity in the wake of his near-death experience, the often bombastic Republican leader embraced a new tone he hopes will help generate even more momentum in an election that appears to be shifting in his favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart,” Trump said, wearing a large white bandage on his right ear, as he has all week, to cover a wound he sustained in the Saturday shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While he spoke in a gentler tone than at his usual rallies, Trump also outlined an agenda led by what he promises would be the largest deportation operation in US history. He repeatedly accused people crossing the US-Mexico border illegally of staging an “invasion.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, he teased new tariffs on trade and an “America first” foreign policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also falsely suggested Democrats had cheated during the 2020 election he lost, despite a raft of federal and state investigations proving there was no systemic fraud, and suggested “we must not criminalise dissent or demonise political disagreement” even as he has long called for prosecutions of his opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not mention abortion rights, an issue that has bedeviled Republicans ever since the US Supreme Court struck down a federally guaranteed right to abortion two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump nominated three of the six justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump at his rallies often takes credit for Roe being overturned and argues states should have the right to institute their own abortion laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nor did he mention the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in which Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has long referred to the people jailed for the riot as “hostages.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indeed, Trump barely mentioned Biden, often referring only to the “current administration.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was Donald Trump who destroyed our economy, ripped away rights, and failed middle class families,” said Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair, in a statement after the speech. “Now he pursues the presidency with an even more extreme vision for where he wants to take this country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention ends at an uncertain moment in the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With less than four months to go in the contest, major changes in the race are possible, if not likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's appearance came as Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, clings to his party’s presumptive nomination in the face of unrelenting pressure from key congressional allies, donors and even former President Barack Obama, who fear he may be unable to win reelection after his disastrous debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long pressed by allies to campaign more vigorously, Biden is instead in isolation at his beach home in Delaware after having been diagnosed with Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention has showcased a Republican Party reshaped by Trump since he shocked the GOP establishment and won over the party’s grassroots on his way to the party’s 2016 nomination. Rivals Trump has vanquished – including senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis – put aside their past criticisms and gave him their unqualified support.

    Trump to rally unified Republicans in grand finale

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump will get a hero's welcome on Thursday as he accepts the Republican Party's nomination to run for US president in a speech capping a convention dominated by the recent attempt on his life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 78-year-old will address the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin hoping to build momentum toward victory over President Joe Biden in the November election and a second term in the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supporters have been lining up all week to applaud the former president for his bravery since Saturday's assassination bid by a gunman at a Pennsylvania rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As some of his loyalists blamed Democrats' rhetoric for the attack, Trump said he had torn up a more aggressive version of his keynote address in favour of one to "unite our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just grateful we're going to hear from him. It's a miracle that his life was spared, and I really believe it was God's hand," said Teena Horlacher, a 50-year-old convention delegate from Utah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd love for him to talk about Saturday, what his feelings were."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has a 90-minute speaking slot, from 9:00 to 10:30 pm (0100 to 0230 GMT on Friday), according to a source familiar with the schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also set to address the convention are the world-famous retired professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, and longtime friend Dana White who is chief executive of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has attended multiple UFC bouts as he seeks to cultivate his image as an alpha-male stereotype and lock in younger male votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The schedule notably shows no speaking slot for former first lady Melania Trump, a clear break from tradition at modern-era US nominating conventions, where spouses have almost always taken the stage in bids to personalise the candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has seen his poll lead expand since Biden's dismal debate performance last month threw his party into chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican campaign has even been talking up Trump's chances in Democratic strongholds like Minnesota and Virginia, potentially forcing Biden funds and manpower away from defending his "blue wall" in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's keynote address on Thursday will be followed on television and online by millions, closing the convention by promising what his team calls "a new golden age for America."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It brings down the curtain on four days of speeches from elected officials, entertainers, industry figures and everyday Americans who mixed with some 50,000 Republicans attending the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gathering opened on Monday with a vote to confirm Trump as the party's nominee after he won almost every state's primary contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been the first convention over which Trump has had total control, after a 2016 edition hampered by party divisions and a second appearance in 2020 reined in by the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The schedule was designed around his image, with themes for each day playing on his "Make America Great Again" rallying cry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump set the tone when he walked slowly into the Fiserv Forum arena on the opening day – looking emotional and with a bandaged ear, just two days after the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The week also saw Trump name right-wing Senator JD Vance as his running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old author of "Hillbilly Elegy," a best-selling memoir about growing up poor in working-class America, is a one-time critic who has become one of Trump's most staunch backers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump himself was a diminished figure after his 2020 election loss and a subsequent riot at the US Capitol by his supporters, but he has spent much of the last four years reshaping Republican politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Installing close allies, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump on the Republican National Committee, the mercurial tycoon has effectively crushed dissent within the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is increasingly confident of victory – despite multiple legal problems and two impeachments clouding his first term – as Biden is reeling from weak polls and concerns over his health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 81, Biden has been facing growing calls from his own side to quit the race, and he suffered another blow on Wednesday when he was diagnosed with Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's a clearly stark contrast between the strength of President Trump and the weakness of President Biden," said Mississippi delegate Clifton Carroll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And I think he'll expand on that, and really send a message that the entire United States of America can get behind whether they're Republican, Democrat or Independent." (AFP)

    Biden, Netanyahu due to meet next week: White House

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden is still expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visits Washington next week but it will depend on his recovery from Covid, the White House said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We have every expectation that the two leaders will have a chance to see each other while prime minister Netanyahu is in town" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu is set to address the US Congress on Wednesday and Israeli media had reported a meeting with Biden on Monday, but Kirby said "I can't tell you at this point what that exactly is going to look like."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to make sure that the president's health and his recovery from Covid takes priority and if and how that might expect a discussion with the prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's war in Gaza will be top of the agenda for the meeting, with Biden pressing for a peace deal with Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden was suffering from mild symptoms after testing positive with Covid on Wednesday, Kirby said, taking him off the campaign trail just as he fights mounting calls from Democrats to quit his reelection bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kirby said that neither the political turmoil nor his illness had affected his duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While he's certainly focused on getting better, as anyone who has Covid would want to do, he's being kept up to speed as appropriate by his leadership team and certainly that includes on the national security front," he said. (AFP)

    UK's Starmer pledges European reset at summit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Keir Starmer has conversations pencilled in with several European leaders, as he fleshes out what he wants the new relationship with the EU to look like. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762195_1_20240718235359.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday vowed to rebuild trust with European allies damaged by Brexit as he hosted dozens of leaders at a summit where they reaffirmed backing for Ukraine and pledged to tackle irregular migration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Starmer, premier for two weeks, told more than 45 European leaders the UK would be a "friend and partner" as he started work to improve ties hit by the country's tortuous departure from the European Union under his Conservative predecessors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to work with all of you to reset relationships, rediscover our common interest and renew the bonds of trust and friendship that brighten the fabric of European Life," the 61-year-old Labour leader told them as he opened the European Political Community (EPC) meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe is grappling with challenges ranging from supporting Kyiv after Russia's full-scale assault to breaking up people-smuggling gangs contributing to record levels of irregular migration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the background hangs the increasing possibility of Donald Trump regaining the White House in November, with fears over his commitment to the Western military alliance Nato.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's newly elected running mate JD Vance is an outspoken critic of military aid to Ukraine and has pushed for negotiations with Russia to end the two-year-plus war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important to be here, for Ukraine, especially this tough period, for us during the war," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at Blenheim Palace, near Oxford, west of London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us it's very important to maintain unity in Europe because always this unity leads to strong decisions," added Zelensky before discussions with Starmer and a meeting with head of state King Charles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While at the summit, the Ukrainian leader signed long-term security cooperation agreements with the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, attending an EPC summit for the first time, reaffirmed the alliance's support for Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a departure from the often fractious relations that characterised the run-up to Brexit, Starmer, who led Labour to a landslide election win over the Tories on July 4, told European counterparts that his government would be "a friend and a partner ready to work with you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called irregular migration a "crisis" affecting every country attending. More than 380,000 undocumented migrants crossed the EU's borders last year, and tens of thousands made their way to Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer called for a sharing of resources, intelligence and tactics to "shut down the smuggling routes and smash the gangs," behind migrant Channel crossings from northern France in small boats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a problem that dogged the Tory administrations under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cooperation was "the most efficient" way to tackle the problem, French President Emmanuel Macron said, the morning after one migrant died and 71 others were rescued off the French coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has conversations pencilled in with several European leaders, including Macron, as he fleshes out what he wants the new relationship with the EU to look like.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former human rights lawyer and chief state prosecutor supported Britain remaining in the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum and was once Labour's Brexit spokesman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has ruled out rejoining the European single market, customs union or freedom of movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he does want to negotiate a new security pact with the bloc and a veterinary agreement to ease border checks on agricultural foods, as well as an improved trading deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer was quick out of the blocks to congratulate Ursula von der Leyen on securing another term as European Commission president. He eagerly anticipated "working closely" with the EU chief, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish Premier Simon Harris described Labour's reset with Europe as a "gamechanger" while European Council chief Charles Michel said he hoped that a "new chapter" would be opened with the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One high-ranking EU official said there were "good vibes" in the early contacts with the new Labour government, but warned that the EU was not looking to "reopen" the Brexit deal with Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blenheim Palace is the birthplace of Britain's World War II leader Winston Churchill. The Treaty of London, which signed into existence the Council of Europe in 1949, was on display, adding further symbolism to the proceedings. (AFP)
