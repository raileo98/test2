<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea broke a century-old weather record with the 26th so-called tropical night in a row -- when the temperature stays above 25 degrees Celsius, according to official data released Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Much of the world is enduring a summer of extreme heat, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning last month of an "extreme heat epidemic", and calling for action to limit the impact of heatwaves intensified by climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight temperatures in the South Korean capital Seoul have sizzled above 25 degrees Celsius for 26 days in a row, officials said, marking the longest streak since modern weather observation began in 1907.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record ties a streak set in 2018, but the weather agency counts the most recent as the benchmark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The intense heat in Seoul is expected to continue, according to Seoul's Office of Metrology, setting a new record every day until next week. (AFP)

    Biden says he "beat Big Pharma" with drug price deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has negotiated down the prices of 10 top-selling prescription drugs used by Medicare by as much as 79 percent, hoping to save US$6 billion in the first year as part of a plan hailed on Thursday by President Biden with the aim to ease anger about high prices ahead of November elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, was the first to allow Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most costly drugs that the programme covers for 66 million people. The new prices will go into effect in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We finally beat Big Pharma," Biden said at an event in Largo, Maryland, alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration hopes the savings will ease Americans' anger about high prices, an issue they frequently say is their top concern headed into the closely contested November 5 presidential election between Harris and Republican former president Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs," Harris said. "Medicare can use that (collective bargaining) power to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new prices represent cuts to individual list prices that do not reflect any rebates and discounts the government may already be getting for the drugs, although the government's estimated savings from the negotiations do take those discounts into account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' tie-breaking Senate vote passed the law that allows for the drug-price negotiations, which no Republicans supported. In a statement, she also pointed to her work as California attorney general holding "big pharma accountable for their deceptive and illegal practices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration said people covered by Medicare, which mostly serves Americans aged 65 and over, would also save US$1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs for the prescription medicines in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merck & Co's diabetes drug Januvia faces the steepest percentage price cut of the drugs on the list, decreasing 79 percent, while Novo Nordisk's insulin aspart products will face the second steepest of 76 percent, according to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other eight drugs on the list face cuts of between 68 percent and 38 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Drugmakers voiced their opposition to the new discounts that they said would not necessarily lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and could hinder future innovation. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden confirmed its first case of the viral infection mpox on Thursday, which was also the first case outside Africa, a day after the WHO declared the disease a global public health emergency for the second time in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The person was infected while staying in a part of Africa where there was a large outbreak of the disease, Olivia Wigzell, director-general at the Swedish Public Health Agency, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organisation made its announcement over mpox, which spreads through close contact, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries of a more serious type of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I," Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed told the press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wigzell said the person who was infected had received care and instructions in line with the health agency's recommendations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The case is the first caused by Clade I that has been diagnosed outside the African continent. The affected person has also been infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox Clade I," she said. (Reuters)

    Five charged over death of 'Friends' actor Perry

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A floral tribute to Matthew Perry left by a fan in New York. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766362_2_20240816012519.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Criminal charges have been filed against five people in connection with the death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry nearly a year ago, law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defendants include two doctors and an assistant to Perry who were part of "a broad underground criminal network" that distributed large quantities of the prescription drug ketamine to the actor and others, US Attorney Martin Estrada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These defendants took advantage of Mr Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves," Estrada said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry died at age 54 from "acute effects" of ketamine, a powerful sedative, in addition to other factors that caused the actor to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub last October, an autopsy said. For months, Los Angeles homicide detectives and federal agents have been investigating how Perry obtained the prescription drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A December 2023 autopsy report concluded Perry died from the "acute effects of ketamine," which combined with other factors caused the actor to lose consciousness and slip below the water in the hot tub at his Los Angeles home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toxicology tests found Perry's body contained dangerously high levels of ketamine, a short-acting anaesthetic with hallucinogenic properties. Typically, people with that much ketamine in their systems are in general aesthesia during surgery, and being monitored by professionals, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other contributing factors in his death were drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of the opioid-addiction medicine buprenorphine, which was also detected in his system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry had publicly acknowledged decades of drug and alcohol abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends." He had been sober for 19 months with no known relapses before his death, according to interviews cited in his autopsy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witness interviews in the autopsy report said he had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. But his last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, so the ketamine found in his system by medical examiners would have been introduced since that last infusion, the autopsy said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s populist Pheu Thai party on Thursday nominated its party chief, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, in a Parliament vote for the country’s new leader after former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was removed by a court order over an ethical violation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn said she was ready to work for the country to move it forward and promised give her best, after securing her candidacy for prime minister by the governing alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined, together and will push the country forward," she told a press conference ahead of Friday's parliamentary vote on a new premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is seen as force behind Pheu Thai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the first Thai politician ever to win an overall majority of seats. The residual popularity of Thaksin is a factor in the support for Paetongtarn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Paetongtarn is approved by Parliament's vote she would become Thailand’s second female prime minister, and the country’s third leader from the Shinwatra family after her father and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan lifted on Thursday a week-old warning that a "megaquake", potentially causing colossal damage and loss of life could strike, with the government telling people their lives could now "go back to normal".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alert that such a catastrophe might hit the archipelago of 125 million people prompted thousands of Japanese to cancel holidays and stock up on essentials, emptying shelves in some stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since there were no abnormalities detected in seismic activity and crustal deformation, the special call for attention ended at 5pm," disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it doesn't mean the risk [of a major earthquake] has been eliminated," Matsumura told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been asking for special precautions, such as sleeping while being prepared to evacuate immediately. But we will no longer ask for these steps, and the people of Japan are free to go back to normal lifestyles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last Thursday, Japan's weather agency said the likelihood of a megaquake was "higher than normal" following a magnitude 7.1 jolt earlier in the day that injured 15 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was a particular kind of tremor known as a subduction megathrust quake, which in the past has occurred in pairs and can unleash massive tsunamis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advisory concerned the Nankai Trough between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 800-kilometre undersea gully runs parallel to Japan's Pacific coast, including off the Tokyo region, the world's biggest urban area and home to around 40 million people. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned, coming nearly four months after the Ivy League university was rocked by campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766252_1_20240815105933.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned Wednesday after a brief, tumultuous tenure that saw the head of the prestigious New York college grapple with protests over the Israel-Hamas war and criticism over how the school handled divisions related to the conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anti-war protests and encampments at Columbia and campuses across the United States were a flashpoint in debates about US support for Israel in its campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics said the protests at Columbia and elsewhere veered into anti-Semitism and intimidation, culminating in Shafik being questioned before the US Congress along with other university presidents and accused of not keeping Jewish students safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters -- many of whom were themselves Jewish -- said demonstrators' anti-Israel views were being conflated with anti-Semitism. They also said that individual allegations of hate incidents were being used to distract from calls for a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead," Shafik wrote in an email announcing the move, according to student newspaper the Columbia Spectator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am making this announcement now so that new leadership can be in place before the new term begins."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests and encampments spread across US universities, protesters at times occupied buildings. In some cases there were clashes with police, while at other times pro-Israel protesters attacked the encampments. (Agencies)

 The World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.

  Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determining a disease outbreak as a "public health emergency of international concern" or PHEIC – the WHO's highest level of alert – can accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and co-operation to contain a disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact. It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Africa's top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 17,000 suspected mpox cases and 517 deaths have been reported on the African continent so far this year, a 160 percent increase in cases compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said. A total of 13 countries have reported cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A different form of the mpox virus – clade IIb – spread globally in 2022, largely through sexual contact among men who have sex with men. This prompted the WHO to declare a public health emergency then, which it ended 10 months later. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult the Palestinian group afterwards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US has said it expects indirect talks to go ahead as planned in Qatar's capital Doha on Thursday, and that a ceasefire agreement was still possible, while warning that progress was needed urgently to avert a wider war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Axios reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed a trip to the Middle East that had been expected to begin on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three senior Iranian officials have said that only a ceasefire deal in Gaza would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel will send the negotiations team on the agreed upon date, that's tomorrow August 15th, in order to finalise the details of the implementation of the framework agreement," government spokesperson David Mencer said in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation includes Israel's spy chief David Barnea, head of the domestic security service Ronen Bar and the military's hostages chief Nitzan Alon, a defence official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has voiced scepticism about the chances of the talks delivering real results, blaming Israel for stalling, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been the main obstacle to sealing a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going to new negotiations allows the occupation to impose new conditions and employ the maze of negotiation to conduct more massacres," Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas' absence from the talks, however, does not eliminate the chances of progress since its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya is based in Doha and the group has open channels with Egypt and Qatar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hamas is committed to the proposal presented to it on July 2, which is based on the UN Security Council resolution and the Biden speech and the movement is prepared to immediately begin discussion over a mechanism to implement it," said Abu Zuhri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source familiar with the matter said that Hamas wants the mediators to come back to them with a "serious response" from Israel. If that happens, the group says, it will meet mediators after the Thursday session. (Reuters)

    Thai court forces PM out of office

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Thailand's Constitutional Court removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office on Wednesday as it ruled against him in an ethics case. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766160_1_20240814165201.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who served jail time, raising the spectre of more political upheaval and a reset of the governing alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I respect the verdict. I reiterate that for the almost one year I have been in this role, I have tried with good intentions to lead the country with honesty," Srettha told reporters outside his office after the court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real estate tycoon Srettha becomes the fourth Thai premier in 16 years to be removed by verdicts by the same court, after it ruled he violated the constitution by appointing a minister who did not meet ethical standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's removal after less than a year in power means parliament must convene to choose a new premier, with the prospect of more uncertainty in a country dogged for two decades by coups and court rulings that have brought down multiple governments and political parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same court last week dissolved the anti-establishment Move Forward Party, the hugely popular opposition, ruling its campaign to reform a law against insulting the crown risked undermining the constitutional monarchy. It regrouped on Friday under a new party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's Pheu Thai Party and its predecessors have borne the brunt of Thailand's turmoil, with two of its governments removed by coups in a long-running grudge match between the party's founders, the billionaire Shinawatra family, and their rivals in the conservative establishment and royalist military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision could rock a fragile truce between political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra and his enemies among the conservative elite and military old guard, which enabled the tycoon's return from 15 years of self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged attempt to bribe court staff, was above board. The bribery allegation was never proven and Pichit resigned in May.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kishida confirmed on Wednesday that he will not seek re-election as head of his party next month, meaning the end of his premiership. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766113_1_20240814112556.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday said he would not seek re-election as head of his party, meaning the end of his premiership after just under three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since 1945, is due to hold an internal leadership contest next month. Its popularity ratings have slumped because of rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this presidential election, it is necessary to show the people that the LDP is changing and the party is a new LDP," Kishida told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this, transparent and open elections and free and vigorous debate are important. The most obvious first step to show that the LDP will change is for me to step aside," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will not be running in the forthcoming presidential election."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida had informed senior administration officials of his intention not to run, media including national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo news reported earlier,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the ruling party is traditionally also prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida, 67, has been in office since October 2021, and has seen his and his party's poll ratings slide sharply in response to rising prices hitting Japanese incomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His cabinet's support rating has been languishing around 25 percent this year, according to an NHK poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's fourth-largest economy has also struggled to gain traction, with output shrinking 0.7 percent in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last November, Kishida announced a stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen (more than US$100 billion at the time) as he tried to ease the pressure from inflation and rescue his premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having seen prices barely move for years, Japanese voters have been reeling from rising prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, pushing up energy costs and putting pressure on the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some recovery in recent weeks, the yen has been one of the world's worst-performing currencies over the past year, falling sharply against the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While welcome news to Japanese exporters, this makes imports pricier and stokes inflation for households.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before November, the government had injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy over the past three years since the pandemic. (AFP)

    Banksy lifts curtain on London animal mural series

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The mural outside London Zoo is thought to be the last in the current series. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766068_1_20240814032242.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elusive street artist Banksy's ninth animal-themed mural in nine days, unveiled on Tuesday on a shutter outside London Zoo, depicted a gorilla releasing animals from the zoo, tying together the series of artworks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Claimed by the artist on Instagram, the mural outside London Zoo showed a gorilla lifting the shutter to free birds and a seal, with some animals staring out from the inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the latest in Banksy's series populating the British capital with animals, starting with a goat revealed last week on Monday, followed by two elephants the next day and then monkeys, a wolf, pelicans, a cat, piranhas and a rhinoceros in subsequent days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The frequency of artworks is unusual for Banksy – whose identity is publicly unknown – and who usually spaces out his pieces over months, leaving fans speculating about the meaning of the different animals and awaiting a "big" reveal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest mural was "an absolute shock and surprise to all of us here at London Zoo," Karl Penman, commercial operations manager at the zoo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If it is the full stop, what a great full stop to end on," Penman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC reported the that piece was the last in the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can see the watchful eyes, which to me look a little bit uncertain about whether they want to be free," said doctor Sharmela Darne about the eyes of animals staring from behind the shutter in the latest artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the seal's clearly going away and so are the birds flying free... so maybe it's about freedom and being unsure about freedom," said Darne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For many, the animal safari has added some positivity to their week, as the country reeled following the death of three girls in a stabbing and ensuing violent riots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in front of two pelicans painted over a fish shop in Walthamstow, northeast London, Peter McCarthy said it had been "very nice to have it in this particular week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Very nice that he's been around the country when there's been such trouble. Doing these wonderful things."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For others, the choice of animals has meaning, with some finding the goat similar to a Palestinian mountain gazelle and others pointing out the artist's previous work on the climate crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three of the artworks have already been removed or stolen, and the rhino revealed on Monday was defaced the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A satellite dish painted with the wolf was stolen within hours of being claimed by Banksy, with the cat on a billboard removed by contractors and a police box painted with swimming piranhas removed by the local authority to ensure it was "properly protected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in front of the cat on Saturday before it was removed, dentist Mitul Patel said he wished "people would leave his work alone so that other people could enjoy it as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locals and tourists alike have been enjoying the artworks that are still up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking a brief pause from his job, construction worker Owen said the three monkeys in east London's Shoreditch area were "very exciting" and a "big talking point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Mazur, a photographer visiting from the US, said he had been "running around photographing all" the artworks, and was "bummed" about having to return to New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retiree Don Gould lives around the corner from the goat in southwest London's Kew Green, and saw the artwork after it was revealed online last week. "It's a very good excuse for a stroll on the green and a pint, isn't it?" (AFP)

    US car workers union files charges against Trump, Musk

    <![CDATA[<img alt="During their live-streamed conversation on X, Donald Trump heaped praise on Elon Musk for his history of firing employees at the drop of a hat. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766067_1_20240814025737.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A major US car workers union filed federal labour charges on Tuesday against Donald Trump and Elon Musk, accusing the billionaires of illegally intimidating workers during a rambling and highly publicised conversation on X.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Republican presidential hopeful and Musk, who has endorsed him, exchanged a checklist of radical conspiracy theories as they chatted on the social network on Monday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one point the conversation veered into Musk's time at the helm of his multiple companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I mean, I look at what you do," Trump said to Musk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You walk in, you say, 'You want to quit?' They go on strike," Trump said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That's OK, you're all gone. You're all gone. So, every one of you is gone.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk carried out massive layoffs after his acquisition of Twitter (now X) was finalised in October 2022, and he announced in April the dismissal of more than 10 percent of Tesla's global workforce, amounting to at least 14,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labour Relations Act," said the United Auto Workers (UAW), which has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris after previously backing Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean. When we say Trump stands against everything our union stands for, this is what we mean," said UAW President Shawn Fain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both Trump and Musk want working class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly," Fain said. "It's disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk owns the social network X, SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, among other companies. He has been criticised in the past for obstructing the unionisation of his employees around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla has been at odds with unions in Sweden and Norway for a few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several complaints have also been filed in California by former SpaceX workers who say employees who tried to protest job conditions were retaliated against. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from several Muslim countries, as well as the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766064_1_20240814022139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A far-right Israeli minister prayed with thousands of Jews at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem on Tuesday, defying a ban on Jewish prayer at the flashpoint site and drawing global condemnation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government's longstanding ban, vowed to "defeat Hamas" in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The compound is Islam's third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity, but it is also Judaism's holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit comes at a tense time during the 10-month Israel-Hamas war, with faltering efforts for a ceasefire and Israel braced for threatened attacks from Iran and its proxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers, including the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not only is it unacceptable, it detracts from what we think is a vital time, as we are working to get this ceasefire deal across the finish line," US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years, the restrictions have been increasingly flouted by hardline religious nationalists like Ben Gvir, prompting sometimes violent reactions from Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday morning, he and some 2,250 other Israelis walked through the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns, under the protection of Israeli police, said an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is custodian of the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli police also "imposed restrictions" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said, adding that more than 700 Jews also prayed there in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque, is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa Mosque," the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry condemned the "storming" of the mosque, calling it a "flagrant violation of international law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The continual violations of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities require a clear and firm international position that condemns these violations," ministry spokesperson Sufyan al-Qudah said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group of Muslim-majority states, "strongly condemned" the incident and said it was a "provocation to the feelings of Muslims all over the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the UN was "against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This sort of behaviour is unhelpful and it is unduly provocative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on X that the bloc "strongly condemns the provocations" by Ben Gvir.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images posted on social media networks showed Ben Gvir inside the compound while several Israelis lay on the ground performing Talmudic rituals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir released a video statement on X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, renewing his opposition to any truce in the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo," he said, referring to the US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza set to resume on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can defeat Hamas... we must bring them down to their knees," Ben Gvir said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's entry into the Al-Aqsa compound comes on the Jewish mourning day of Tisha Be'Av that commemorates the destruction of the ancient temple.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man appeared in a London court on Tuesday charged with attempted murder after an 11-year-old girl was stabbed in one of the capital's busiest tourist areas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ioan Pintaru, 32, appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court, which heard that he was a Romanian citizen with no fixed address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The girl was with her mother when she was attacked in Leicester Square on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said Pintaru had "approached the girl, placed her into a headlock, he's then stabbed her eight times to the body."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was taken to hospital with serious but not life threatening injuries. She was wounded in the face, shoulder, wrist and neck area, the prosecutor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have said they do not believe that the suspect knew the girl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pintaru was remanded in custody to appear in court again on September 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack outside top brand stores in the central London square came two weeks after a mass stabbing in Southport, northwest England, in which three girls were killed and eight children and two adults wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack sparked riots across England, after rumours spread online that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in India on Tuesday said hospital services were disrupted in several Indian cities after a doctors' protest spread nationwide following the rape and murder of a trainee medic in the city of Kolkata.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of doctors marched on Monday in Kolkata and the surrounding West Bengal state to denounce the killing at a government-run hospital, demanding justice for the victim and better security measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old doctor was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests spread on Tuesday, with more than 8,000 government doctors in the western Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, halting work in all hospital departments except emergency services, media said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the capital, New Delhi, junior doctors wearing white coats held posters that read, "Doctors are not punching bags," as they sat in protest outside a large government hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar protests in cities such as Lucknow, capital of the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, and in the western tourist resort state of Goa hit some hospital services, media said. (Reuters)

    Africa health body warns over mpox spread

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The African Union's health watchdog on Tuesday declared a public health emergency over the growing mpox outbreak on the continent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766050_1_20240813221254.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Africa's top public health body declared what it termed a "public health emergency of continental security" on Tuesday over an outbreak of mpox that spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighbouring countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I declare with a heavy heart but with an unyielding commitment to our people, to our African citizens, we declare mpox as public health emergency of continental security," Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said during an online media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox is transmitted through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. Most cases are mild but it can kill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as Clade I.
  <br/>
  But the new variant, known as Clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, particularly among children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Africa CDC warned last week the viral infection's rate of spread was alarming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that more than 15,000 mpox cases and 461 deaths were reported on the continent this year so far, representing a 160 percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades after it was first detected in human in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A milder version of the virus spread to over 100 countries in 2022, largely through sexual contact, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO ended the emergency 10 months later, saying the health crisis had come under control. (Reuters)

    Hong Kong dessert chain rides the French wave

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Xu Xiaofeng, the owner of the Paris Hui Lau Shan business, prepares the shop's signature mango drink. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765966_1_20240813105944.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A nostalgic Hong Kong mango sago chain is thriving in one of the most unexpected places – Paris, showing that sweet treats can transcend boundaries, cultures and languages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui Lau Shan – a household name for classic Chinese desserts and herbal tea, and famous for its icy mango beverages and desserts – had been a fixture on the streets of Hong Kong since the 1960s, until the last franchised store in the SAR closed in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it is flourishing in the French capital because of a die-hard fan. Xu Xiaofeng brought the franchise to Paris after he developed a love affair with its fruity drinks when he was extremely thirsty one day during a Hong Kong work trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But becoming the owner of the Parisian Hui Lau Shan business was not easy. Xu said it took him three tries to convince the owners to grant him permission to expand the brand in France, where Xu had been an exchange student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the conditions was that he needed to stay true to Hui Lau Shan’s original taste, with the owners sending inspectors to ensure that the taste of the Paris branch matched that of the original back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Europe, people really love eating mangos,” a beaming Xu, wearing an apron and a red baseball cap emblazoned with the brand's logo told RTHK, as he prepared a signature drink by cutting up the fruit and putting it into a food blender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Basically, if there are more than ten tonnes of mangoes a year, Paris would consume more than half of them, so I know there is a good market here,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “First, they love mangoes very much, and second, many strive for healthy foods, so it was the perfect combination.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu said his dessert shops first attracted Chinese customers living in France, but over time, he also won over the French, who he said did have one complaint – that his desserts were not sweet enough compared to local pastries and tarts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To address this, Xu decided to start blending elements from both cultures to bring the two culinary worlds together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think this is an exchange between desserts. For example, our pancakes use French cheese, cream and French Chantilly. This is a good blend. Now, French people are slowly starting to use a lot of fresh fruits to make their own desserts, which I think is a good exchange,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are able to learn from each other. Our desserts aren’t too sweet, but theirs are. With exchange, we can meet in the middle and create something new together.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 The armed wing of Palestinian group Hamas said on Monday its militants had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others, both women, in two separate incidents in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages during their October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, with 111 of them still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement: "In two separate incidents, two recruits assigned to guard enemy prisoners fired at a Zionist prisoner, killing him immediately, and also injured two female prisoners critically."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement, posted on Telegram, did not identify the hostages or say when or where the incidents occurred, but noted "attempts are being made to save the lives" of the two women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Obeida said Hamas had formed a committee to investigate the shootings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that it does "not have any intelligence information that allows us to refute or confirm Hamas' claims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to examine and verify the credibility of the message," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, in a televised briefing earlier on Monday, said: "We do not forget for a moment the hostages being cruelly held by Hamas in Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are deeply concerned about their physical and mental condition, given the prolonged time that has passed and the harsh conditions of their captivity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in the Gaza Strip since then has killed at least 39,897 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukrainian troops who have crossed the border into its territory will be "dislodged." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765928_1_20240813023744.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his army on Monday to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops who have entered Russian territory as authorities said over 120,000 people had been evacuated away from the fighting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Russia's western Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's military chief Oleksandr Syrsky told President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video posted on Monday that his troops now control about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory and are continuing "offensive operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin told a televised meeting with government officials that "one of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord" and "destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky told the nation in his evening address that the cross-border offensive was "purely a security issue," capturing "areas from which the Russia army struck at our Sumy region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 121,000 people have fled the Kursk region since the start of the fighting, which has killed at least 12 civilians and injured 121 more, regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the meeting with Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Kursk announced on Monday they were widening their evacuation area to include a district with some 14,000 residents. The neighbouring Belgorod region also said it was evacuating a new border district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has pierced into the region by at least 12 kilometres and has captured 28 towns and villages, with the new front 40 kilometres long, Smirnov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Syrsky said that "as of now, about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory are under control," suggesting the area captured is more than twice as large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that fighting was ongoing along almost the whole front and "the situation is under our control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said Russia would respond by showing "unanimous support for all those in distress" and claimed there had been an increase in men signing up to fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enemy will receive a worthy riposte," he said. (AFP)

    Indonesia president holds meeting in future capital

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Monday held his first cabinet meeting in the country's future capital, despite much of the city remaining under construction as it runs behind schedule.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US$32-billion megaproject Nusantara was widely expected to be inaugurated on August 17, Indonesia's Independence Day, but building delays and funding woes have cast doubt on the schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, still hailed the city-in-progress, which is expected to be fully ready in 2045.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not all countries have the opportunity, have the ability to build their capital starting from zero," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Jokowi, the city is "being built with the concept of a forest city, a jungle city, a city full of green" in eastern Borneo island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But environmentalists have warned the rapid development of the new capital will hasten deforestation in one of the world's largest stretches of tropical rainforest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokowi – who started to work from the future capital several weeks ago – brought dozens of officials to Nusantara for the cabinet meeting, including his successor Prabowo Subianto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo pledged to continue the capital-to-be once he takes office in October, removing any doubt over his willingness to carry out Jokowi's legacy project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokowi resurrected the long-shelved plan to relocate the capital soon after taking office in 2019 after experts warned Jakarta – the megacity of 12 million people – was sinking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An official decree on moving the capital from Jakarta could be delayed until after Prabowo takes office, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have said many times that I am determined to continue, if possible, to complete the project," said Prabowo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe in three, four, five years, the capital city can function."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ground broke on several projects on Monday, including the vice presidential palace and several private buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nusantara has struggled to attract crucial foreign investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jakarta will fund 20 percent of Nusantara and hopes to secure 100 trillion rupiah (US$6.13 billion) in private investment by the end of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as of Monday, Jokowi said it had received only 56.2 trillion rupiah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government aims to have 1.9 million people living in Nusantara by 2045. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive wildfire blazed its way into Athens' northeastern suburbs on Monday as hundreds of firefighters battled to contain it, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes and sparking a Greek government appeal for international help.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In scenes never before seen in the Greek capital, residents wearing masks against the choking smoke were desperately dousing their homes with water hoses in the leafy suburbs of Nea Penteli and Vrilissia in an effort to render them less vulnerable to fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television footage showed several cars in both areas gutted by fire and the roofs of stately homes burning as water-bombing helicopters roared overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation is dramatic," Penteli mayor Natassa Kosmopoulou told news portal newsit.gr.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A school and homes are on fire, and I can see the fire coming towards the town hall," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece on Monday formally called for EU assistance, a spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU civil protection mechanism was activated upon request of the Greek authorities," EU spokesman Balazs Ujvari said in a statement, adding that Italy, France, the Czech Republic and Romania were sending units to help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Paris was sending 180 firefighters, 55 trucks and a helicopter to assist their hard-pressed Greek colleagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wildfire started on Sunday afternoon in the town of Varnavas, some 35 kilometres northeast of Athens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aided by strong winds, it grew to a 30-kilometre long frontline of fires, more than 25 metres high in places, according to state TV ERT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 700 firefighters with 190 fire engines and over 30 aircraft sought to contain it, but it scaled Mount Pentelicon, which looms over the Greek capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several large Athens municipalities ordered partial evacuations, including Penteli, Vrilissia and Halandri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of the direction of the wind we have decided on a precautionary evacuation," Halandri mayor Simos Roussos told ERT. "The fire is very close."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities opened the Olympic stadium in northern Athens and other stadiums to house thousands of people evacuated from the path of the blaze. Three major hospitals have been placed on standby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One firefighter suffered serious burns, another was hospitalised with breathing trouble and 13 other people were treated for milder respiratory problems, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several smaller communities and towns, including Marathon, which gave the Olympic long distance race its name, started to evacuate on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are facing a biblical catastrophe," said Marathon's mayor Stergios Tsirkas. "Our whole town is engulfed in flames," he told the Skai television channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon, which is known for producing the marble used in the Acropolis and other ancient buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly," Vathrakogiannis said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wind had rekindled the fire in 40 different locations on Monday, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A children's hospital and a military medical facility in Penteli were evacuated at dawn, Vathrakogiannis said. Another hospital was evacuated during the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The destruction revived memories of the Mati disaster, the coastal area near Marathon where 104 people died in July 2018 in a tragedy later blamed on evacuation delays and errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summer wildfire season in Greece this year has seen dozens of daily blazes after the Mediterranean country recorded its warmest winter and the hottest June and July since reliable data collection began in 1960.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures around Athens were forecast to peak at 39 degrees Celsius on Monday, with wind gusts of up to 50 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Forest fire near you. Follow the instructions of the authorities," said SMS messages sent to people in the Attica region, indicating in which direction to flee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias issued a warning on Saturday that half the country faced a high risk of fires due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday he said that a fire that broke out on Sunday near the town of Varnavas had spread even though a water-bombing aircraft reached the area within five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working 24-hour shifts, all of us," said fireman Marinos Peristeropoulos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fire spread very quickly because of the strong wind," he said near one of the hotspots in Grammatiko.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other parts of Europe are also struggling with high temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of France rose above 40 Celsius on Sunday. In Rome, temperatures were expected to reach 38 Celsius Monday and remain around 36 Celsius this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, temperatures between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius are expected. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday urged all sides in the Ukraine war to de-escalate as Kyiv's forces pierced deep into Russia's Kursk border region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault seemed to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army on Sunday appearing to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the offensive, Beijing on Monday urged all parties to follow "three principles for de-escalating the situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those are "no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fuelling the flame by any party", the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China will continue to maintain communication with the international community and play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the crisis," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing released a paper last year calling for a political settlement to the conflict. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Just opposite the fencing stadium, the Grand Palais on the Avenue des Champs Élysées, scores of tourists have been queuing up outside the largest Olympic merchandise store to take home a taste of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paris 2024 megastore offers a variety of souvenirs, from 5 euro pens and bracelets, to giant mascots costing 800 euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekday visitors have had to wait around 15 minutes to get inside the store, but most RTHK spoke to said it was worth queuing up for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adam, a UK tourist in Paris with his kids, bought a T-shirt, a hat, a poster and some badges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We spent about 110 euros, which I think, as it's only every four years, it's something to remember the Games by, so I think it's okay every once in a while,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic mascot “Phryge”, a little red hat symbolising French liberty, is one of the bestsellers at the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas from Hong Kong bought one because he wanted something special to take home with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s unique and it's like representing the culture and France and also it represents the spirit of the Olympics, so we're trying to look for something very unique for a gift,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to the French capital can also take home the smell of a fresh baguette, with the launch of scratch-and-sniff stamps by the French postal service La Poste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's to celebrate the baguette, which is one of the symbols of France for the tourists for them to enjoy and to share this with the people they live with abroad,” said Gaspard, a worker at the Olympic Village’s post office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French baguette was given Unesco heritage status in 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris said a triumphant "au revoir" to the Olympics on Sunday as the curtain came down on its widely praised staging of the global sporting spectacular.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A star-studded closing ceremony took place in front of around 71,500 spectators at the Stade de France to crown an event that has been broadly acclaimed as one of the greatest editions of the Olympics ever held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 270 artists performed in the packed arena for an estimated 9,000 athletes who marched into the venue as the festivities got into full swing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening segment of the ceremony festivities began with France's swimming hero Leon Marchand -- winner of four gold medals at these Games -- gathering the Olympic flame from the cauldron in the centre of Paris to begin its journey to the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rugby hero Antoine Dupont -- who led the host nation to a rugby sevens gold medal in one of the early highlights of the Games -- carried a tricolore flag into the Stade de France as partying athletes swarmed the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show included a theatrical sequence entitled "Records", which was a dream-like immersive journey through time, led by a "Golden Voyager".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musicians Phoenix then entertained the crowd with a series of hits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach hailed the Paris Games as "sensational".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish - or dare I say, Seine-sational Games," Bach said in a speech at the closing ceremony, in a reference to the river which staged the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the Los Angeles Olympics, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed to the Californian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then it was time for Hollywood's top gun Tom Cruise to jump from the roof of the Stade de France into the closing ceremony before speeding off with the Olympic flag in a dramatic handover that began the anticipation for the Games in 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A beaming Cruise high-fived athletes after making the roughly 160-foot descent before jumping on a motorcycle and exiting the stadium as the crowd at the 80,000-seat stadium roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Living up to the stunning success of the Paris Games may seem like mission impossible for LA and the celebrity-rich city will lean on its stars such as leading man Cruise as the Olympic spotlight turns to Southern California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise was among the many celebrities seen taking in the action at the Paris Games, showing up at gymnastics, swimming and soccer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, Yseult, a French R&B singer, performed "Comme d’habitude," the song famously adapted into "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nineteen people including five children are confirmed dead after a landslide at a huge garbage dump in the Ugandan capital Kampala, a senior official said on Sunday, amid claims the site was a disaster waiting to happen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local media said homes, people and livestock were buried in mountains of waste at the landfill in the northern Kampala district of Kiteezi on Saturday after a collapse caused by heavy downpours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Yoweri Museveni said he had directed the army's special forces to help in the search and rescue operation and demanded to know who allowed people to live near such a "potentially hazardous and dangerous heap."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area's resident commissioner Yasin Ndide said after visiting the scene of the disaster that the death toll was now 19, including five children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rescue mission is ongoing but with little hope of finding more survivors," he said, adding that local authorities were setting up temporary shelters for those affected by the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndide blamed the "encroachment" of local people who had breached the perimeter fence and settled on the site for the loss of life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala's metropolitan police spokesman Patrick Onyango had earlier told reporters at the scene that 14 bodies had been recovered on Saturday, and another four on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Onyango also said that 14 people had been rescued, while an estimated 1,000 were displaced and that the police were working with other government agencies and community leaders to see how to help those affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala mayor Erias Lukwago said that "many, many more could be still buried in the heap as the rescue operation is ongoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described it as a "national disaster," blaming corrupt officials who he said had been syphoning off money that should have been used to maintain the landfill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Museveni said in a statement posted on X that he had ordered payments to the victims' families of five million Ugandan shillings (US$1,300) for each fatality and one million shillings (US$270) for each injured person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for an investigation into how people were allowed to live so close to the site and ordered the removal of all those living in the "danger zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excavators were still churning through huge mounds of rubbish on Sunday as crowds of local residents looked on, some wailing in despair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukwago had on Saturday raised concerns about the safety of the 36-acre (14-hectare) landfill which was established in 1996 and takes in almost all garbage collected across Kampala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a disaster and was bound to happen as the landfill was full to capacity," he said, adding that it received about 1,500 tonnes of waste a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, Lukwago had warned that people working and living near the site were at risk of numerous health hazards due to overflowing waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several areas in Uganda and other parts of East Africa have been battered by heavy rains recently, including Ethiopia, the second most populous country on the continent. (AFP)

    Hamas tells Gaza mediators to go with Biden truce plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People inspect the damage in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood after it was destroyed by Israeli bombs on Sunday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765795_1_20240812034601.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday called on US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators to implement a ceasefire plan for Gaza put forward by US President Joe Biden, instead of holding "more negotiations."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas "demands that the mediators present a plan to implement what they proposed to the movement... based on Biden's vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and compel the occupation (Israel) to comply, rather than going through more negotiation rounds or new proposals," the Palestinian group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators have invited both Israel and Hamas for a round of negotiations on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, shortly after the killing of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Israel agreed to a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks to facilitate the release of hostages still held in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the killing of Haniyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several rounds of negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza have failed until now, except for a one-week truce that was observed at the end of November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That truce saw the release of scores of hostages in exchange of dozens of Palestinians prisoners who were held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On May 31, Biden unveiled what he said was a three-stage plan for a ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plan includes a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks, with Israeli forces withdrawing from "all populated areas of Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "a number" of hostages captured in the October 7 attacks, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The remains of some hostages who had been killed would also be returned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their "homes and neighbourhoods" throughout Gaza, including in the north, which has been devastated by months of Israeli bombing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the initial six-week period, Israel and Hamas would "negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceasefire would also be extended if the negotiations continue, with mediators working to ensure they continue, Biden said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In phase two, also lasting around another six weeks, Israeli forces would completely withdraw from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "all remaining living hostages" including male Israeli soldiers. This has been a key sticking point for Hamas in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If both sides keep to the deal it will lead to the "cessation of hostilities permanently," Biden said, quoting what he said had been an Israeli proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the third and final stage, a major reconstruction and stabilisation plan for Gaza would begin, backed by the US and the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 Hamas attacks resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,790 people, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday acknowledged Ukrainian forces had pierced deep into the Kursk border region in an offensive that a top official in Ukraine said was aimed to "destabilise" Russia and "stretch" its armed forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border," the security official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock assault, now in its sixth day, appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army rushing in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash the incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But its army on Sunday appeared to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a daily briefing on the situation in the western Kursk region, the defence ministry said it had "foiled attempts" by Ukraine's forces to "break through deep into Russian territory" using armoured vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said some of those forces were located near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian official also said Russia's claims that Kyiv had deployed 1,000 troops were a serious underestimation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a lot more... Thousands," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After days of official silence, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the offensive for the first time in his nightly address on Saturday, saying that Kyiv was "pushing the war into the aggressor's territory."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022 and has waged an unrelenting campaign, occupying swathes of the east and south and subjecting Ukrainian cities to daily missile and drone attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After re-capturing large areas in 2022, Kyiv has largely been on the back foot, increasingly struggling with manpower and arms supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault on Russia's western Kursk region has been the largest and most successful cross-border offensive by Kyiv so far – and the most significant attack by a foreign army on Russian territory since the Second World War.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has used air power, artillery fire and drones in a bid to quash the advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said on Saturday that more than 76,000 civilians had been evacuated from border areas, with more leaving on Sunday. (AFP)

    Two migrants die trying to cross Channel to Britain

    <![CDATA[<img alt="So far this year 25 migrants have died trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765786_1_20240812001833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new drownings near the French city of Calais mean nine people have lost their life attempting the dangerous sea crossing this month alone, and 25 since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boat was signalled as being in distress on Sunday morning at sea between Calais and Dunkirk and "two people were declared dead," the maritime authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel in trouble 10 kilometres north of Calais had 56 migrants on board, said Jacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the 54 surviving passengers, and another 50 people from another boat who were rescued, five were receiving medical care, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, 12 migrants had died at sea trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain, according to the French authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death toll this year has already surpassed that, with 25 migrants who have lost their lives since January, Billant said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said those crossing the sea often did so "without a lifejacket," on "vessels of very poor quality because not inflated enough and often without a solid bottom... or decent engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-governmental organisation called L'Auberge des Migrants ("The migrant hostel") on X mourned the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This border kills in the greatest of silences," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of August 8, 17,639 people had crossed the sea on so-called "small boats" to Britain this year, according to a tally of British government figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That is very close to the figure for the same period in 2022, a year of record crossings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Labour party's victory in the British general election in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has cancelled a plan by the former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to crack down on the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Billant said more than 350 people have been arrested and 15 "smuggler networks" dismantled since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new migrant deaths come as the United Kingdom has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the United Kingdom on Saturday against the riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration. (AFP)

    In TV interview, Biden brands Trump a 'danger' to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden made the claim in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765781_1_20240811234132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since dropping out of the White House race, warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Mark my words, if he wins... this election, watch what happens," Biden told CBS News in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's a genuine danger to American security. Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since withdrawing after his flailing debate performance against Trump underlined fears about his age and mental abilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week, he appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining his exit, he said other Democratic Party politicians standing for re-election feared he would damage their chances – and added that his only priority was to stop Trump from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A critical issue for me still is – not a joke – maintaining this democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is – we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery – and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's age had come to dominate the 2024 campaign, and the Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since his exit, as Harris has enjoyed a surge in support that has left Trump struggling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to stay on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth, but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's light campaign schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, JD Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about white supremacist attacks on his family, child care, asylum seekers and abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash. (AFP)

    Australian government urged to ban gambling ads

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs. Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765725_1_20240811154222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An alliance of leading Australians has demanded the government impose a total ban on gambling ads in a country that racks up some of the biggest losses per person in the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gambling losses in Australia, with a population of just 27 million, are estimated at A$25 billion a year (US$16 billion).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adverts enticing people to risk their cash are widespread on television, radio and billboards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs, too, drawing more to part with their money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Gambling advertising in Australia is out of control with one million gambling ads being aired on free-to-air television and radio in just one year," said a letter signed by more than 60 prominent Australians to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the opposition leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the letter released at the weekend included former political, union, sports and faith leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Albanese's Labor government and the conservative opposition to agree to outlaw all gambling advertising within three years, in line with the recommendations of a 2023 report into gambling harm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many Australians are alarmed about the proliferation of gambling advertising on our screens and the mounting losses through gambling," said former prime minister John Howard, who was among the signatories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe gambling losses are responsible for enormous harm throughout the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Studies cited by the government put Australian gambling losses at A$25 billion a year, representing a global record per capita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even during a period of Covid-19 measures that closed many pubs, clubs and casinos in the 2020-2021 financial year, Australian state government statistics showed gambling losses exceeded A$24 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total ban on all gambling advertising is essential to stop gambling companies targeting our children," said Alliance for Gambling Reform chief executive Martin Thomas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any decision to simply cap advertising, or limit a blanket ban to only social media, would be a win for vested interests and leave Australians exposed to significant harm," Thomas said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the financial losses, the cost of inaction would be "mounting financial ruin, mental health problems, suicide, and the family violence that gambling can exacerbate", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Nine Entertainment newspapers have said the government is expected to announce proposed legislation within weeks, possibly opting for limits instead of a total advertising ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said last week his government had engaged with "stakeholders" and was committed to "minimising gambling harm" but declined to say whether an advertising ban was envisaged. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Indian soldiers were killed in clashes in Kashmir, the military said early on Sunday, after security forces exchanged fire with militants in the disputed territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kashmir, particularly its southern Hindu-majority region Jammu, has seen a string of battles with insurgents in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army wrote on social media that two soldiers had "laid down their lives in the line of duty" in Anantnag district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army and police had clashed with militants after launching an operation in the area, according to a social media post by the local military unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinar Corps said on X that two civilians were also injured "due to indiscriminate, desperate and reckless firing by terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muslim-majority Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, and each side claims it in full.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebel groups have waged an insurgency since 1989, demanding independence or merger with Pakistan, in fighting that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, soldiers and rebels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi and Islamabad accuse each other of stoking militancy and espionage to undermine each other, and the nuclear-armed rivals have fought multiple conflicts for control of the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, at least 11 Indian soldiers were killed in Kashmir following a spate of militant attacks. (AFP)

    New polls give Harris a lead over Trump in key states

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Voters polled in Pennsylvania said they saw Kamala Harris as more intelligent than Donald Trump and having a better temperament to govern. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765677_1_20240811002507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in three crucial battleground states, according to new polls published on Saturday, apparently eroding the advantage the former president has enjoyed there over the past year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The polls of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College showed Harris leading Trump by an identical 50 percent to 46 percent margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the US electoral college voting system, those three populous Midwestern states are considered key to victory for either party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The polls are a reversal of surveys in those states which for nearly a year had shown Trump either tied with or slightly leading Democratic President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed Harris instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much can change in the nearly three months before the November 5 election. The polling showed voters still prefer Trump on the key issues of the economy and immigration, though Harris had a 24-point advantage when voters were asked whom they trust on the issue of abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democrats, in any case, have taken heart in the surge of enthusiasm that has greeted Harris's candidacy, with many expressing relief after 81-year-old Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her announcement on Tuesday of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate also appears to have energised Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris-Walz surge helped cut short a rise in support for Trump that followed the July 13 attempt on his life and the Republicans' successful national convention last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Harris has enjoyed an even bigger bump in favourability – up 10 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania in just a month, the Times/Siena polling found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voters said they saw her as more intelligent than Trump and having a better temperament to govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, his running mate JD Vance and other Republicans have tried an array of attacks meant to weaken Harris – with Trump even questioning her racial identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the new polls show Democrats strongly supporting the younger and more vigorous Harris who, with Walz, has been campaigning at a furious pace this week in swing states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among Democrats, voter satisfaction with their choice of candidates has shot up by 27 points in the three Midwestern states since May, the polls found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three months ago, it was Republicans who expressed a higher level of satisfaction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surveys were conducted between August 5 and 9, with at least 600 voters in each state. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the UK on Saturday to protest recent rioting blamed on the far-right in the wake of the Southport knife attack that killed three children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Crowds massed in London, Glasgow, Belfast, Manchester and numerous other English towns and cities, as fears of violent confrontations with anti-immigration agitators failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It followed a similar situation unfolding on Wednesday night, when anticipated far-right rallies up and down the country were instead replaced by gatherings organised by the Stand Up To Racism advocacy group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen places across England as well as Belfast had been hit by unrest prior to that, following the July 29 stabbing spree, which was wrongly linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioters targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration, as well as police, vehicles and other sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, recent nights have been largely peaceful in English towns and cities, prompting hope among authorities that the more than 700 arrests and numerous people already being jailed has deterred further violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, in Northern Ireland, which has seen sustained disorder since last weekend, police said they were investigating a suspected racially motivated hate crime overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A petrol bomb was thrown at a mosque in Newtownards, east of Belfast, in the early hours of Saturday, with graffiti sprayed on the front door and walls of the building, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the petrol bomb thrown at the property did not ignite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is being treated as a racially motivated hate crime, and I want to send a strong message to those who carried this out, that this type of activity will not be tolerated and any reports of hate crime are taken very seriously," PSNI Chief Inspector Keith Hutchinson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was also overnight reports of damage to property and vehicles in Belfast, as nightly unrest there rumbled on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disturbances in Northern Ireland were sparked by events in England but have also been fuelled by pro-UK loyalist paramilitaries with their own agenda, according to the PSNI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 5,000 anti-racism demonstrators rallied in Belfast on Saturday without incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In London, hundreds massed outside the office of Brexit architect Nigel Farage's Reform UK party before marching to parliament, as a large police presence looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage and other far-right figures have been blamed for helping to fuel the riots through anti-immigrant rhetoric and conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really important for people of colour in this country, for immigrants in this country, to see us out here as white British people saying 'no, we don't stand for this'," said attendee Phoebe Sewell, 32, from London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow Londoner Jeremy Snelling, 64, said he had turned out because "I don't like the right-wing claiming the streets in my name."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not hold Farage "personally responsible" for the violence but argued that the Reform party founder had "contributed" to the volatile environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think he is damaging and I think he's dangerous," Snelling added. (AFP)

    LA planning 'No Car' Olympics to beat gridlock

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles 2028 organisers said on Saturday they will force spectators to take public transportation to Olympic venues and encourage remote working in a bid to sidestep the gridlocked city's notorious traffic problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said 2028 chiefs want the LA Olympics to be "The No Car Games" by investing in public transportation and encouraging Angelenos to adopt pandemic-style remote-working for the duration of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'No Car Games' means that you will have to take public transportation to get to all of the venues," Bass told a press conference ahead of Sunday's Paris Olympics closing ceremony. "In order to do that we have been building out our transportation system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan would require borrowing more than 3,000 buses from other parts of the United States, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass was adamant however that Los Angeles's traffic, where rush hour congestion can lead to car journeys of just a few miles taking an hour or more, would not be a problem, citing the history of the 1984 Olympics in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 1984 Angelenos were terrified that we were going to have terrible, terrible traffic," she said. "And we were shocked that we didn't. And in 1984 we didn't have any of the technology that we do today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that city officials 40 years ago encouraged employers to stagger shifts or allowed workers to work remotely to great success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we can do that again," Bass said. "So part of having a no-car Olympics means getting people not to drive, but also using public transportation to get to the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We certainly learned from Covid that you have essential workers, people that must come to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if you limit it to that, it's going to be a lot easier because we did go through Covid. So people will have some reference point in recent history as to how you can do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass said the city would also aim to house Los Angeles's estimated 75,500 homeless population before the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if Los Angeles would follow Paris' example by moving several thousand homeless people in the build-up to the Olympics to locations outside the city, Bass replied: "We are going to get Angelenos housed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is what we have been doing and we're going to continue to do that. We will get people housed, we will get them off the street." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopian Tamirat Tola delivered a masterclass in solo front running to win the Olympic men's marathon in Paris on Saturday as Eliud Kipchoge's bid for a third gold went up in smoke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tola clocked an Olympic record of two hours  six minutes and 26 seconds for victory, finishing 21 seconds ahead of Belgium's Bashir Abdi, whose silver marked an upgrade from his bronze garnered at the Covid-hit Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Benson Kipruto, winner of Tokyo, Boston and Chicago marathons in recent years, rounded out the podium, a further 13 seconds adrift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you, Paris!" said Tola, the 2016 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist who will be 33 on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy today, I was 2022 world champion and now I'm Olympic champion. It's the greatest day in my life. This was my goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team fielded three long-distance runners in the event, with Wu Xiangdong finishing 40th with a time of two hours, 12 minutes and 34 seconds. Yang Shaohui came in 55th with a time of two hours, 14 minutes and 48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s third runner, He Jie, needed two hours 22 minutes and 31 seconds to finish the race, finishing 67th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km-long marathon course headed out of central Paris on a loop to Versailles.
  <br/>
  The route included a 436m climb and 438m descent. The maximum gradient on the route was 13.5 percent. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Gaza civil defence says 93 dead in Israeli strike

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Displaced Palestinians gather in the yard of a school hit by an Israeli strike in Gaza City. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765635_1_20240810170902.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced Palestinians killed 93 people, as Israel's military accused militants of using the building as a command centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas denounced the "dangerous escalation" in north Gaza, which came after international mediators invited the warring sides to resume next Thursday talks towards a long-sought ceasefire and hostage-release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry said the timing of the school strike "is an indication of the Israeli government's efforts to obstruct and thwart these efforts".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence in the Hamas-ruled territory said three Israeli missiles hit the school in Gaza City while people performed dawn prayers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their bodies were torn apart," civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. "It reminds us of the first days of the war in the Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced during the war started by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings, which have been hit at least 14 times since July 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army said on Saturday it had "precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the Al-Tabieen school".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has repeatedly made similar accusations after strikes on the school shelters. Hamas has previously denied Israeli claims that it uses schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities for military aims. (AFP)

    Regional plane crashes in Brazil killing 61

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The plane crashed in the town of Vinhedo, near Sao Paulo. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765594_1_20240810084017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A regional turboprop plane crashed near Sao Paulo in Brazil on Friday, killing all 61 people on board, the airline said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Regional carrier Voepass said the plane, bound for Sao Paulo's international airport, took off from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed at around 1.30 pm in the town of Vinhedo, some 80 km northwest of Sao Paulo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video shared on social media showed the ATR-72 aircraft spinning out of control as it plunged down behind a cluster of trees near houses, followed by a large plume of black smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearby resident Daniel de Lima said he heard a loud noise before looking outside his condominium in Vinhedo when he saw the plane in a horizontal spiral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was rotating, but it wasn't moving forward," he told Reuters. "Soon after it fell out of the sky and exploded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City officials at Valinhos, near Vinhedo, said there were no survivors and only one home in the local condominium complex had been damaged while none of the residents were hurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I almost believe the pilot tried to avoid a nearby neighbourhood, which is densely populated," de Lima said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not immediately say what had caused the crash, though the head of Brazilian aviation accident investigation centre Cenipa said that the plane's so-called "black box" containing voice recordings and flight data had been recovered from the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video of the crash showed clear weather, with the forecast for the area calling for light rainfall and winds of 10 km per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Hansman, a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reviewed some of the footage shared on social media and without having reviewed flight data said the crash did not appear to have been caused by weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may have been an engine failure on one side that was mismanaged by the crew," he said. "It could be the thrust of the remaining engine that started the rotation downward."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US aviation safety consultant and former commercial pilot John Cox said he would want to validate the Flightradar data, which showed a lot of gyrations in speed, but regardless, something "really significant" happened to cause the plane to spin when it came down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't spin airliners," Cox said. "So that says at some point it stalled and then the flight crew lost control of it. But it appears that there may have been some catastrophic event before that loss of control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cenipa head Marcelo Moreno cautioned in a press conference that it was still too early to determine the cause of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From what we can tell so far, the aircraft did not reach out to traffic control reporting an emergency," Moreno said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voepass, Brazil's fourth-largest airline by market share, said it could not provide any additional information on what caused the plane to crash. It had originally reported 62 people aboard the aircraft, though local media interviewed a man who said he had missed the flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, the plane was carrying 57 passengers and four crew, Voepass said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Franco-Italian ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Leonardo, is the dominant producer of regional turboprop planes seating 40 to 70 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ATR told Reuters that its specialists were "fully engaged" with the investigation into the crash and its customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The motor on the plane was a PW 127 produced by Pratt & Whitney Canada, its parent company RTX Corp confirmed to Reuters. RTX said that it had offered assistance in the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both French and Canadian investigators will participate in the investigation, Moreno said. Europe's safety regulator also said it would offer technical assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash is Brazil's deadliest since 199 people were killed in 2007 on a flight operated by TAM, which later joined LAN to become what is now LATAM Airlines. (Reuters)

    Philippine court allows Rappler to keep operating

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Maria Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, was a vocal critic of former president Rodrigo Duterte and the deadly drug war he launched. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765491_1_20240809154850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Philippine news site co-founded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa can continue operating after a court overturned a shutdown order, according to the ruling released on Friday, in the latest legal victory for the media outfit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ressa and Rappler have been fighting multiple court cases filed during former president Rodrigo Duterte's administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, was a vocal critic of Duterte and the deadly drug war he launched in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That triggered what media advocates say was a grinding series of criminal charges, probes and online attacks against her and Rappler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeals decision, issued on July 23 but only released to the media on Friday, reversed a previous ruling by the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had ordered the shutdown of Rappler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SEC order had been a "grave abuse of discretion" and contravened "established procedures, jurisprudential and legal instructions, and clear intent of the Constitution", the court said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SEC shutdown order was issued on June 28, 2022, days before Duterte left office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It revoked Rappler's "certificate of incorporation" for violating constitutional and statutory restrictions on foreign ownership in mass media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rappler has continued operating as it appealed the SEC order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the constitution, investment in media is reserved for Filipinos or Filipino-controlled entities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case sprang from the 2015 investment from the US-based Omidyar Network, which was established by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Omidyar later transferred its investment in Rappler to the site's local managers to stave off efforts by Duterte to shut it down. (AFP)

 We've heard a lot over the past two weeks about athletes battling it out for the gold medal at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  What about ordinary people like you and I?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While our gold medal moments may not involve winning a place on the podium, we've all experienced things in life that made us incredibly happy or proud.

  Austrian authorities detained two suspects on Wednesday for allegedly plotting to attack one of three Vienna concerts by the US star due to start Thursday. All were cancelled at the last minute leaving disconsolate "Swifties" to gather in the Austrian capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old main suspect had confessed, saying he "intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives," domestic intelligence agency (DSN) head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner told a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert, either today or tomorrow," he added. The concerts were to run from Thursday to Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian, was employed at a facility management company which would have "provided services" at the Ernst Happel Stadium where Swift was to perform, said Haijawi-Pirchner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The younger suspect, who has so far refused to talk to authorities, was "in the area" of the stadium when he was detained, said Haijawi-Pirchner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chancellor Karl Nehammer said there were "concrete and detailed" plans to commit a "blood bath".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Interior Minister Gerhard Karner, a "tragedy was averted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation was very serious", he added, particularly in view of a recent attack at a Taylor Swift themed event in Britain, where three girls were killed in Great Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explosives and detonators were found in a search of the main suspect's apartment, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria's top security chief Franz Ruf told reporters the two suspects had recently made changes in their private lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main suspect, an Austrian with Northern Macedonian roots, had changed "his appearance and adapted it to Islamic State propaganda", while the second, an Austrian of Turkish or Croatian origin, had broken up with his girlfriend, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruf earlier confirmed that authorities had received information "from foreign partners" which led to the arrests, but he declined to specify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had promised to ramp up security for the concerts while having minimised any concrete danger, but organisers still cancelled Swift's shows. About 65,000 people were expected at each show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's fans gathered in parks and plazas across Vienna to share their disappointment. Dilyara Joldassova, a 23-year-old engineer who travelled from Kazakhstan for the show, said she was "broken-hearted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift did not immediately comment on the decision to cancel the Vienna shows but after the British attack said she was "completely in shock".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three girls were killed and five people seriously wounded in the mass stabbing at a dance class in Southport inspired by the American singer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Ruf, police "did everything humanly possible to ensure" that the Vienna concerts "could go ahead", but the cancellation decision was taken by the organisers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old star was to bring her record-breaking "Eras" Tour, which began its European leg in Paris in May, to Vienna on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following France, the tour stopped in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the end of last year, "Eras" had already become the first tour to sell more than US$1 billion in tickets and it's on track to more than double that by the time it concludes in Vancouver in December. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new Banksy artwork depicting a wolf on a satellite dish in London was removed, possibly stolen, less than an hour after it was unveiled by the elusive street artist on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The piece was the fourth animal-themed artwork that Banksy had installed in various parts of the UK capital this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The street artist, whose identity is unknown and the subject of feverish speculation, confirmed on Instagram that the works were his own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wolf silhouette was located on the roof of an empty shop in Peckham, southeast London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Photos from the scene carried by local media show a person climbing up a ladder to retrieve the satellite dish while another holds the ladder for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further images show an individual in shorts walking off with the piece of art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were called to reports of a stolen satellite dish containing artwork at 1:52 pm (12:52 GMT) on Thursday, 8 August in Rye Lane, Peckham," London's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There have been no arrests. Inquiries continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, a Banksy of a goat precariously perched on top of a wall with rocks tumbling down appeared in Richmond, southwest London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then on Tuesday two elephant silhouettes with their trunks stretched towards each other appeared in Fulham, southwest London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the black silhouette of three monkeys appeared on the side of a railway bridge as if they were swinging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several months usually pass between new Banksy artworks and this week's sudden spurt has sparked speculation among fans about their meaning. (AFP)

    Thousands join protests against racism in UK

    <![CDATA[<img alt="There were anti-racism rallies in English cities including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765272_1_20240808110122.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets in several English cities on Wednesday to oppose days of far-right violence that have had UK police on high alert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nightly riots -- during which mosques and migrant-related facilities have been attacked -- have erupted across towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland fuelled by a wave of misinformation surrounding the murder of three children on July 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on Wednesday evening, it was anti-racism and anti-fascist counter-protesters who were out in greater numbers, holding rallies in cities up and down England including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whose streets? Our streets!" chanted protesters at a few-thousand-strong gathering in Walthamstow, northeast London, where some held banners saying "Stop the far right".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I live in the borough and we don't want these people on our streets... they don't represent us," Sara Tresilian, 58, told AFP, referring to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You have to turn out (and) give that message... I think it's important that you show up for your friends and neighbours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andy Valentine, the Met Police's deputy assistant commissioner, thanked "communities for coming together across the capital and for showing community spirit this evening".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sheffield, activists chanted "Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here," as riot police looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Birmingham, hundreds of anti-racism protesters gathered outside a migrant support centre, while in Brighton, around 2,000 people took part in a peaceful demonstration, according to police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some friction, however, as in the southern town of Aldershot, where the PA reported police had to intervene between anti-racism activists and a group of people shouting "Stop the boats" -- a reference to migrants who reach Britain by crossing the English Channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had put 6,000 specialist police on standby to deal with the approximately 100 demonstrations by far-right activists and counter-protesters that were advertised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a social media post, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper thanked "all the police officers working tonight to protect & support local communities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Courts have started to order jail terms for offenders tied to the unrest as authorities seek to head off new troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disorder, Britain's worst since the 2011 London riots, has seen almost 430 people arrested and at least 120 charged, and has led several countries to issue travel warnings for the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence broke out after three girls aged nine, seven and six were killed and five more children critically injured during a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, northwest England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  False rumours initially spread on social media saying the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. The suspect was later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, born in Wales. UK media reported that his parents are from Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rioting that followed has seen demonstrators throw bricks and flares at police officers, burn cars, and attack mosques and at least two hotels that have been used for asylum seekers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned anyone involved will face "the full force of the law", including those inciting violence online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer, a former chief state prosecutor, has pledged "substantive sentencing before the end of this week" for rioters, and his government has freed up an extra 500 prison places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scores of accused, including teenagers, have already appeared before judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, a man was jailed for three years after he pleaded guilty to violent disorder and assaulting a police officer in Southport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other men received sentences of 20 months and 30 months for participating in violence in Liverpool on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three men sentenced today are the tip of the iceberg, and just the start of what will be a very painful process for many who foolishly chose to involve themselves in violent unrest," said prosecutor Jonathan Egan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have blamed the disorder on figures associated with the now-defunct English Defence League (EDL), a far-right Islamophobic organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EDL founder Tommy Robinson has been accused by authorities of stoking tensions, and police in Cyprus, where he was reported to be on holiday, said on Wednesday they were ready to assist UK police if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Robinson later wrote on the X social media platform: "Lucky I'm not in Cyprus then".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK lawmakers have accused social media sites of fuelling the violence. Tech billionaire and X owner Elon Musk in particular has angered the government with a series of provocative tweets, including that a British "civil war is inevitable". (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Arthur Lee Burton, 54, was put to death via lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765259_1_20240808091242.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Texas man was executed on Wednesday for the 1997 murder of a woman who was jogging in her Houston neighbourhood, one of two executions scheduled this week in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Arthur Lee Burton, 54, was put to death via lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, and pronounced dead at 6:47 pm Central time, officials from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the western state of Utah is scheduled to carry out an execution overnight, its first in 14 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taberon Honie, 48, is to be put to death shortly after midnight Mountain Time (0600 GMT Thursday) for the 1998 murder and sexual assault of his ex-girlfriend's mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Honie is to be executed by lethal injection at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Utah's last execution was carried out by firing squad in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burton, the death row inmate in Texas, was convicted of the July 1997 murder of Nancy Adleman, a mother of three who was attacked while out jogging. Adleman was strangled with her own shoelaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burton's lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court to stay his execution but the request was denied without comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His attorneys had argued that Burton should be constitutionally exempt from being put to death because he is intellectually disabled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To all the people I have hurt and caused pain, I wish we didn't have to be here at this moment, but I want you to know that I am sorry for putting y'all through this," Burton said in his final statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including Burton, Texas has carried out three executions since January and there have been 11 in the United States this year so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death penalty has been abolished in 23 US states, while six others (Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee) have moratoriums in place. (AFP)

    Harris picks 'real deal' governor Walz as running mate

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris said on Tuesday she was "proud" to tap Tim Walz as her running mate, opting for the Minnesota governor with blue-collar credentials as the partner most likely to boost her historic White House bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Walz had been on a vice-presidential shortlist with a string of other Democratic figures seen as broadening Harris's appeal as she sprints into the contest against Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming to make history as the first woman US president, Harris, already a trailblazer as the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, has little time before Election Day on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am proud to announce that I've asked Tim Walz to be my running mate," she posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his. It's great to have him on the team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden quickly expressed support for his deputy's "great decision" to choose Walz, saying the duo "will be a powerful voice for working people and America's great middle class."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations had always been that Harris would pick a white man to balance the ticket and help win over working-class, white, male voters, a demographic that propelled Trump to victory in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy manner, decades of military experience and a rural perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dismisses the "nonsense" of Trump and Republican running mate J.D. Vance, and he is also a gun-owner who tweets about hunting, goes ice-fishing and rides rollercoasters with his daughter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The onetime teacher and school sports coach flipped a Republican district in 2006 to win a seat in the House of Representatives in a state seen as light years from the coastal elites of California, Harris's home turf, or the East Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, Walz will appeal to the left for championing cannabis legalization, worker protections, abortion rights, and tighter firearm restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's campaign branded the Minnesotan as a "dangerously liberal extremist" seeking to impose California values on the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic grandee Nancy Pelosi swatted such criticism aside, telling MSNBC that Walz "is right down the middle. He's a heartland of America Democrat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz earned enthusiastic endorsements from Democratic liberals as well as centrists like Senator Joe Manchin, who called him "the real deal." (AFP)

    Somalis protest after Al-Shabaab terror attack

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Somalis joined a demonstration on Monday against the jihadist group Al-Shabaab at the site of a deadly beachfront attack in the capital Mogadishu last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A suicide bomber and gunmen attacked the popular Lido Beach on Friday evening, killing 37 people and wounding scores more, in one of the deadliest strikes in the East African country in months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We came here to Lido Beach to show we can't be intimidated," said one of the protesters, Abdisalam Ahmed Abdullahi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mogadishu people are not afraid of Kharijite enemy," he said, using a government term for the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants who have carried out numerous attacks in the predominantly Muslim country for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survivors of Friday's assault described how following an explosion, gunmen stormed onto the beach intending to "kill everyone they could," with graphic video shared online showing bloodied bodies on the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Shabaab has been waging a bloody insurgency against Somalia's fragile federal government for more than 17 years and has previously targeted the Lido beach area, which is popular with business people and government members as well as ordinary Somalis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Somali people in general, and those in Mogadishu particularly, need to unite in fighting against the enemy," said Livestock Minister Hassan Hussein, one of several government officials who joined the rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described Al-Shabaab militants as "bedbugs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amina Ibrahim Halane said she joined the rally to show sympathy for the victims of Friday's attack, saying they were simply "innocent men... enjoying their city." (AFP)

    Debby blows US$1mn in cocaine onto Florida beach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The haul of cocaine was discovered by a good Samaritan, who contacted the authorities. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764886_1_20240806003726.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hurricane Debby landed in Florida on Monday bringing high winds, pouring rain – and 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than US$1 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Debby, which hit the state's northern Big Bend region as a Category One hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, washed the trove of drugs ashore along Florida's southernmost tip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hurricane Debby blew 25 packages of cocaine onto a beach in the Florida Keys," US Border Patrol acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The load of drugs, which Briggs reported was valued at more than US$1 million, was discovered by a good Samaritan who contacted the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July of 2023, the mayor of Tampa, Florida similarly discovered 31.7 kilogrammes of cocaine that had been washed ashore in the Florida Keys, while enjoying a vacation day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to bringing cocaine, Debby has killed one person, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, and could produce life-threatening storm surges as well as catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Keys, a string of islands stretching off the state's southern tip, are located in close proximity to a number of Caribbean countries that serve as a transit hub for cocaine being trafficked from South America to Europe and North America, including into Florida. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's Civil Defence agency said it received the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians from Israel on Monday, which it buried in a mass grave.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We received 80 bodies inside 15 bags, with more than four martyrs in each bag, each wrapped in a single shroud", said Civil Defence director Yamen Abu Suleiman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Suleiman said Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not know if they are martyrs (killed in Gaza) or prisoners from (Israel's) jails," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video released by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, men in hazmat suits could be seen inspecting the corpses, before unloading them from the shipping container they had arrived in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The footage then showed the bodies being laid in a line for burial in a mass grave dug in the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were later buried at the Turkish cemetery, near Khan Younis, the main city in the southern part of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salwa Karaz, a displaced woman from Gaza City in the north, said that she had gone to the Turkish cemetery hoping to find her 32-year-old son Marwan, who went missing in January. He left behind an eight-month-old son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we learned that 80 bodies had been handed over, we came to search in hopes of finding him among them", said the 59-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of now, we have not learned anything," she lamented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will try to identify him through his clothes. He was wearing brown pants, a navy blue shirt, a black jacket, and beige boots."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She last saw him leaving on his bicycle from their shelter in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released on Monday, Hamas said Israel's delivery of bodies without identities "exacerbates the suffering of the families of martyrs and the missing, who seek to know the fate of their abducted children or to bury their martyrs in a dignified manner."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Hamas government sources said Israel returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians killed in Gaza after taking them from morgues and graves to check there were no hostages among them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were then buried in Gaza, the sources added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,623 people, according to Gaza's health ministry which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    Bangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman takes charge

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters march towards Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's palace. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764866_1_20240805212642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladesh army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman spent nearly four decades rising to the top of the military and said on Monday he was "taking full responsibility" after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted and fled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bedecked with medal ribbons on his green fatigues and wearing a four-star general's cap, Waker said 76-year-old Hasina had quit and that the army would "form an interim government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I give you my word that all the injustices will be addressed," the career infantry officer said in a broadcast to the nation on state television, although it was not immediately clear if he would head the new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed – it is time to stop the violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mild-looking, bespectacled officer was appointed as chief of army staff, the military's top job, only in June. Hasina had trusted him because he was a distant relative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The experienced soldier has served as a UN peacekeeper as well as in Hasina's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His father-in-law was army chief during the first of Hasina's five terms as prime minister from 1996-2001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a caretaker government for two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina then ruled Bangladesh from 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protesters stormed Hasina's palace on Monday and she fled by helicopter, Waker said he would speak to the president to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed that the new authorities would "prosecute all murders" following weeks of deadly protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army was deployed on the streets to crush the protests last month but shifted on Sunday and in several instances allowed demonstrations to go on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker said he had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members, although not with Hasina's Awami League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of us together will forge a beautiful future," he said. "If we work together, we can achieve a favourable outcome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bangladesh Military Academy graduate, who served two tours as a UN peacekeeper in Angola and Liberia, called for the weeks of protests to stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 300 people were killed in the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the situation gets better, there is no need for emergency," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker appealed to the university students who first launched protests in early July to support the army. The protests were initially against government hiring rules but spiralled into demands for Hasina to leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now the task of the students is to keep calm and help us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker, who Bangladeshi media say is aged 57 or 58, also received officer training in Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Married with two daughters, he holds master's degrees in defence studies from Bangladesh's National University and King's College London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was commissioned in 1985, also serving as an instructor at the army's college for infantry and tactics and at Bangladesh's institute for peace support operations. (AFP)

    UK PM Starmer vows rioters will 'regret' disorder

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK leader Keir Starmer warned far-right protesters on Sunday they would "regret" participating in England's worst rioting in 13 years, as disturbances linked to the murder of three children earlier this week flared across the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unrest related to misinformation about the mass stabbing last Monday in the northwestern English seaside town of Southport has hit multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is a major challenge for Starmer, elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves," Starmer said in a TV address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was "no justification" for what he called "far-right thuggery", he added, promising to bring the perpetrators "to justice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the northeastern English city of Middlesbrough, hundreds of protesters squared up to riot police carrying shields. Some threw bricks, cans and pots at officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters there seized a camera from an AFP crew and broke it. The journalists were not injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fresh disturbances came after police said more than 150 people had been arrested since Saturday following skirmishes at far-right rallies in Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police -- injuring several officers -- and looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is the worst England has seen since summer 2011, when widespread rioting followed the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late Sunday, Staffordshire police said another hotel known to have sheltered asylum seekers was targeted near Birmingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large group of individuals" have been "throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police" at the hotel in the town of Tamworth, with one officer injured, said the statement. (AFP)

    Zelensky says Ukraine has received first F-16 jets

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine has received its first batch of US-made F-16 fighter jets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, quickly adding that more are needed to beat back Russian forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For more than two years, Ukraine has pleaded with its Western partners for the aircraft – long considered the crown jewel in the sprawling list of military hardware Kyiv has sought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We often heard the word 'impossible'. Now it is a reality. Reality in our skies. F-16s in Ukraine. We made it happen," Zelensky said, as some flew above him during the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky was standing in front of what looked like two grey, partially-covered F-16s branded with the Ukrainian trident, in a location reporters were asked not to disclose for security reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am proud of all our guys who are mastering these aircraft and have already started using them for our country," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not say how many jets had been delivered and declined to comment on their specific tasks, but journalists saw at least two F-16s on the spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement was welcomed by many as Kyiv's forces are struggling to hold back advances by Russian troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the combat aircraft we have been waiting for, which can significantly enhance our capabilities," said Parliament chairman Ruslan Stefanchuk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv hopes the arrival of the fighter jets – touted for their precision, speed and range – will enable it to better protect itself from Russian bombardment. (AFP)

    Death toll mounts as clashes escalate in Bangladesh

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi protesters demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resign clashed with government supporters on Sunday, with scores killed in one of the deadliest days since demonstrations began.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas have escalated into some of the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to step down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 77 people were killed on Sunday alone, including 14 police officers, with the rival sides battling with sticks and knives and security forces firing rifles, taking the total killed since protests began in July to at least 283.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said protesters attacked their officers, including storming a station in the northeastern town of Enayetpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The terrorists attacked the police station and killed 11 policemen," said Bijoy Basak, a deputy inspector general.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses in Dhaka reported hearing sustained crackles of gunfire after dark on Sunday, with protesters defying a nationwide curfew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 12 people were killed in the capital, police and doctors at hospitals said, several with bullet wounds, while 18 were killed in Bangladesh's northern district of Sirajganj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mobile internet was tightly restricted countrywide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In several cases, soldiers and police did not intervene to stem the protests, unlike the past month of rallies that repeatedly ended in deadly crackdowns. (AFP)

    UK grapples with worst riots in 13 years

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK authorities faced growing pressure on Sunday to put an end to England's worst rioting in 13 years after disturbances linked to child murders and involving far-riot agitators flared across the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Unrest related to misinformation about a mass stabbing that killed three young girls earlier this week has spread to multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is posing a major test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the latest incident, trouble flared in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Sunday when masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 people were arrested on Saturday after skirmishes broke out at far-right rallies in numerous places, including Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police – injuring several officers – looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is the worst England has seen since the summer of 2011, when widespread rioting took place following the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're now seeing it (trouble) flooding across major cities and towns," said Tiffany Lynch of the Police Federation of England and Wales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the police have "all the resources they need" to deal with the disorder, as forces drafted in thousands of extra officers to try to stop the violence from spreading further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Policing minister Diana Johnson told BBC News on Sunday that the rioting would "not be tolerated," while justice minister Shabana Mahmood has insisted that "the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disturbance in Rotherham marked the fifth day of skirmishes following Monday's frenzied knife attack at a Taylor Swift-theme dance party in Southport, near Liverpool on England's northwest coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, who is accused of killing a six, seven, and nine-year-old, and injuring another 10 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have blamed the violence on supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Agitators have targeted mosques in Southport and in the northeastern English city of Sunderland, leading to hundreds of Islamic centres bolstering security amid fears for their worshippers' safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants have waved English and British flags while chanting slogans like "Stop the boats" – a reference to irregular migrants travelling to Britain from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-fascist demonstrators have held counter-rallies in many cities, including Leeds where they shouted, "Nazi scum off our streets," as the far-right protesters chanted, "You're not English any more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not all the gatherings have turned violent. A peaceful one in Aldershot, southern England, on Sunday saw participants hold placards that read "Stop the invasion" and "We're not far right, we're just right."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are fed up with being told you should be ashamed if you're white and working class but I'm proud white working class," 41-year-old Karina, who did not give her surname, said in Nottingham on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commentators have suggested that the demonstrators, spurred on by online influencers, may feel emboldened by the political ascendancy of anti-immigration elements in British politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last month's election, the Reform UK party led by Brexit cheerleader Nigel Farage captured 14 percent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carla Denyer, co-leader of the left-wing Green party said the unrest should be "a wake-up call to all politicians who have actively promoted or given in" to anti-immigration rhetoric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and has announced new measures to allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling. (AFP)

 Hezbollah said on Saturday it had launched dozens of Katyusha rockets at Israel, the latest in a series of attacks it says is in support of the Palestinian people.

  The Lebanese group said its latest attack, on Beit Hillel in northern Israel, was in response to Israel's attacks on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Middle East tensions soared on Saturday as Iran and its allies readied their response to the assassination of Hamas's political leader, blamed on Israel, spurring fears of a regional war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel ally the United States said it would move warships and fighter jets to the region, while Western governments called on their citizens to leave Lebanon -- where the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based -- and airlines cancelled flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing this week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran-backed groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel on Saturday again traded fire with Hezbollah, carried out a deadly raid in the occupied West Bank, and struck a school compound in Gaza City in an attack that the Hamas-ruled territory's civil defence agency said killed at least 17 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous schools turned into displacement shelters have been hit across Gaza in recent weeks, with Israel insisting the facilities had been used by militants. Hamas denied using civilian infrastructure for military activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh was buried on Friday in Qatar, where he had been based. Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of carrying out the attack, has not directly commented on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran said on Saturday it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pentagon said it was bolstering its military presence in the Middle East to protect US personnel and defend Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said an aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln would be deployed, as well as additional ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers and a new fighter squadron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden, at his beach home in Delaware, was asked by reporters if he thought Iran would stand down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope so," he said. "I don't know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at the northern Israeli settlement of Beit Hillel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said it was in response to an Israeli attack on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in southern Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its fighters, including a 17-year-old from Deir Siriane. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right protesters clashed with British police during tense rallies on Saturday as unrest linked to disinformation about a mass stabbing that killed three young girls spread across the UK.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The violence, which has seen scores of arrests across England and put Britain's Muslim community on edge, presents the biggest challenge yet of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer's month-old premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also put hard-right agitators in the spotlight at a time when anti-immigration elements are enjoying some electoral success in British politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators threw chairs, flares and bricks at officers in the northwestern English city of Liverpool, while scuffles between police and protesters broke out in nearby Manchester.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merseyside Police said "a number of officers have been injured as they deal with serious disorder" in Liverpool city centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC reported that protesters smashed the windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants in the northeastern city of Hull. Police said three officers had been injured and four people arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Belfast, Northern Ireland, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islam group and an anti-racism rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Leeds, northern England, around 150 people carrying English flags chanted, "You're not English any more" while counter-protesters shouted "Nazi scum off our streets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposing groups of protesters also faced off in the central city of Nottingham and Bristol in the southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The skirmishes marked the fourth day of unrest in several towns and cities following Monday's frenzied knife attack in Southport, near Liverpool on England's northwest coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, charged with several counts of murder and attempted murder over the attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rudakubana is accused of killing Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, and injuring another 10 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts would "face the full force of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And reacting to Saturday's clashes, he said there was "no excuse" for the violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After talks with senior ministers he "reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe," said a statement from his office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence started late on Tuesday in Southport itself, where a mob threw bricks at a mosque. That prompted hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police blamed supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unrest then rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later, where 111 people were arrested outside Starmer's Downing Street residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, 10 people were arrested and four officers required hospital treatment following a riot in the northeastern English city of Sunderland in which at least one car was set on fire and a shop looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mob also torched a police station and attacked a mosque.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder," Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall told reporters on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events planned for Saturday and Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were advertised on far-right social media channels as "enough is enough" anti-immigration rallies. Anti-fascism groups have staged numerous counter-protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In London, demonstrators attending a regular pro-Palestinian march appeared undeterred by a separate anti-immigration protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My parents told me not to come today but I am from here. The UK is my home," said 24-year-old student Meraaj Harun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer this week announced new measures that will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour politicians have accused Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage of stoking the trouble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last month's election, his anti-immigration Reform UK party captured 14 percent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party. (AFP)

    Thousands in Venezuela protest Maduro's victory claim

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado's appearance delighted the crowd. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764634_1_20240804022718.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people, led by a top opposition figure, gathered across Venezuela on Saturday to protest the widely disputed reelection of President Nicolas Maduro, as his supporters responded to his own call for competing rallies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado thrilled supporters in Caracas when she made a surprise appearance in a truck bearing a banner reading "Venezuela has won!" after spending several days in hiding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machado had backed the candidacy of Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia after she herself was banned from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Backers cried out "Freedom!" as her truck passed by on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never been so strong as today," Machado told the crowd, adding that "the regime has never been weaker... it has lost all legitimacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro also called on his supporters to turn out for "the mother of all marches" later in the afternoon. He accused the opposition of plotting attacks against security forces during their rallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eleven civilians reportedly have died and more than 1,000 have been detained in the protests that erupted after the country's CNE election authority, loyal to Maduro, on Friday proclaimed him the winner with 52 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Gonzalez Urrutia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that result has been rejected by countries including the United States, Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and Uruguay. They say available results show the opposition candidate to be the clear winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has ordered the expulsion of diplomats from some countries questioning his victory. Argentine diplomats who reached Buenos Aires on Saturday said power had been cut to their embassy, as hooded police kept guard outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 61-year-old Maduro has reacted fiercely to the widespread international criticism, describing allegations of vote fraud as a "trap" orchestrated by Washington to justify "a coup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has led the oil-rich, cash-poor country since 2013, presiding over a GDP drop of 80 percent that pushed more than seven million of once-wealthy Venezuela's 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts blame economic mismanagement and US sanctions for the collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia did not show up to a hearing at the Supreme Court after Maduro requested the tribunal investigate and certify the election result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, other opposition candidates summoned to the hearing called for a detailed vote count to be made public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has launched a website with copies of 84 percent of ballots cast, showing an easy win for Gonzalez Urrutia. The government claims these are forged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machado, who was barred from running herself, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that she was in hiding and "fearing for my life," along with other opposition leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO Foro Penal reported 11 dead in protests on Monday and Tuesday as angry Venezuelans took to the streets, and Machado said at least 20 people had been killed. Officials said one soldier died as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crackdown has sparked fear among opposition supporters, with memories still fresh of a wave of repression under the Maduro government in 2017 that left some 100 people dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have dead, wounded, detainees, missing people... People know it. They are afraid," Katiusca Camargo, an activist in the Petare slum in eastern Caracas, said on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday there was "overwhelming evidence" that Gonzalez Urrutia had won the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken spoke with Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia on Friday, expressing "his concern for their safety and well-being" and congratulating Gonzalez Urrutia "for receiving the most votes," the State Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a joint statement, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico urged an "impartial verification" of the result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro's previous reelection, in 2018, was rejected by dozens of Latin American countries as well as the United States and European Union member states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoys loyalty from the military leadership, electoral bodies, courts and other state institutions, as well as the backing of Russia, China and Cuba. (AFP)

    Surging Harris, Trump spar over debate dates

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kamala Harris's campaign communications director says Donald Trump is "running scared." Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764633_1_20240804013010.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris's campaign branded Donald Trump "scared" on Saturday after he proposed to change the presidential debate schedule ahead of a rally in Georgia where he will try to halt the vice president's surging momentum in her bid to become America's first woman president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an overnight post on his Truth Social app, Trump said he was willing to debate Harris on the conservative Fox News network on September 4, while declining to participate in a previously scheduled debate on ABC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump pitched the idea before going to a rally in Atlanta, where he will gather supporters in the same arena where Harris addressed an excited crowd of some 10,000 just this Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said he had "agreed" to the debate plan with Fox. And he said it would take place in Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state in the US presidential electoral system – in front of a live audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris campaign dismissed this as "games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out," Harris's campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. "He needs to... show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal to confront Harris on a network that has long supported him was the latest Trump effort to recapture the initiative in a campaign that had been entirely focused on a rematch against 81-year-old Joe Biden, until he dramatically dropped his reelection bid on July 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Harris, 59, has reenergised the Democratic base almost overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has raked in donations, reassembled the team behind Barack Obama's two historic election victories, and neutralised the solid lead that 78-year-old Trump had built against Biden in opinion polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, she secured the official Democratic nomination, backed by near unanimous party support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris is due imminently to announce her vice presidential pick, with the popular governor of key state Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, a frontrunner. On Tuesday, she is set to launch a countrywide tour with her yet-to-be-named running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, Trump will be joined by his own vice presidential pick, Senator JD Vance, at the rally in Georgia – another battleground state that will help decide who wins the Electoral College majority on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lost narrowly to Biden there in 2020 and the state was at the centre of his unprecedented attempts to overturn the results of the election and refusal to accept defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The size of Harris's rally on Tuesday was a warning sign to the Trump campaign, which has long touted its ability to draw thousands of passionate supporters, in contrast to Biden's usually meagre crowds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The situation is a remarkable turnaround in a campaign where Trump had been appearing to gather force while Biden – hurt by a disastrous debate performance in June and mounting voter concerns over his mental acuity – was steadily slipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris's rapid entry has left the Trump campaign scrambling – and Trump now the oldest presidential nominee in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adding to the changed dynamics, Harris is vying to become the first woman president and the first of black and Indian bi-racial heritage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump drew gasps at a convention of black journalists this week when he claimed that Harris, who has identified closely with her black roots all her life, was only pretending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black," he said. (AFP)

    Gaza officials say Israeli strike kills 17 at school

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike struck a school compound in Gaza City on Saturday, killing at least 17 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are 17 martyrs and several wounded due to Israeli bombardment on Hamama school," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. The Israeli military confirmed the strike, saying it had hit a Hamas command and control centre located inside the compound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bassal said the compound was housing Palestinians displaced from their homes in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the compound was being used by Hamas militants to manufacture weapons, adding it was a "hiding place for Hamas terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilian facilities as command and control centres or to hide their commanders and militants. The Palestinian group denies the accusation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held hostage in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's withering military campaign has killed at least 39,550 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)
