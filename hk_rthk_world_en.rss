<div class="itemFullText">
 An aid group said on Saturday it recovered the bodies of 11 migrants off the Libyan coast and transferred them to an Italian coast guard ship off Lampedusa island, where thousands are trying to reach from North Africa.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The aid group, Doctors Without Borders, said its Geo Barents rescue ship had recovered the bodies following a search operation that lasted more than nine hours, after being alerted by German humanitarian organisation Sea-Watch, which also rescues migrants at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German group said it was unclear whether the migrants were victims of a previous shipwreck, adding they had tried to contact Libya’s coast guard to recover the bodies but received no reply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Saturday’s mission, the Sea-Watch crew also discovered another body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As we cannot determine the reason behind this tragedy, we know that people will continue to take dangerous routes in a desperate attempt to reach safety, and Europe must find safe and legal pathways for them,” Doctors Without Borders, also known as MSF, wrote in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MSF vessel was ordered to transport the other 165 people onboard, who were rescued during its Mediterranean operations, to the northern port of Genoa. The group complained that the decision would significantly delay assistance to migrants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of migrants leaving from North African countries try to reach Europe using Libya as a departing point, as they brave a dangerous journey across the Mediterranean to escape war and poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central Mediterranean route remains the world’s most dangerous crossing. In 2023, more than 3,000 people went missing on this route, according to the International Organisation for Migration. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers continued searching for British TV presenter Michael Mosley on the mountainous Greek island of Symi on Saturday, the third day of a wide operation launched after he was reported missing by his wife.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 67-year-old doctor and healthy living advocate, who has endorsed fasting and offered tips on sleep and diet, was last seen at 1:30 pm (1030 GMT) on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He disappeared after he set out on a stroll in searing temperatures along a rocky coastal path from Agios Nikolaos beach to the village of Pedi. Mosley did not have his mobile phone with him, hampering tracing efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police, the fire brigade, the coast guard and volunteers have been searching on and off the island in the eastern Aegean assisted by a helicopter, drones and rescue dogs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, police searches shifted focus to another rocky area, between Pedi and the beach of Agia Marina, after video footage showed Mosley walking through the village of Pedi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The search continues," said spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou. "We are investigating on foot another rocky part, the wider area of Agia Marina."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divers were also involved in the operation and vessels sailing nearby were on alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images from a security camera in Pedi showed what is believed to be Mosley, strolling by at 1:49 pm on Wednesday, holding a sun umbrella, suggesting he may have made it safely off the coastal path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Symi Mayor Lefteris Papakalodoukas said that the images and video footage from security cameras had helped sketch out what authorities believed was Mosley's possible route, which he described as "unconventional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They indicated that he may have continued further through Pedi into another challenging area around Agia Marina, the mayor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mosley has appeared on well-known UK TV programmes including Trust Me, I'm a Doctor, The One Show and This Morning. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit on Saturday as the two allies aim to show off their partnership on global security issues and move past trade tensions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday and met separately the following day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris. The leaders both used those engagements to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv's fight against Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv's defence, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France's tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-Élysées leading to the Élysée Palace, where the two held official meetings and were delivering public statements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later, there is a state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Proud to be here," Biden said at the Arc de Triomphe. "A great honour.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the Covid-19 pandemic receded. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli forces rescued four hostages alive from two locations in the central Gaza area of al-Nuseirat on Saturday, the military said, eight months after they were kidnapped by Hamas-led militants in a deadly incursion into Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The four hostages, three males and one female who were abducted from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on October 7 last year, were taken to hospital for medical checks, the military said, and were in good health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were identified as Noa Argamani, 25, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After eight months of devastating war in Gaza triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack, 116 of the approximately 250 hostages abducted by militants are left in the Palestinian enclave, according to Israeli tallies – at least 40 of whom have been declared dead in absentia by authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's chief military spokesman said the rescue operation was held under fire in the heart of a residential neighbourhood, where he said Hamas had been concealing hostages among Gaza civilians under the armed guard of militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a televised news conference, spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said one Israeli soldier had been badly injured. Israeli forces returned fire, including with airstrikes, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza health ministry said more than 200 Palestinians were killed and about 400 wounded in the Israeli operation. It did not say how many of the fatalities were combatants but said that women and children were among the dead. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Danish police said on Saturday a 39-year-old man would appear in front of a judge for preliminary questioning in relation to an assault on the country's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in central Copenhagen late on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Frederiksen, leader of Denmark's Social Democratic Party and prime minister since 2019, was shocked after being beaten by a man at Kultorvet square in Copenhagen on Friday, her office said in a statement on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister was able to walk away and had no outward signs of harm after the assault, Soren Kjergaard, who works as a barista in central Copenhagen, told Reuters after seeing her being escorted away by security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the man would be brought before the Copenhagen City Court for questioning at around 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), but declined to provide more detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither the police nor the prime minister's office said anything about the man's motive or whether he had carried a weapon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault comes two days before Danes head to the polls in the European Union election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A month ago, three German politicians suffered assaults ahead of European Parliament and district council elections and more attacks followed earlier this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several EU leaders condemned the incident, which happened just three weeks after Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico was seriously injured in an assassination attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attack on Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is an intolerable act of violence that represents an attack on the heart of democratic values," Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president said on X:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so shocked at the news of you being assaulted tonight. I condemn this despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe. I wish you strength and courage - I know you have plenty of both." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspected organised crime boss in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro was killed on Friday in a shoot-out with police as they tried to arrest him, local authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rio's civil police said in a statement that Rui Paulo Goncalves Estevao, also known as Pipito, was the alleged head of an organized criminal group accused of extortion and sowing terror in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When he was approached, he attacked the agents and a confrontation ensued. The criminal was hit and taken to a local hospital, but died of his wounds," police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rio Governor Claudio Castro said police had dealt a "hard blow against criminals who disturb the peace of the population".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Castro wrote on social media site X that Pipito earlier "gave the order to burn 35 buses" in western Rio neighbourhoods in retaliation for the death of a relative of another alleged crime boss, who is in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rio's organised crime groups, known as militias, were founded about four decades ago by former law enforcement officers and originally presented as self-defence organizations to fight against violent drug traffickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In reality, they function as mafias that control various businesses through extortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militias have also seized public land to illegally build housing or commercial buildings, with real estate becoming a key source of revenue. (AFP)

    HK-born US astronaut Anders dies in plane crash

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ninety-year-old Anders was piloting the plane alone when it went down north of Seattle. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756615_1_20240608123325.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong-born retired US astronaut William Anders, who was one of the first three humans to orbit the moon, capturing the famed "Earthrise" photo during Nasa's Apollo 8 mission in 1968, died on Friday in the crash of a small aeroplane in Washington state. He was 90.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NASA chief Bill Nelson paid tribute to Anders on social media with a post of the iconic image of Earth rising over the lunar horizon, saying the former Air Force pilot "offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Heritage Flight Museum near Burlington, Washington, which he co-founded, confirmed that Anders was killed in an aircraft accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was piloting the plane alone when it went down off the coast of Jones Island, part of the San Juan Islands archipelago north of Seattle, between Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, The Seattle Times reported, citing his son, Greg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to television station KCPQ-TV, a Fox affiliate in Tacoma, Anders, a resident of San Juan County, was at the controls of a vintage Air Force single-engine T-34 Mentor that he owned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed on KCPQ showed a plane plunging from the skies in a steep dive before slamming into the water just offshore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US Naval Academy graduate and Air Force pilot, Anders joined Nasa in 1963 as a member of the third group of astronauts. He did not go into space until December 21, 1968, when Apollo 8 lifted off on the first crewed mission to leave Earth orbit and travel 240,000 miles (386,000 km) to the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was the "rookie" on the crew, alongside Frank Borman, the mission commander, and James Lovell, who had flown with Borman on Gemini 7 in 1965 and later commanded the ill-fated Apollo 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apollo 8, originally scheduled for 1969, was pushed forward because of concerns the Russians were accelerating their own plans for a trip around the moon by the end of 1968. That gave the crew only several months to train for the historic but highly risky mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carried by a Saturn V rocket never before used on a crewed flight and tested only twice, the spacecraft faced the delicate and daunting task of entering and leaving lunar orbit safely. Failure meant crashing into the moon or being forever stranded in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recalling the mission 40 years later, Anders acknowledged that although confident of success, he thought "there was a one-third chance" the crew "didn't come back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trepidation turned to triumph when Apollo 8 reached the moon on Christmas Eve and during its 10 orbits captivated a worldwide television audience of more than a billion people by transmitting the first pictures of the lunar surface just miles below.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key part of the mission was photographing the moon, but "after about the third revolution, the moon was clearly kind of a boring place. There was nothing but holes and holes upon holes," Anders said at a symposium in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts' focus shifted abruptly when the Earth began rising over the lunar surface. "Me, Lovell and Borman suddenly said at once: 'Look at that' - this gorgeous, colourful, beautiful planet of ours coming up over the ugly lunar horizon," Anders told Forbes magazine in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a long lens and colour film, Anders ended up snapping the photograph now known as "Earthrise." The image, vividly capturing both the Earth's beauty and fragility in the vastness of space, is considered one of history's most influential photographs, widely credited with helping inspire the environmental movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Here we came all the way to the moon to discover Earth," Anders later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also played a key role in another indelible episode from that Christmas Eve mission - leading off as the crew read from the Book of Genesis while Apollo 8 transmitted images of the lunar surface to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three astronauts were greeted as national heroes when they splashed down three days later in the Pacific Ocean and were feted as Time magazine's "Men of the Year." (Reuters)

 Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was on Friday "hit" by a man on a Copenhagen square, her office said, with EU chiefs quickly condemning the attack.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Danish prime minister's office said in a statement that Frederiksen was "shocked by the incident," but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was hit by a man Friday evening on Kultorvet in Copenhagen. The man was subsequently arrested," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes on the heels of a spate of attacks on politicians from across the political spectrum at work or on the campaign trail in Germany ahead of this week's EU elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On May 15, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot four times at close range as he greeted supporters after a government meeting in the central town of Handlova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fico, who survived the assassination attempt, was taken to a hospital in a nearby city after the shooting, where he underwent two lengthy surgeries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU chief Charles Michel and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola on Friday slammed the attack on Frederiksen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Metsola urged the Danish head of government to "keep strong," while adding in a post to X that "violence has no place in politics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel in turn said he was "outraged by the assault."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I strongly condemn this cowardly act of aggression," the European Council president said in a separate post to X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copenhagen police confirmed that an incident involving the prime minister had occurred but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have one person arrested in the case, which we are now investigating. At this time, we have no further comments or remarks on the case," police said in a statement on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I must say that it shakes all of us who are close to her," Danish Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke said in a post to social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Something like this must not happen in our beautiful, safe and free country," he said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday was formally elected as the leader of the National Democratic Alliance coalition, which won the most number of seats in the country's national election after his political party failed to win a majority on its own.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 73-year-old leader, who will be sworn in as prime minister on Sunday for a rare third term, will now form a coalition government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi’s Hindu nationalist BJP has governed India as part of the NDA coalition over the past decade, but this is the first time under his leadership that the party has needed support from its regional allies to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This alliance of ours reflects India's spirit in its true sense,” Modi said after the BJP and coalition members backed him as their prime ministerial candidate. “We were neither defeated nor are we defeated ... it was an NDA government in the past, still is and will be,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Full results from India’s six week-long election, which began in mid-April, were released on Wednesday. The BJP won 240 seats, well below the 272 mark needed for a majority in a stunning upset. Together, the parties in the NDA coalition bagged 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Modi's political challenger, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, put up a stronger-than-expected fight, defying predictions of decline by doubling its strength from the last election to win a total of 232 seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Modi was formally elected as the NDA leader, local media reported that the two key regional allies which can make or break his coalition government – the Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh state and Janata Dal (United) in eastern Bihar state – were eyeing posts in important ministries, some of which the BJP have held so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the newly emboldened opposition ramped up pressure on Modi and the BJP. In a press conference, the Congress party's main campaigner Rahul Gandhi demanded a parliamentary investigation into what he called the “biggest stock market scam,” alleging that Modi and other top BJP ministers misled retail investors who ended up losing money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's two main benchmark stock indexes hit new highs on Monday after exit polls predicted a BJP sweep, but dropped sharply on Tuesday to close down more than 5% as early vote figures trickled in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In television interviews last month, Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah said the markets would surge when results were declared on June 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BJP denied Gandhi's accusations of a ploy between the party and exit pollsters, and accused the Congress leader of trying to discourage investors. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The British PM says that "on reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756562_1_20240607234949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak apologised on Friday for leaving D-Day commemorations in France early to return to the election campaign trail – a decision slammed as disgraceful by his political rivals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunak, who is fighting to keep his job in Britain’s July 4 election , said that, “on reflection” the decision was a mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak was not alongside leaders including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the major memorial event at Omaha Beach in Normandy on Thursday. Former Prime Minister David Cameron, who is now foreign minister, represented the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, the current favourite to win the election, attended and was pictured meeting Zelenskyy and other leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak had earlier attended a ceremony at the British memorial in Normandy alongside King Charles and surviving World War II veterans. He also attended a commemoration in Portsmouth, England, the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion that helped free Europe from the Nazis “should be about those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The last thing I want is for the commemorations to be overshadowed by politics.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: “On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer – and I apologise," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister recorded an interview with broadcaster ITV on Thursday after returning from France, though he said that was not the reason he cut short his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak insisted he “stuck to the itinerary” that had been laid out for him for D-Day weeks before he called the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On reflection it was a mistake not to stay longer and I’ve apologised for that, but I also don’t think it’s right to be political in the midst of D-Day commemorations," he said. "The focus should rightly be on the veterans and their service and sacrifice for our country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A clip released from the interview by ITV showed Sunak denying opposition allegations that he lied by making inaccurate statements about the opposition Labour Party’s tax plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said “Rishi Sunak will have to answer for his choice” to skip the D-Day event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me there was only one choice. ... There was nowhere else I was going to be," Starmer told broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said it was “a total dereliction of duty” for Sunak to skip the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nigel Farage, leader of the populist Reform UK party, said “patriotic people who love their country” should not vote for Sunak. Farage is seeking to siphon off Conservative voters with his populist, anti-immigration positions. He is sure to raise the D-Day episode in a seven-party televised debate later on Friday. All the main parties will be represented, though Sunak and Starmer are not due to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Craig Oliver, who was communications director to Cameron’s Conservative government, said “the problem for Rishi Sunak this morning is he’s accused of not getting what it is to be a prime minister and what his duties are as a prime minister.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All 650 seats in the House of Commons are up for grabs on July 4. The leader of the party that can command a majority – either alone or in coalition – will become prime minister. (AP)

    Starliner docks at ISS in spite of glitches

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's two-member Starliner crew received a warm welcome aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on Thursday after successfully docking, a key test of the new spacecraft's flight-worthiness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rendezvous was achieved despite an earlier loss of several guidance-control jet thrusters, some of them due to a helium propulsion leak, which Nasa and Boeing said had been partially fixed and should not compromise the mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CST-100 Starliner, with veteran astronauts Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams aboard, arrived at the orbiting platform after a flight of nearly 27 hours following its launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A live Nasa video feed showed the smiling new arrivals, wearing their blue flight suits, weightlessly floating headfirst through the padded passageway, one after the other, into the station. Williams was first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're just as happy as can be to be up in space," she said during a brief welcoming ceremony a short time later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Starliner autonomously docked with the ISS while both were orbiting some 250 miles over the southern Indian Ocean at 1.34 p.m. EDT, as the two vehicles soared around the globe in tandem at about 17,500 miles per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its US$4.2 billion, fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different US rides to the ISS.

    Cyril Ramaphosa says ANC wants national unity govt

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday that his African National Congress (ANC) would seek to form a government of national unity with a broad group of opposition parties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of the government of national unity must be, first and foremost, to tackle the pressing issues that South Africans want to be addressed," Ramaphosa said after a marathon ANC meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These issues include job creation and the growth of our economy that will be inclusive, the high cost of living, service delivery, crime and corruption," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In last week's general election, the ANC won just over 40 percent of the vote and 158 seats in South Africa's National Assembly, falling short of an outright majority for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Ramaphosa acknowledged after ten hours of intense talks with his party's senior members at a Johannesburg conference centre, the governing party now needs partners to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been speculation the party might seek to form a minority government or a coalition with one or two major parties, but in the end Ramaphosa invited all his rivals to talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such a national dialogue will enhance the pressing task of rebuilding social cohesion in a fractured society, following a particularly toxic and divisive election campaign," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa said ANC negotiators had already held talks with five parties: The leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), the National Freedom Party (NFP) and the anti-immigrant Patriotic Alliance (PA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All parties must commit to shared nation building and social cohesion," he said. "These values include respect for the constitution of the Republic of South Africa and the rule of law, social justice and equity, human dignity, non-racialism and non-sexism." (AFP)

    Boeing's space capsule springs more helium leaks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing’s space capsule developed more leaks during its first test flight with astronauts as it closed in on the International Space Station on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Starliner capsule already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit on Wednesday. Boeing and Nasa managers were confident they could manage the propulsion system despite the problem and that more leaks were unlikely. But just hours into the flight, two more leaks cropped up. There was no immediate word on the size of these new leaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaks pose no safety issues for Nasa test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams or the mission, Boeing spokesman Jim May said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mission managers pressed ahead for a midday docking with the space station while continuing to monitor the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  May said the capsule holds plenty of helium reserves to make up for what's lost. The propulsion system will be disabled once the capsule is docked at the space station since the thrusters will not be needed then, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Helium is used to pressurise the fuel lines of Starliner’s thrusters, which are essential for manoeuvering. Before liftoff, engineers devised a plan to work around any additional leaks in the system. A faulty rubber seal, no bigger than a shirt button, is believed responsible for the original leak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the space shuttles retired, Nasa hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX’s taxi service began in 2020. Boeing was supposed to start around the same time, but was held up for years by safety concerns and other troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing plans to keep Starliner at the space station for at least eight days before guiding it to a landing in the western US. (AP)

    Starship rocket splashes down in Indian Ocean

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The SpaceX Starship launching on its fourth flight test from Starbase in Texas. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756404_1_20240606223852.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX's giant Starship rocket survived reentry through Earth's atmosphere on Thursday and splashed down in the Indian Ocean as planned during its fourth test mission after launching from south Texas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-stage spacecraft, consisting of the Starship cruise vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, broke apart during its last attempt in March to survive a blazingly hot reentry through Earth's atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the craft survived its reentry on Thursday, a SpaceX livestream showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on social media after the splashdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starship, stacked atop its Super Heavy booster, blasted off on Thursday morning from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village on the Gulf Coast of Texas. It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, detached from the Starship upper stage three minutes into flight dozens of kilometres above ground, sending the Starship on its way toward space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Super Heavy headed back toward land and appeared to achieve a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 70-minute trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There, it began its free-fall back to Earth where it endured the intense heat of atmospheric reentry – the crucial point at which it failed in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Designed to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship – standing nearly 122 metres tall – represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by Nasa in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 40 kilometres above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating," Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by Nasa as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programmes, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon cancelled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties. (Reuters)

 World leaders on Thursday gathered in Normandy to remember those who fought and died on the beaches of northern France 80 years ago, when Allied forces launched "D-Day" to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Moving letters from veterans were read as ceremonies kicked off to mark the 80th anniversary of the June 6, 1944 D-Day landings, when more than 150,000 Allied soldiers invaded France by sea and air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US leader Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Britain's King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, representing the Allied powers, paid tribute to the tens of thousands of troops who fought on the beaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived to attend the ceremonies and hold talks with the leaders -- a stark reminder of the conflict between his country and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest guests of honour were some 200 surviving veterans in their late 90s or even over 100, some in wheelchairs, huddled in blankets as they gazed over the shores. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian officials on Thursday said an Israeli strike on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed up to 40 people, including 23 women and children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the UN school in Nuseirat had a hidden Hamas command post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people," Thawabta told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack happened after Israel announced a new military campaign in central Gaza as it battles a group of fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people died and more than 20 were injured when a passenger train collided with a freight train in the Czech city of Pardubice late on Wednesday, emergency and government officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least 20 people suffered light injuries and another three were more seriously hurt in the crash which occurred after 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) in Pardubice, along the country's main rail corridor from Prague to the east, Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The passenger train, operated by RegioJet, was travelling overnight from Prague to Kosice in eastern Slovakia, according to the Railway Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fire Rescue Services said more than 300 passengers were on board. Dozens of police, fire and emergency service units responded to the accident, helping evacuate carriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage after the crash on news website idnes.cz showed at least one carriage off the track, while police showed on their X social media account a line of emergency service vehicles and a helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech Television cited a fire brigade spokesperson saying the freight train was carrying calcium carbide, although the first two wagons were empty, so no leak occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Martin Kupka, who travelled with the interior minister to the crash site, told a televised briefing an investigation into the accident was beginning and it was too early to speculate on its cause. (Reuters)

    Boeing finally launches rival to SpaceX

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The CST-100 Starliner lifts off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756278_1_20240606034809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), following years of technical problems, delays and a 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad from Florida's Atlantic Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired its onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that will kick off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, the orbiting research outpost some 400 kilometres above Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will need to execute precise manoeuvres to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts - Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams - to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing wants the Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing wrote on social media that Starliner "has reached a safe, stable orbit on its Crew Flight Test" and is headed to the space station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Starliner ascends to the heavens," NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the US space agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nelson called the launch "a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth. (Reuters)

    Modi to be sworn in as Indian PM on Saturday

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hindu-nationalist party of Narendra Modi agreed with allies on Wednesday to form a government after a general election in which it failed to secure an outright majority for the first time in a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-member National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition -- led by Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- has 293 seats in parliament, giving it control of the legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all unanimously choose respected NDA leader Narendra Modi as our leader," a BJP-issued alliance statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the NDA government would "preserve India's heritage" and work for the "all-round development of the country".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election results released on Tuesday upended conventional wisdom throughout the six-week election that Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda would power him to a landslide win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said Modi's reliance on coalition partners means he faces the prospect of a far tougher-than-expected third term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will force Modi to take the point of view of others -- we shall see more democracy and a healthy parliament," said Nilanajan Mukhopadhyay, who has written a biography of Modi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will have to be a leader that he has never been; we will have to see a new Modi."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian media reports said Modi would be sworn in as prime minister on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China congratulated Modi earlier on Wednesday and said it was "ready to work" with its neighbour, while Japan also applauded the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, 73, insisted on Tuesday night that the election results were a victory that ensured he would continue his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our third term will be one of big decisions and the country will write a new chapter of development," Modi told a crowd of cheering supporters in the capital New Delhi after his win. "This is Modi's guarantee." (AFP)

    World's temperatures likely to breach 1.5 degrees: UN

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Climate change is taking a heavy toll around the world, fuelling extreme weather, flooding and drought. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756271_1_20240606021738.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Humanity now faces an 80 percent chance that Earth's temperatures will at least temporarily exceed the key 1.5-degree Celsius mark during the next five years, the UN predicted on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2015 Paris climate accords, which set the ambitious target of limiting the world to a temperature increase of 1.5 C over pre-industrial levels, meant to refer "to long-term temperature increases over decades, not over one to five years", the UN's World Meteorological Organization said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report came alongside another by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service announcing that last month was the hottest May on record, pointing to human-induced climate change -- and spurring UN chief Antonio Guterres to compare humanity's impact on the world to "the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chance of temporarily exceeding the limit in the next five years ahead has been rising steadily since 2015, when such a chance was estimated to be close to zero, the UN's weather and climate agency noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is an 80 percent likelihood that the annual average global temperature will temporarily exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for at least one of the next five years," WMO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, the risk of temporarily breaching the limit within five years was estimated at 66 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Already, dramatic climate shifts have begun taking a heavy toll worldwide, fuelling extreme weather events, flooding and drought, while glaciers are rapidly melting away and sea levels are rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are on a record-breaking warming path," WMO deputy chief Ko Barrett told reporters in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "WMO is sounding the alarm that we will be exceeding the 1.5 C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that "we have already temporarily surpassed this level for individual months".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barrett noted though that temporary breaches "do not mean that the 1.5 C goal is permanently lost because this refers to long-term warming over decades".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the trend is alarming and cannot be denied."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperature levels are rising, with 2023 by far the hottest year on record, amid warnings that 2024 could be even hotter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, the WMO predicts that the mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2024 and 2028 will be 1.1-1.9 C above the pre-industrial levels recorded between 1850 and 1900.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to repeated monthly temperature records over the past year, the WMO highlighted that already the past 12 months, from June 2023 to May 2024, were "the highest on record".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it said there was now an 86-percent chance that one of the years between 2024 and 2028 would unseat 2023 as the annual record-holder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said there was a 90-percent likelihood that the mean temperature for 2024-2028 would be higher than that over the past five-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are way off track to meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement," Barrett said. (AFP)

    Australia admits defeat in battle against X

    <![CDATA[<img alt="X, formerly Twitter, was criticised after video of an attack in a church spread widely on social media and sparked a riot. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756263_1_20240605234336.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's online watchdog on Wednesday dropped a legal effort to force Elon Musk's X to remove posts depicting the violent stabbing of a Sydney priest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have decided to discontinue the proceedings in the Federal Court against X Corp," eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog had ordered Musk's company to globally remove about 65 video and audio clips of the April 15 non-fatal attack in a church.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But X challenged the commission's right to make a global takedown order, arguing that geoblocking users in Australia was enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog had argued X's measures were easily dodged with the use of popular location-masking services like VPN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant -- a former Twitter employee -- defended the decision to take legal action: "I stand by my investigators and the decisions eSafety made."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our sole goal and focus in issuing our removal notice was to prevent this extremely violent footage from going viral, potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm on the Australian community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disputed posts showed Assyrian orthodox Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel being stabbed about six times during a live-streamed sermon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video of the attack, which spread widely on social media and sparked a riot by followers of the church in western Sydney, has been blamed by Australian authorities for feeding tensions in the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 16-year-old has been charged with "committing a terrorist act" in relation to the attack, which is said to have been religiously motivated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eSafety Commissioner said most Australians accepted that such graphic material should not be broadcast on television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This "begs an obvious question of why it should be allowed to be distributed freely and accessible online 24/7 to anyone, including children," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant said X routinely took down content globally, citing its removal of a compilation video of a knifeman's rampage in a Sydney shopping mall in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other major platforms had complied with the watchdog's requests and removal notices related to the church attack, she said, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, Snap, TikTok, Reddit and Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is because the video violated their terms of service and their standards of decency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inman Grant said she now "welcomed the opportunity" for a merits-based review of her decision by the country's Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her decision to drop the case followed a setback last month when the Federal Court refused to extend the order for a global ban while the court case was being fought. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain on Wednesday paid tribute to those who took part in D-Day, promising to "always remember" the sacrifices made by the Allied soldiers who invaded France by sea and air to drive out the forces of Nazi Germany in the World War II operation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With guests waving British flags, appearances from veterans, recollections and readings - and some tears in Queen Camilla's eyes - the British ceremony took place in Portsmouth, the main departure point for the 5,000 ships that headed to Normandy on June 6, 1944.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we come together to honour those nearly 160,000 British, Commonwealth and Allied troops who, on 5th June 1944, assembled here and along these shores to embark on the mission which would strike that blow for freedom and be recorded as the greatest amphibious operation in history," King Charles said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, as we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory, whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us, once again, commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day and to live up to the freedom they died for."
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigel Farage, new leader of Britain's right-wing Reform Party and thorn in the side of the governing Conservatives, was doused with a soft drink on Tuesday in his first full day of campaigning for a seat in parliament in the July 4 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Farage produced the biggest shock of the campaign by announcing he would head Reform and run in the election, a major blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, whose Conservative Party trails Labour badly in surveys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage is best known for helping to lead a successful campaign in 2016 for Britain to leave the European Union, and his popularity has put pressure on a succession of Conservative leaders to be tougher on immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly after he launched his campaign in the seat of Clacton-on-Sea, southeast England, a woman threw a large cup of soft drink over him as he left a pub, footage posted on social media showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He appeared unharmed as he was led away by security and later posed smiling in a video posted on X holding a McDonald's cup and joking: "My milkshake brings all the people to the rally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Tice, chairman of Reform, called the attacker a "juvenile moron", saying his party would not be intimidated and the incident would help it win hundreds of thousands more votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they had arrested a 25-year-old woman on suspicion of assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister James Cleverly condemned the incident as unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former commodities trader who is often pictured with a cigarette and pint of beer in hand, Farage has for three decades been the figurehead of euroscepticism in Britain, and is no stranger to controversy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charismatic and divisive, he has in the past made comments that his opponents have called racist. During the Brexit campaign, Farage appeared in front of a poster showing lines of migrants under the slogan "Breaking Point"; last month he said Muslims did not share British values.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was doused in milkshake in 2019 while campaigning for the Brexit Party, Reform's predecessor, in Newcastle before a European Parliament election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then, his attacker was ordered to pay for his suit to be cleaned after pleading guilty to common assault and criminal damage. (Reuters)

    Sunak, Starmer clash in first UK poll debate

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour challenger Keir Starmer went head-to-head on Tuesday over how to boost Britain's economy, with the PM accusing the opposition party of wanting to increase taxes if it wins power at a July 4 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both Sunak, a Conservative, and Starmer stuck to their campaign lines in their first debate just weeks before a general election opinion polls suggest Labour is set to win, with Sunak saying only he had a plan to spur Britain's paltry economic growth and Starmer portraying the Conservatives as presiding over 14 years of economic chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a heated debate – a recent feature in Britain and one which sees more voters tune into politics – the two leaders battled over how to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, growing waiting lists in the public health service and reducing immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the questions illustrated what many voters are contending with: a cost-of-living crisis when some struggle to pay their household bills, long waits for the health service and lower standards in the education system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Little new was gleaned from their answers, but an opinion poll taken immediately after the debate suggested Sunak had won the contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Keir Starmer is asking you to hand him a blank cheque when he hasn't said what he'll buy with it or how much it's going to cost you," Sunak said in his closing comments. "In uncertain times we simply cannot afford an uncertain prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer responded saying he would never offer "the gimmicks or unfunded promises that Rishi Sunak does".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Imagine how you would feel waking up on July 5 to five more years of the Conservatives, five more years of decline and division, the arsonists handed back the matches," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now imagine turning the page with a Labour government that rolls up its sleeves and gets on with the job... The choice at this election is clear: more chaos with the Conservatives or the chance to rebuild Britain with a changed Labour Party." (Reuters)

    No deal without permanent ceasefire: Hamas

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, speaks at a news conference. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756113_1_20240605025603.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas cannot agree to any deal unless Israel makes a "clear" commitment to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, a senior official from the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Qatar, which alongside the United States and Egypt has been mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, has also urged Israel to provide a clear position that has the backing of its entire government to reach a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot agree to an agreement that doesn't secure, guarantee, and ensure a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and completing a real serious swap deal accordingly," Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, told a televised press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-phase proposal presented by US President Joe Biden on Friday involved in its first phase a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from "all populated areas" of Gaza and some hostages – including the elderly and women – would be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under that plan, Hamas and Israel would negotiate in the same phase a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last "as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamdan said: "Israel only wants one phase where it takes all its hostages, then it resumes its aggression and war on our people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We ask mediators to get a clear position from the Israeli occupation to commit to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has previously said it viewed the contents of the proposal positively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States said on Sunday that if Hamas accepted the proposed plan it expected Israel to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third phase in the proposal would include a major reconstruction plan for the enclave, which has been devastated by eight months of war, and the return of the remains of dead hostages to their families.  (Reuters)

    Translator admits stealing US$17mn from Ohtani

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese baseball great Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty on Tuesday to stealing nearly US$17 million from the athlete's bank account to pay off his own gambling debts, according to US prosecutors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ippei Mizuhara, the onetime translator and de facto manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers' power-hitting pitcher, pleaded guilty in a deal that had been announced last month, a US Attorney spokesperson said. Sentencing will be on October 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was previously filed in US District Court in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offence punishable by up to three years behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly US$17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former interpreter's lawyer declined to comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ohtani, 29, whose talents as a slugger and a pitcher have earned him comparisons to Babe Ruth, has said he was an unwitting victim of theft and has never bet on baseball or knowingly paid a bookmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to prosecutors, Mizuhara began gambling with an illegal sports book in late 2021 and lost substantial sums.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cover his debts, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani over the phone on more than two dozen occasions to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. (Reuters)

    US sets new rules for migrants at Mexican border

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Migrants caught illegally crossing the US-Mexico border could be denied the chance to claim asylum and quickly deported or turned back to Mexico under new restrictions announced on Tuesday, part of a sweeping enforcement effort by US President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new measures will take effect immediately and will have exceptions for unaccompanied children, people who face serious medical or safety threats and victims of trafficking, a senior official said on a call with reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat, has toughened his approach to border security as immigration has emerged as a top issue for Americans in the run-up to November 5 elections where he will face/ Republican Donald Trump in a rematch of the 2020 contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new asylum restrictions are not permanent, the US official told reporters. They are activated when the daily average of border arrests tops 2,500 over a week and will be paused when arrests drop below 1,500 per day, the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deterrent measures "will significantly increase consequences for those who cross the southern border unlawfully," the official said, requesting anonymity as a condition of the call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key operational questions about how the new measures will be implemented remained unclear, however, including how the administration would quickly deport migrants from far-away and uncooperative countries and how many non-Mexican migrants Mexico would accept under the new enforcement regime.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="According to evening vote count trends, Modi's BJP has unexpectedly fallen short of a majority, raising its reliance on allies to be able to form the next government. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756092_1_20240604213123.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two key regional allies in Narendra Modi's coalition have endorsed him as India's next prime minister, their spokespeople said on Tuesday, after trends showed Modi's party was falling short of a majority in a general election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Janata Dal (United) said their pre-poll alliance with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)was intact and they would form the next government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their comments came after media speculation that the opposition alliance, which is doing much better than expected, was also in touch with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BJP is leading in 244 of the 543 seats in the directly elected lower house of parliament, according to evening vote count trends, unexpectedly falling short of a majority and raising its reliance on allies to be able to form the next government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  N Chandrababu Naidu's TDP, based in the southern coastal state of Andhra Pradesh, is currently the second-biggest party in Modi's National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the BJP. Naidu, who allied with the opposition the last time, has in the past spoken about loan waivers for farmers and privatisation of air and sea ports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "TDP has a pre-poll alliance with NDA and it will continue, no doubt about that," said party lawmaker K. Ravindra Kumar. "PM Modi and Naidu have congratulated each other."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party spokesperson Jyothsna Tirunagari said: "TDP has always shared a vision with PM Modi and he remains our PM face."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of the poor state of Bihar, has often switched sides and returned to Modi's alliance in January, having earlier helped form an opposition alliance of more than two dozen parties for the general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are formally with this NDA alliance and will participate in making the government," JD(U) spokesperson Abhishek Jha said. On being asked if the party would support Modi as NDA's prime minister, he said: "Definitely."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party focuses on issues of Bihar, especially for financial aid and investment to create jobs for its millions of young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These two allies ... need stability at the centre to run their own states, but they will take their own pound of flesh," said Yashwant Deshmukh, founder of polling agency CVoter. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korea is taking steps to suspend a contentious military agreement with North Korea and resume frontline military activities. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756051_1_20240604155852.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's military on Tuesday said it would resume all military activities along the demarcation line separating the two countries and the North West Islands after suspending an inter-Korean military agreement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspension of the military agreement with the North, which South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol approved earlier on Tuesday, was in response to North Korea's decision to send hundreds of balloons carrying trash over the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The South Korean military makes it clear that it will take all necessary measures to protect the lives and safety of its people in response to North Korea's provocations," a defence ministry official said in an emergency briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The large-scale spraying of filth balloons has "seriously threatened the safety of our people and caused property damage," the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang on Sunday said it had sent up 15 tonnes of wastepaper using 3,500 balloons, while Seoul vowed "unendurable" measures against the North in response, which could include blaring propaganda from loudspeakers directed at the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the military pact, both countries agreed to "completely cease all hostile acts against each other" that are the source of military tension and conflict, through measures such as the two sides ending military drills near the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the most substantive deal to come out of months of historic summit meetings between the two Koreas in 2018, but had been all but scrapped when Pyongyang declared last year it was no longer bound by it. (Reuters)

 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election on Tuesday, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls, TV channels showed.

  The early see-saw trends spooked markets with stocks falling steeply and the rupee also fell sharply against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, where 272 is a simple majority, in early counting at 2pm Hong Kong time. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's centrist Congress party was leading in over 220 seats, higher than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TV channels showed BJP accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, short of a majority on its own, compared to the 303 it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third Modi term with a slim majority for BJP – or having to depend on NDA allies for a majority – could introduce some uncertainty into governance as Modi has ruled with an authoritative hold over the government in the last decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, politicians and analysts said it was too early to get a firm idea of the voting trends since a majority of ballots were yet to be counted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a fair assessment to say 400 at the moment certainly looks distant," BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli told the India Today TV channel, referring to some projections that gave 400 seats to the NDA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we need to wait...to have a final picture of the seats because the exit polls speak of a massive sweep, [and] the counting trends currently don't seem to match that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The BJP-NDA will form the government, that trend is very clear from the start," he added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said on Monday that four more of the Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 have died in captivity and that their bodies are being held by the Islamist group.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The military identified the four men as Chaim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper, and Nadav Popplewell, all of whom were filmed alive in hostage videos posted by Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that new intelligence led to confirmation of their deaths. Hamas had posted a video of Popplewell last month and said that he had died of wounds sustained during an Israeli air strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We estimate the four of them were killed together in the area of (the southern Gaza city) Khan Younis a number of months ago while being held by Hamas terrorists, at the time IDF forces were operating in Khan Younis," Hagari said in remarks that were broadcast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are thoroughly examining the circumstances of their deaths and checking all possibilities. We will present soon the findings, first to their families, and then to the public," he said. "We will present them with transparency, as we have done until now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the more than 250 people abducted on October 7, about 120 remain in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Many have been declared dead by Israeli authorities. (Reuters)

    Brexit champion Farage to fight UK general election

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigel Farage, the colourful politician who helped champion Britain's departure from the European Union, said on Monday he would stand as a candidate in next month's election and will lead the Reform Party in a blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision by Farage, now a TV host and previously honorary president of Reform, will boost his movement's profile and challenge Sunak's governing Conservatives for the support of right-leaning voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage, 60, had previously said he would not stand in the July 4 vote in order to help his friend Donald Trump fight the US election later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I’ve decided I’ve changed my mind," Farage told a news conference. "It’s not always a sign of weakness, it could potentially be a sign of strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage has stood unsuccessfully for parliament seven times but is still one of the most influential British politicians of his generation, putting pressure on a succession of prime ministers to take tougher positions on Europe and immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the last general election in 2019, Farage's party decided not to contest seats held by the Conservatives, then led by Boris Johnson, to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls suggest the opposition Labour Party is on course for victory this time, with the Conservatives staring at one of the worst results in their history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support for Reform runs at about 10 percent nationally, giving the party the third highest vote share, polls show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But under Britain's winner-takes-all system, the party had not been expected to win any seats. (Reuters)

    Pakistan ex-PM Khan acquitted of leaking state secrets

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Imran Khan was convicted of making public a classified cable sent to Islamabad by Pakistan's ambassador in Washington in 2022. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755943_1_20240603205235.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan high court on Monday overturned a treason conviction against former prime minister Imran Khan, who remains in jail on other charges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The conviction was one of three slapped on Khan in the runup to February elections, which he claims were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision by a two-member bench at Islamabad High Court was announced by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the first big case which was part of the political victimisation against Imran Khan and Shah Mahmood Qureshi which has been dashed to the ground," Salman Safdar, a lawyer for Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan was convicted along with Qureshi, his former foreign secretary, of making public a classified cable sent to Islamabad by Pakistan's ambassador in Washington in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had touted the cypher as evidence that the United States had conspired to force him from power in 2022, when a no-confidence vote saw him replaced by the opposition. The United States and Pakistan's military have denied the accusation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan remains jailed on a seven-year sentence for breaking Islamic law by marrying his wife Bushra Bibi too soon after her divorce. He has also been found guilty of graft over gifts he received in his time as premier between 2018 and 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While his 14-year sentence was suspended in April, the conviction still stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan was ousted by a parliamentary no-confidence vote after falling out with the top generals, and in opposition he waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts regard Pakistan as a "hybrid regime", where the military establishment wields immense power to determine the course of ostensibly democratic politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan later found himself tangled in more than 200 court cases, massively complicating his attempts to mount a comeback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite that, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party in the February elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A broad coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military kept the MPs from power. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Results on Monday showed Claudia Sheinbaum was elected Mexico's first woman president by a landslide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Electoral Institute announced after a quick count that Sheinbaum won around 58 to 60 percent of the vote, more than 30 percentage points ahead of her main opposition rival Xochitl Galvez, also a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum later announced that her opponents had conceded the race to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victory for Sheinbaum was a major step for Mexico, a country known for its macho culture and home to the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, which for years pushed more traditional values and roles for women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum was also the first woman to win a general election in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election was also the biggest in the country’s history. More than 20,000 congressional and local positions were up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum has a complicated path ahead. She must balance promises to increase popular welfare policies while inheriting a hefty budget deficit and low economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has vowed to improve security but has given few details while the election was the most violent in Mexico's modern history with 38 candidates murdered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many analysts say organised crime groups expanded and deepened their influence during outgoing President Lopez Obrador's term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More people have been killed - over 185,000 - during the mandate of Lopez Obrador than during any other administration in Mexico's modern history, although the homicide rate has been inching down. (Agencies)

    Trump warns jail time could be 'breaking point'

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Donald Trump says he is "not sure the public would stand for it" if he is given a custodial sentence. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755828_1_20240603023212.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has warned that it could prove to be a "breaking point" for his supporters if he is sentenced to prison or house arrest following his historic criminal conviction.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview aired on Sunday on Fox News, the former president and current Republican White House hopeful acknowledged the possibility that he could be handed jail time or a period of home detention at his sentencing on July 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm ok with it," Trump said, but added he was "not sure the public would stand for it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it would be tough for the public to take. You know at a certain point there's a breaking point," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The warning will resonate in a country already concerned about the prospect of political violence in the increasingly heated run-up to the November 5 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump will now be running as a convicted felon, and he has repeatedly made it clear he will not accept the result should he lose to President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A New York jury on Thursday convicted Trump on all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in the final stages of the 2016 presidential campaign to cover up a sex scandal involving adult film star Stormy Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first criminal conviction of a former president in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although each charge carries a possible four-year jail term, experts say it is extremely unlikely that the judge will actually hand down a custodial sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump faces three other criminal trials, including one related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election he lost to Biden. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexicans voted on Sunday in a presidential election dominated by two women – an historic first in a country with a history of gender-based violence and discrimination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of troops were expected to be deployed to protect voters, following a particularly bloody electoral process that has seen more than two dozen aspiring local politicians murdered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruling party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum, a former Mexico City mayor and a scientist by training, had a 17 percentage point lead over her main opposition rival Xochitl Galvez on the eve of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only man running, centrist Jorge Alvarez Maynez, was trailing far behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means that, barring a huge surprise, a woman is almost certain to break the highest political glass ceiling in Mexico, where around 10 women or girls are murdered every day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A female president will be a transformation for this country, and we hope that she does more for women," said Clemencia Hernandez, a 55-year-old cleaner in Mexico City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many women are subjugated by their partners. They're not allowed to leave home to work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mariana Nieves, a 28-year-old designer, said a lot of younger Mexicans were fed up with politicians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we have to vote because we're hopeful of something good for Mexico in security, education. I'm happy that a woman is going to win but I'm not very excited because I think neither of them has coherent proposals" on improving women's rights, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 100 million people were registered to vote in the world's most populous Spanish-speaking country, home to 129 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum, 61, owes much of her popularity to outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a fellow leftist and mentor who has an approval rating of more than 60 percent but is only allowed to serve one term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a nation where politics, crime and corruption are closely entangled, ultra-violent drug cartels have gone to extreme lengths to ensure that their preferred candidates win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours before polls opened, a local candidate was murdered in a violent western state, authorities said, joining at least 25 other political hopefuls killed this election season, according to official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel Delgado, 35, was shot on Saturday night near his home, the Michoacan state prosecutor's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another sign of the difficulties of staging elections in cartel hotspots, voting was suspended in two southern municipalities because of violence, local authorities said on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fight against organised crime will be the biggest challenge for the next president," said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University, in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security was the weakest point of Lopez Obrador's administration, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheinbaum has pledged to continue the outgoing president's controversial "hugs not bullets" strategy of tackling crime at its roots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Galvez has vowed a tougher approach to cartel-related violence, declaring "hugs for criminals are over."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 450,000 people have been murdered and tens of thousands have gone missing since the government deployed the army to fight drug trafficking in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next president will also have to manage delicate relations with the neighbouring United States, in particular the vexed issues of cross-border drug smuggling and migration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing a cheering crowd of thousands at her closing campaign rally, Sheinbaum said Mexico was going to "make history" this weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I say to the young women, to all the women of Mexico – colleagues, friends, sisters, daughters, mothers and grandmothers – you are not alone," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ruling party candidate had the backing of 53 percent of voters as campaigning drew to a close, according to a poll average compiled by research firm Oraculus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Galvez, an outspoken senator and businesswoman with Indigenous roots, was second with 36 percent. Maynez, 38, had just 11 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Galvez, 61, often evokes her childhood story of growing up in a poor, rural town in central Mexico where she says she sold candy to help her family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While you danced ballet at the age of 10, I had to work," she told Sheinbaum, a former student activist who was born in the capital to a family of Jewish immigrants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While millions of Mexicans have escaped poverty in recent years, more than a third still live below the poverty line in Latin America's second-biggest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as voting for a new president, Mexicans will choose members of Congress, several state governors and myriad local officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, more than 20,000 positions are being contested. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian police have arrested one of Thailand's "most wanted" fugitives who was on the run after escaping custody in Thailand last year, a senior police official said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chaowalit Thongduang, 37, was arrested in the Indonesian resort island of Bali on Thursday, said Wahyu Widada, the head of Indonesia's criminal investigation agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fugitive who was secured is one of the most wanted fugitives by Thailand authorities because (he) had committed many crimes before eventually fleeing to Indonesia to hide," Wahyu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chaowalit, also known by the moniker "Pang Na Node," was wanted on multiple charges including murder and drug-related offences, according to Phanurat Lukboon, secretary general of Thailand's narcotics control board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He entered Indonesia in December 2023 after a 17-hour journey by speedboat, Wahyu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that police seized several pieces of evidence, including a fake identity card and birth certificate under the name of Sulaiman, which was allegedly used by Chaowalit, and an Indonesian bank account book.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Phanurat thanked Indonesia for arresting Chaowalit, adding that Thai authorities are further investigating the case.

  <br/>
  "When Chaowalit comes here, there must be someone who helped him enter Indonesia. Now we are investigating to know who is the mastermind behind all this," Phanurat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chaowalit escaped from a hospital in southern Nakhon Si Thammarat province while he was serving a 20-year sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December last year, the Bangkok Post reported that he had been sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment in an attempted murder case dating back to 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of police officers were mobilised to recapture him, in an operation reported to have cost around 10 million baht (US$271,816).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chaowalit is expected to be extradited to Thailand on Tuesday, said Krishna Murti, who heads the Indonesian police's international relations division. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Official results from South Africa's election were expected to confirm on Sunday the end of the African National Congress' 30 years of majority governing and start the clock on a race to form a new ruling coalition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Voters, angry at joblessness, inequality and power shortages, slashed support for the ANC – the former liberation movement of the late Nelson Mandela – to 40 percent in Wednesday's election, down from 57.5 percent in the 2019 parliamentary vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means it must now share power, likely with a major political rival, in order to keep it – an unprecedented prospect since the end of white minority rule in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the official announcement of results expected on Sunday evening, political parties will have two weeks to work out a deal before a new parliament sits to choose a president, who would likely still emerge from the ANC as the biggest party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ANC is committed to the formation of a government that reflects the will of the people, that is stable and that is able to govern effectively," Fikile Mbalula, the party's secretary general, said at a press briefing on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the ANC would be having discussions both internally and with other parties to create national and provisional governments "that reflect the will of the people and that are able to take the country forward".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said that the ANC would not bend to pressure from other parties that incumbent President Cyril Ramaphosa must step down as a condition for forming a coalition. "That is a no-go area," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC's performance has fuelled speculation that Ramaphosa's days might be numbered, either due to the potential demands of a prospective coalition partner or as a result of an internal leadership challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Counting from the May 29 poll was almost complete on Sunday morning, with results in from 99.9 percent of polling stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Wednesday, the ANC had won every national election by a landslide since 1994, but over the last decade its support has dwindled as the economy stagnated, unemployment rose and roads and power stations crumbled. (Reuters)

    Heatstroke kills 33 Indian polling staff

    <![CDATA[<img alt="There have been reports of multiple deaths from the intense heatwave – with temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius in many places.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 33 Indian polling staff died on the last day of voting from heatstroke in just one state, a top election official said on Sunday, after scorching temperatures gripped swathes of the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While there have been reports of multiple deaths from the intense heatwave – with temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius in many places – the dozens of staff dying in one day marks an especially grim toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The India Meteorological Department said temperatures at Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh reached 46.9 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Navdeep Rinwa, chief electoral officer for the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where voting in the seventh and final stage of elections ended on Saturday, said 33 polling personnel died due to the heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure included security guards and sanitation staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A monetary compensation of 1.5 million rupees (US$18,000) will be provided to the families of the deceased," Rinwa told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts say that when a person is dehydrated, extreme heat exposure thickens their blood and causes organs to shut down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rinwa reported a separate incident in which a man queueing to vote in the city of Ballia lost consciousness while waiting in line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The voter was transported to a health facility, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival," Rinwa said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India is no stranger to searing summer temperatures, but years of scientific research have found climate change is causing heatwaves to last longer, and be more frequent and more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hindu-nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks set to win a third straight landslide election victory after voting ended on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exit polls showed he was well on track to triumph and Modi himself was certain he had prevailed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results will be formally announced on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 New York police arrested at least 22 people after pro-Palestinian protesters picketed New York's Brooklyn Museum, charging some with offenses including assault, officers said on Saturday, with the gallery reporting damage to artwork.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of demonstrators had descended on the art museum on Friday, chanting pro-Palestinian slogans, and carrying banners and placards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While many remained outside, some entered the museum, with a giant black and white banner reading "Free Palestine, divest from genocide" unfurled above the museum facade's six distinctive columns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested were accused of offences ranging from assaulting police officers, resisting arrest and riding a bicycle on the sidewalk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lesser action was taken against seven others, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, there was damage to existing and newly installed artwork on our plaza, and our public safety staff were physically and verbally harassed," said a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Museum, confirming that the site was closed early on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US universities were rocked by pro-Palestinian demonstrations in April, triggering campus clashes with police and the arrest of dozens of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations began at Columbia University in New York and later spread across the country as well as to Europe and elsewhere. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea has sent around 600 more trash-filled balloons containing everything from cigarette butts to plastic across the border, Seoul's military said on Sunday, adding that security personnel were collecting them as they landed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "North Korea has resumed launching waste balloons towards South Korea," since around 8pm Saturday evening, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of around 10am Sunday, "approximately 600 balloons have been identified, with about 20 to 50 balloons per hour moving through the air," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The balloons are landing in South Korea's northern provinces, including the capital Seoul and the adjacent area of Gyeonggi, which collectively are home to nearly half of the South's population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea began sending hundreds of balloons carrying bags of trash earlier this week, which Seoul has slammed as "low-class", warning of strong countermeasures unless Pyongyang stops such "irrational" provocations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the campaign started on Tuesday, some 900 balloons have been launched, the JCS said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far, they have been found to contain "waste such as cigarette butts, scrap paper, fabric pieces, and plastic," it said, adding that "no hazardous substances have been found."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our military is conducting surveillance and reconnaissance from the launch points of the balloons, tracking them through aerial reconnaissance, and collecting the fallen debris, prioritising public safety," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We urge the public to avoid contact with the fallen waste balloons and report them to the nearest military unit or police station," it added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters in Tel Aviv are hoping the Israeli government will accept President Biden's proposal. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755749_1_20240602042102.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two far-right Israeli ministers threatened on Saturday to quit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhau's government if he goes ahead with a hostage release deal outlined by US President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden said on Friday that Israel had offered a new roadmap towards a full ceasefire including the release of hostages held by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said they would quit his government if the deal went ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir said his party would "dissolve the government" if the deal went through and slammed the proposal as "a victory for terrorism and a security risk to the State of Israel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Agreeing to such a deal is not total victory – but total defeat," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smotrich said he would "not be part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We demand the continuation of the war until Hamas is destroyed and all hostages return," Smotrich said on X, adding that he opposes the return of displaced Gazans to the territory's north and the "wholesale release of terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Saturday, Netanyahu insisted that the destruction of Hamas was part of the Israeli plan laid out by Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid vowed to offer Netanyahu "our safety net for a hostage deal if Ben Gvir and Smotrich leave the government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without Ben Gvir's and Smotrich's parties, Netanyahu's coalition could lose its majority in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of Israelis meanwhile rallied in Tel Aviv to demand acceptance of the ceasefire and hostage release deal outlined by Biden, with many fearing the premier would disown the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope that somehow Biden puts enough pressure so the government and Netanyahu will take the deal," said protester Diti Kapuano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 36,379 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israeli bombardments and ground offensive since October 7, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run territory. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexico's election is now the bloodiest in its modern history after a candidate running for local office in central Puebla state was murdered on Friday at a political rally, taking the number of assassinated candidates to 37 ahead of Sunday's vote.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jorge Huerta Cabrera, a candidate who was running for a council seat in the town of Izucar de Matamoros, was gunned down in the attack, according to the state prosecutor's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing takes the number of assassinated candidates in the 2024 election season to 37, one more than during the 2021 midterm election when 36 candidates were killed, according to data from security consultancy Integralia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of violent crime has emerged as one of the top issues in this year's presidential contest, in which the ruling party of outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been forced to defend a persistently high murder rate, as the opposition has sought to use the bloodshed to argue for change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruling party hopeful Claudia Sheinbaum is widely expected to win Sunday's vote and become Mexico's first female president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's possible that violence is being used as a means to define the election in advance, particularly when certain interests are perceived to be at risk in the event that a particular political project triumphs," said Armando Vargas, an Integralia researcher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultancy has also counted 828 non-lethal attacks on candidates during the current election season, up from 749 since just Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts point to Mexico's mix of powerful drug cartels and often corrupt local governments as contributing to the dangers faced by candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, a local mayoral candidate in southern Guerrero state was gunned down at point-blank range during a campaign rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was among 560 candidates and election officials who have been given security guards by the government due to persistent threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday's grisly assassination was captured on video, with mayhem erupting at the rally after the shots rang out. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A last-minute problem nixed Saturday’s launch attempt for Boeing’s first astronaut flight, the latest in a string of delays over the years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two Nasa astronauts were strapped into the company’s Starliner capsule when the countdown was automatically halted at 3 minutes and 50 seconds by the computer system that controls the final minutes before lift off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With only a split second to take off, there was no time to work on the latest issue and everything was called off. It was not immediately clear why the computers aborted the countdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launch controllers were evaluating the data, said United Launch Alliance’s Dillon Rice. But it is possible the team could try again as soon as Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams remained in their capsule seats, as they waited for technicians to help them get out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first launch attempt on May 6 was delayed for leak checks and rocket repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa wants a backup to SpaceX, which has been flying its astronauts for four years. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cyril Ramaphosa's ANC has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755735_1_20240601214128.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC faced a search for allies to help it form a new government on Saturday after it lost its three-decade-old absolute majority in a watershed election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With 99 percent of the votes from Wednesday's election counted, President Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress had only 40 percent, a catastrophic slump from the 57.5 it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks an historic turning point for South Africa as the party has enjoyed an absolute majority since 1994, when liberation leader Nelson Mandela led the nation out of white-minority rule and into democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC must now either negotiate a coalition government, or at least persuade other parties to back Ramaphosa's re-election in parliament to allow him to form a minority government reliant on other parties for support to pass budgets and legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been talking with everybody even before the election," ANC's deputy secretary general Nomvula Mokonyane said, saying the party's NEC decision-making body would meet to decide on a course of action after final results are announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's about ensuring that the stability both in government and stability in our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She would not be drawn on whether the party might replace Ramaphosa after the party's record poor showing, saying: "For now, it's not an issue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As votes continued to be validated, data from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) showed the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) held second place with 21.71 percent, slightly up on its 20.77 showing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party, which governs Western Cape province and has promised a free market agenda at odds with the ANC's left-wing traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the chances of a coalition with the ANC, Helen Zille, the DA party chairwoman, said: "Negotiations haven't started but some channels have been opened, individuals talking to individuals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also did not rule out allowing the ANC to attempt to rule alone, saying: "A minority government would be something completely new in South Africa but it is an option amongst others."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was not a surge by the DA that cut into the ANC's vote share.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In third place was former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) on 12.6 percent, a surprise score for a party founded just months ago as a vehicle for the former ANC chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was in fourth with 9.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malema and Zuma are former ANC members and some observers have suggested that they would be more natural partners for the ruling coalition, a prospect that the DA has branded the "Doomsday Coalition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But other analysts, including author Susan Booysen, said the EFF was perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma – who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018 – was "too far reaching" to mend, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MK spokesman Nhlamulo Ndhlela seemed to agree. "We will engage with the ANC but not the ANC of Cyril Ramaphosa," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any coalition partner should be willing to amend the constitution to enact radical reforms and grant Zuma, who has been declared ineligible over a contempt of court conviction, a pardon, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC retains the loyalty of many voters for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs. (AFP)

    India's six-week election ends with vote in holy city

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's marathon election drew to a close on Saturday six weeks after voting began, with voters enduring a scorching heatwave to cast their ballots in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long been widely expected to win a third term when results are announced on Tuesday, in large part due to his cultivated image as an aggressive champion of India's majority faith.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exit polls – though historically unreliable at capturing voter shifts in an election with 968 million eligible voters – are expected to give some initial indication of whether he has succeeded later on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many in the 73-year-old premier's constituency of Varanasi were eager for that to be the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I voted for growth and development of my country," said local resident Brijesh Taksali outside a polling station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's only one leader that I know... Narendra Modi. I voted for him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Varanasi is the spiritual capital of the Hindu faith, where devotees from around India come to cremate deceased loved ones by the Ganges river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is one of the final cities to vote in India's gruelling election, and where public support for Modi's ever-closer alignment of religion and politics burns brightest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi has already led the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to two landslide victories in 2014 and 2019, forged in large part by his appeal to the Hindu faithful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, Modi presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque in Ayodhya razed by Hindu zealots in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction of the temple fulfilled a longstanding demand of Hindu activists and was widely celebrated across the country with back-to-back television coverage and street parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony, and numerous other chest-beating demonstrations of fidelity to India's majority religion over the past decade, have made many among the country's 200 million-plus minority Muslim community increasingly uneasy about their futures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi himself has made a number of strident comments about Muslims on the campaign trail, referring to them as "infiltrators."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has also accused the motley coalition of more than two dozen opposition parties contesting the poll against him of plotting to redistribute India's wealth to its Muslim citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Janesar Akhtar, a Muslim clothesmaker working in Varanasi's famed embroidery workshops, said that the BJP's sectarian campaigning was an unfortunate distraction from India's chronic unemployment problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Workshops here are closing down and the Modi government has been busy with the politics of temples and mosques," the 44-year-old said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is supposed to give us jobs and not tensions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have long expected Modi to triumph against the opposition alliance, which at no point has named an agreed candidate for prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His prospects have been further bolstered by several criminal probes into his opponents and a tax investigation this year that froze the bank accounts of Congress, India's largest opposition party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western democracies have largely sidestepped concerns over rights and democratic freedoms in the hopes of cultivating an ally that can help check the growing assertiveness of China, India's northern neighbour and rival regional power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's image at home has been bolstered by India's rising diplomatic and economic clout – the country overtook Britain as the world's fifth-biggest economy in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an Indian, I feel that he has ensured a lot of respect and prestige for India during his term," Shikha Aggarwal, 40, said while waiting to cast her vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People now look at India and Indians with a lot more respect, something not accorded earlier."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India has voted in seven phases over six weeks to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turnout is down several percentage points from the last national election in 2019, with analysts blaming widespread expectations of a Modi victory as well as successive heatwaves scorching India's northern states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in the eastern state of Bihar said on Friday that 10 poll workers had died of heatstroke the previous day while setting up for the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extensive scientific research shows climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent and more intense, with Asia warming faster than the global average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A scorching sun bore down on Varanasi and its countless temples and riverside crematoriums during Saturday's vote, with afternoon temperatures peaking at 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last few days have been very tough," housewife Bindwasvini Devi, who voted soon after polls opened to beat the scorching temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've tried to stay hydrated and avoided going out as much as possible." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Prabowo Subianto speaks at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755709_1_20240601155803.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's president-elect, Prabowo Subianto, said on Saturday that his country was willing to send peacekeeping troops to enforce a ceasefire in Gaza if required.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security conference, Prabowo said US President Joe Biden's three-phase proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza was a step in the right direction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When needed and when requested by the UN, we are prepared to contribute significant peacekeeping forces to maintain and monitor this prospective ceasefire as well as providing protection and security to all parties and to all sides," Prabowo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 72-year-old former special forces general and current Indonesian defence minister takes on the presidency of the world's most populous Muslim nation in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said President Joko Widodo had instructed him to announce that Indonesia was also ready "to evacuate, to receive and to treat with medical care up to 1,000 patients" from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Indonesia Hospital in Gaza, which was run by an Indonesia NGO, closed in November amid the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo said a comprehensive investigation into the humanitarian disaster in the Rafah area of Gaza was needed as well as a "just solution" to the situation in Palestine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And that means the rights of not only Israel to exist, but also the rights of the Palestinian people to have their own homeland, their own state, living in peace." (Reuters)

 Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa cancelled his "dearMoon" mission, which the project said was to have been the first private flight around the moon, the mission announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The team had originally aimed to make the circumlunar flight, with celebrities on board, by the end of last year but that became "unfeasible", the mission said in a statement on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Without clear schedule certainty in the near-term, it is with a heavy heart that Maezawa made the unavoidable decision to cancel the project," it said. "To all who have supported this project and looked forward to this endeavor, we sincerely appreciate it and apologize for this outcome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement did not give further details on the cause of the cancellation. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean defence minister Shin Won-sik said on Saturday that more evidence suggests weapons used by Russia in the war in Ukraine were illegally imported from North Korea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Military cooperation between Russia and North Korea" is escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and "also affecting the battlefield in Europe", Shin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If North Korea continues to receive military technology transfers from Russia in return, a significant improvement in North Korea's conventional military capability is an imminent risk, Shin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On questions about whether South Korea may seek nuclear weapons of its own, Shin said that South Korea trusts the global nonproliferation treaty (NPT) regime, and that a stronger US-South Korean alliance is the answer to North Korea's nuclear development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shin was speaking during the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's biggest defence forum, under way in Singapore. The event ends on June 2. (Reuters)

    Questioning Trump guilty verdict 'dangerous': Biden

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday that it was "dangerous" for people to question the integrity of the guilty verdict in Donald Trump's hush money jury trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his first public comments since a New York jury on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts over a payment to silence an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election, Biden, a Democrat, struck out hard at Trump and other Republicans who have criticised the verdict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself." Biden said. He noted that the case against Trump in New York was brought by the state, that it was not a federal case, and that the verdict was delivered by "a jury of 12 citizens, 12 Americans, 12 people like you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US justice system has endured for nearly 250 years, Biden said, and he criticised Trump and his supporters for attempting to tear it down with false allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's reckless, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In rambling remarks earlier on Friday at the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan, Trump repeated his complaints that the trial was an attempt to hobble his comeback White House bid and said it showed that no American was safe from politically motivated prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone," Trump said in an unscripted 33-minute speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's guilty verdict catapults the United States into unexplored territory ahead of the November 5 vote, when Trump, 77, will try to win back the White House from Biden, 81. (Reuters)

    Biden says Israel offers new roadmap to end Gaza war

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The US president has urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755636_1_20240601031825.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Israel was offering a new roadmap towards a full ceasefire in Gaza that he urged Hamas to accept, saying it's "time for this war to end."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's intervention, which had been heavily trailed, came as Israeli troops pushed into central Rafah, escalating its nearly eight-month war with Hamas despite international objections to any assault on the south Gaza city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came as top diplomat Antony Blinken acknowledged that despite US efforts to get more aid into Gaza, the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory remained "dire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first major address outlining how the Gaza war might end, Biden said that Israel's three-stage offer would begin with a six-week phase that would see Israeli forces withdraw from all populated areas of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also see the "release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, in exchange for (the) release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and the Palestinians would then negotiate during those six weeks for a lasting ceasefire – but the truce would continue while the talks remained underway, Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US president urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's time for this war to end, for the day after to begin," he said, adding: "We can't lose this moment" to seize the chance for peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After successive rounds of indirect negotiations in recent months all failed, Hamas said earlier on Friday that it had informed mediators it would only agree a "comprehensive" truce including a hostage-prisoner swap if Israel halts its "aggression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's Qatar-based political office, accused Israel of "using negotiations as a cover to continue its aggression," saying Hamas "refuses to be a part of these manoeuvres."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas since the Palestinian militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel sent tanks and troops into Rafah in early May, ignoring concerns over the safety of displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering in the city on the Egyptian border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, soldiers were operating in the city centre where they uncovered rocket launchers and tunnel shafts and dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility, the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A stream of civilians has flooded out of Rafah, taking their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering in the city. Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged on Friday that the humanitarian situation was "dire" despite US efforts to bring in more assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Food Programme said daily life had become "apocalyptic" in parts of southern Gaza since Israel began its assault on Rafah in early May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency was able to provide "ever decreasing amounts of assistance," with all of its bakeries in Rafah closed due to a lack of fuel and supplies, its director for the Palestinian territories, Matthew Hollingworth, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan announced it will host a summit on June 11, jointly organised with Egypt and the United Nations, bringing together aid agency chiefs and heads of donor governments to discuss the humanitarian response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas released a video on Telegram on Friday featuring the audio of a woman's voice, who they said was one of the hostages. The audio file could not immediately be verified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,284 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on track on Friday to score its worst electoral result ever, with the latest tallies showing voters deserted the party in droves and ended its 30-year political dominance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The African National Congress (ANC) is now all but certain to fall below 50 percent of the vote, forcing the party to seek a coalition partner to have enough backing to name a president and form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks an historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, as the party has enjoyed an absolute parliamentary majority since 1994, when its then leader Nelson Mandela led the nation out of white minority rule and into democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With more than two thirds of the votes cast in Wednesday's general election counted, the ANC remained in the lead but with a score below 42 percent, compared to the 57 percent it won in 2019 and far off the 62 percent secured by Mandela in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As votes continued to be validated, data from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) showed the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) held second place with 22.64 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was not a surge by the DA that cut into the ANC's vote share.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In third place was former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) on 12 percent, a surprise score for a party founded barely six months ago as a vehicle for the former ANC chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected at the weekend, but with the trends clear and the votes stacking up on the IEC website, politicians and pundits were turning their attention to the prospects of an ANC-led coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party, but if the latest, President Cyril Ramaphosa, is to remain at the helm he will have to decide whether to seek allies on his right or his left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be resistance within his movement to a tie-up with the second-placed DA, under white politician John Steenhuisen, whose pro-free market programme of privatisation and an end to black economic empowerment programmes is at odds with the ruling party's traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there will also be reluctance to invite Zuma, who left government facing a raft of corruption allegations, or firebrand Julius Malema's radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) into government after both fought bitter campaigns against their former party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC retains the loyalty of many voters for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts expect the party to patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups, especially as the Zuma's MK has stormed to victory in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The MK has really eaten into the ANC's vote," said Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, like analyst and author Susan Booysen, said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma – who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018 – was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might instead prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But another outside observer, political analyst and business leader Sandile Swana, argued that Ramaphosa's authority had take such a beating in the election that he would not be able to push reluctant party bigwigs to accept a DA alliance. "His power is gone within the ANC," he said. (AFP)

    Blinken says Gaza situation 'dire' despite aid efforts

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged on Friday that the humanitarian situation was "dire" in Gaza as Israel pushes in deeper, despite US efforts to bring in more assistance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken spoke a day after USAID chief Samantha Power quoted aid workers as saying that the "conditions are worse now than ever before" in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The humanitarian situation remains dire for people in Gaza," Blinken told reporters in Prague when asked about Power's remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've seen changes – some positive changes – but the net effect is not there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken added that while the number of aid trucks entering Gaza was up "significantly," distribution remained difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed to the impact of Israeli military operations around the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah and the closure of the Rafah border into Egypt after Israel seized control of the crossing from the Hamas militant group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're not just measuring inputs, we're measuring impact. And yes, the impact remains insufficient in terms of addressing the acute needs of children, women and men in Gaza," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has pursued military operations in Rafah despite a warning from President Joe Biden, though the White House says the assault is smaller than the type of massive operation which he had called unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has built a temporary pier into Gaza at a cost of at least US$320 million, but it was damaged in poor weather, suspending deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,2844 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday said it would be "difficult" for it to take part in a planned conference on the war in Ukraine in June if Russia did not attend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine is trying to whip up attendance at the peace conference in Switzerland, where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged China to take part but Beijing insisted any summit would need the participation of Russia, which Ukraine has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing believes the conference "should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans", foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace," she said. (AFP)

    'Unlikely the Republican Party will abandon Trump'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political scholar on Friday said it was unlikely the Republican Party would abandon Donald Trump as its presumptive presidential nominee.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The former president was convicted in an historic criminal case of falsifying business records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Wong, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and fellow at the Centre on Contemporary China and the World at the University of Hong Kong, said Trump retains strong support from his party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said that Trump's conviction may affect independent voters in swing states, but he didn't think it would benefit his challenger, President Joe Biden, a great deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no reason to think that Trump is therefore ineligible. And that's because the US Constitution has only three requirements when it comes to eligibility for candidacy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One, the candidate must be at least 35 years old. Secondly, they must be a natural born US citizen. And thirdly, they must have lived in the US for at least 14 years. There's no stipulation that they must not have a criminal record. So this will not affect his nominal and technical eligibility to run as a candidate should the Republican National Convention decide that is indeed to be the case."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitors to Spain's Madrid Zoo Aquarium were on Thursday introduced to a giant panda couple from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Male Jin Xi and female Zhu Yu, both born in 2020, arrived last month at the zoo following the renewal of its agreement for giant panda protection with the China Wildlife Conservation Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed a smooth quarantine period before making their debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sofia, the former queen of Spain, hosted the official introduction of the three-year-old bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are proud to host this unique species and to contribute to its preservation," Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Ambassador to Spain, Yao Jing, highlighted that "the friendly bond" created by the pandas would unite the two peoples and serve as "an important symbol of China-Spain friendship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the debut of the giant panda couple, visitors to the zoo can now participate in educational activities every weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We try to bring information about pandas to the public so they can know pandas better and how we can protect the species," zoo staff Luis Manchado, who is responsible for the educational section, told Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two pandas are set to remain in Spain for the next 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has loaned its treasured bears to overseas zoos over the years as goodwill ambassadors, while also running conservation programmes back home that have seen their status improve from endangered to vulnerable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are 728 pandas in zoos and breeding centres around the world.

    Trump convicted on all charges in hush money trial

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Should Donald Trump win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755463_1_20240531051916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New York jury convicted Donald Trump on all charges in his hush money case on Thursday in a seismic development barely five months ahead of the election where he seeks to recapture the White House.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic first criminal trial of a former US president ended with the 77-year-old Trump found guilty on each of the 34 charges of falsifying business records to hide a payment meant to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, who is all but certain to appeal, did not immediately react, but sat still, his shoulders dipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conviction thrusts the United States into uncharted political territory but does not bar Trump from a White House run, even in the unlikely event that Judge Juan Merchan sentences him to prison time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict comes just weeks before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is due to receive the party's formal nomination to face Democratic President Joe Biden on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12-member jury deliberated for more than 11 hours over two days at the end of the extraordinary five-week trial held in a drab Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a US$130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election, when her claim to have had sex with him could have proved politically fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial featured lengthy testimony from the adult performer, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and who described to the court in graphic detail what she says was a 2006 sexual encounter with the married Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors successfully laid out a case alleging that the hush money and the illegal covering up of the payment was part of a broader crime to prevent voters from knowing about Trump's behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's defence attorneys had countered that "trying to influence an election" was simply "democracy" and that the former president did nothing wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial has distracted Trump from his campaign to unseat Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he milked the media attention throughout, with daily speeches in front of the cameras outside the courtroom in which he complained about being a political victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identities of the 12 jurors deciding the case were kept secret, a rare practice more often see in cases involving mafia or other violent defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After teasing the prospect for weeks, Trump – who denied ever having sex with Daniels at a 2006 celebrity golf tournament – opted not to testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican, who made his name as a brash real estate mogul before a stunning ascent to the nation's highest office in the 2016 election, now faces prison or, more likely, probation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In theory, he could face up to four years in jail for each count of falsifying business records but legal experts said as a first-time offender he is unlikely to go behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An appeal could take months to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Should he win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself, given that the case was not brought by the federal government but by the state of New York, where only the governor could clear his name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also faces federal and state charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden, and for hoarding secret documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

    ANC on track to lose majority after South Africa vote

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Cyril Ramaphosa was all smiles after casting his ballot at a polling station in Soweto. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755457_1_20240531031603.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on course to lose its 30-year-old parliamentary majority on Thursday, opening the prospect that the party that defeated apartheid will have to share power for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With a third of votes in Wednesday's election tallied, the ANC was leading but with a score of only 42 percent – well below the 57 percent it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Followed by the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) on 25 percent. The leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and former South African president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) were neck and neck on around nine percent each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected in the next three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The broad church of the ANC has taken a substantial knock. This is a shock to the system for the ANC and ultimately will also be a shock to the system for the average South African, who has only known ANC rule since 1994," said political analyst Daniel Silke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It redraws the political boundaries of South Africa and creates a degree of uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If President Cyril Ramaphosa's party is confirmed as dropping below 50 percent, it would force him to seek coalition partners to be re-elected to form a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would be a historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, which was underlined by newspaper headlines on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SA on the cusp of shift in politics," read the front page of daily BusinessDay. "The people have spoken," headlined The Citizen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party remains respected for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule, and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people in power are hopefully going to come down and we will have a new political party," Shaun Manyoni, a 21-year-old student, said in Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa's opponents from both the left and the right came to the polls on Wednesday hoping either to replace the ANC with an opposition alliance or force the party to negotiate a coalition agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Zuma ran this country perfectly ... so let's put him back and let South Africa run again," said Don Naidoo, a middle-aged small business owner from the province's largest city of Durban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voting was marked by hours-long queues in many districts, which in some cases forced polls to remain open well beyond closing time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) said a last-minute rush in urban voting and high turnout were to blame for the late finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost all votes had been counted by 3:00 pm on Thursday, but most had yet to be validated, IEC's head Sy Mamabolo told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While, the process was "proceeding well," officials said they expected it would take longer than the usual 24 hours to reach an 80 percent tally, due to delays caused by the new three-ballot system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the ANC gets close to 50 percent it could shore up a majority by allying itself with some of the four dozen smaller and regional parties contesting the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this appeared increasingly unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts were split on who the ANC would prefer as bedfellows and on whether the poor performance threatened Ramaphosa's leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His power is gone within the ANC," said analyst Sandile Swana, predicting that the party would patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups led by former ANC figures: firebrand Julius Malema's EFF or Zuma's MK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a major upset, the latter was leading with 43 percent of preferences in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, a key electoral battleground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg said MK was a natural partner for the ANC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have similar policies and similar tendencies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analyst and author Susan Booysen said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma, who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018, was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's parliament gave the final green light to a controversial amnesty bill for Catalan separatists on Thursday, paving the way for the return of their figurehead Carles Puigdemont after years of self-imposed exile.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislation seeks to draw a line under years of efforts to prosecute those involved in the botched 2017 Catalan independence bid that triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The text, which has been resolutely opposed by Spain's right and far-right opposition, passed by 177 votes in favour to 172 votes against in the 350-seat parliament. One person was absent from the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing the amnesty is a key moment for Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, as it was a demand made by separatist parties in exchange for their parliamentary support to allow him to serve a new term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, Spain's lower house of parliament passed the bill, which grants an amnesty to hundreds of separatists involved in Catalonia's failed 2017 independence bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It then went to the Senate upper house, which is dominated by the right-wing opposition, where it was symbolically vetoed – as the Senate cannot block a bill, but only propose amendments – before returning to the lower house on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a rowdy two-and-a-half hour debate during which the Speaker was forced to call order several times due to the insults traded on the floor, the bill passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will now be up to individual judges to decide whether the amnesty applies to their cases. They have two months to raise issues with the Constitutional Court or the European justice system which could delay the law's implementation for some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest beneficiary will be Puigdemont – the former Catalan leader who led the bid then fled Spain to avoid prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His hardline separatist JxCat and its moderate rival ERC both demanded the amnesty in return for their votes in November that let Sanchez secure another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What opened that door was Spain's inconclusive July 2023 election, which was won by the right-wing Popular Party (PP) but without enough parliamentary support to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With JxCat cast as kingmaker, Sanchez won them over with the promise of an amnesty and returned to office, in a move sparking fierce and unrelenting opposition from the PP and the far-right Vox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have drawn thousands onto the streets in mass protests against the bill that at times turned violent, notably around the Socialists' Madrid headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, a PP spokesman said that even after it passes, the party would do everything to "overturn" the law, whether through appeals to the Constitutional Court or "social pressure" on the street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surveys suggest Spaniards are divided over the amnesty, even Sanchez's own Socialists and their supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the outcome of Catalonia's regional election on May 12, in which the Socialists won a clear victory, has shifted the picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The separatists lost their absolute majority in the Catalan parliament after 10 years in power, suggesting the focus has shifted away from independence, vindicating Sanchez's strategy of seeking to defuse tensions around the 2017 crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader of the Socialist Party's Catalan branch, Salvador Illa, is hoping to lead the region's new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results show that Catalonia has chosen "the path of forgiveness, giving up any kind of resentment," Sanchez said in Barcelona last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Puigdemont, whose party increased support during the vote and has said he wants to lead a minority separatist administration, is hoping to be home back in time to see a new Catalan government take office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the date has not yet been set, it is expected to take place by June 25 at the latest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is unclear whether that will be possible, given the two month time span for the courts to enact the legislation, which involves releasing those behind bars and cancelling outstanding arrest warrants, including the one for Puigdemont. (AFP)
