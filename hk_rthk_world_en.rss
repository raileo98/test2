<div class="itemFullText">
 The Slovak interior minister on Thursday said that a “lone wolf” had been charged with attempted murder in the shooting that seriously wounded Prime Minister Robert Fico.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fico was in serious but stable condition on Thursday, a hospital official said, after the populist leader was hit multiple times in an attempt on his life that shook the small country and reverberated across the continent weeks before European elections.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The attempted assassination shocked the small central European nation, with many blaming the attack in part on extreme political polarisation that has divided the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Interior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok on Wednesday said that an initial investigation found “a clear political motivation” behind the attack on Fico while he was attending a government meeting in a former coal mining town. However, he clarified this on Thursday, saying the suspect charged was a lone wolf who “did not belong to any political groups". (AP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753383_1_20240516135013.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday took back a lecture hall from pro-Palestinian protesters who for hours occupied the building at the University of California, Irvine, then cleared a student encampment that stood for more than two weeks, witnesses said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers from about 10 nearby law-enforcement agencies converged on the campus after university officials requested help because protesters had occupied the lecture hall, leading the school to declare it a "violent protest," police and university officials said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About four hours later, police had ejected the protesters from both the lecture hall and the plaza that had been the site of the encampment, according to the university and Reuters witnesses.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The police have retaken the lecture hall," UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich said by telephone from the scene. "The plaza has been cleared by law-enforcement officers."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vasich said there were a "minimal number of arrests" and characterised the protesters as "begrudgingly cooperative."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The university said all classes would be held remotely on Thursday, asking employees not to come to campus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The demonstration at Irvine, about 65km south of Los Angeles, is the latest in a series of campus protests across the United States over the war in Gaza in which activists have called for a ceasefire and the protection of civilian lives while demanding universities divest from Israeli interests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UC Irvine protesters had established an encampment adjacent to the lecture hall on April 29 similar to those at other universities that have led to mass arrests and clashes with police elsewhere in the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Wednesday, 200 to 300 protesters took over the lecture hall at a time when no classes were in session, Vasich said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police responded in riot gear and formed a barricade while an officer on a loudspeaker warned the crowd that they had formed an unlawful assembly and risked arrest if they remained, the Orange County Register reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Students chanted slogans, banged drums and hoisted banners, with rows of police standing nearby, Reuters witnessed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One banner hung from the building declared the site "Alex Odeh Hall," in honor of a Palestinian activist who was killed in a 1985 office bombing in the nearby city of Santa Ana.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Four adjacent research buildings with potentially hundreds of people inside were locked down, and those inside were instructed to shelter in place, Vasich said, though the university later altered that instruction and instead advised them to leave.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shortly before nightfall, police moved in on the lecture hall, then engaged in a tense standoff with protesters at the encampment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Helmeted police wielding batons formed a line against protesters. Police gradually moved forward, pushing the students back every few minutes, until the officers rushed the crowd and made more arrests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Before long most demonstrators had retreated, police held the otherwise empty plaza strewn with trash, and a few onlookers remained at the periphery. (Reuters)

    Canada wildfire doubles in size as thousands flee

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Residents of Fort McMurray head away from their fire-threatened homes. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753344_1_20240516093213.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A wildfire in Canada's major oil-producing region doubled in size as it drew closer to the city of Fort McMurray on Wednesday, but officials were hopeful shifting winds could soon push it away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The blaze scorched almost 21,000 hectares of forest overnight as it came within 4.5 kilometres of the city, which was partly evacuated the day before.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alberta Wildfire spokeswoman Christie Tucker told a briefing that cooler temperatures and calmer winds were expected to "push the fire away from Fort McMurray" as well as weaken it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis urged residents to "remain vigilant," noting that "wildfire conditions can change and deteriorate rapidly."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For many, the fire has brought back terrifying memories of 2016 when a massive blaze gutted Fort McMurray, forcing its entire population of more than 90,000 to flee at a moment's notice.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm sure these memories will create fear and uncertainty for many in Fort McMurray and my sympathy is with everyone facing this situation, but safety must remain our top priority," said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, after 6,000 residents of four neighborhoods were ordered out on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Many stores and schools were closed as a haze blanketed the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Freddy Saulnier, 51, who recently moved to Fort McMurray from New Brunswick on the Atlantic coast, says he is living "a nightmare."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Staying in a hotel room after being ordered to leave his home, he says he can smell the smoke. This fire "is a beast," he said. "It's almost like watching a horror movie, you don't know if the killer is hiding behind a tree, and it's eerily quiet at night."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After being pulled from the front lines the day before, firefighters were back on Wednesday along with water bombers dropping retardant, while heavy equipment operators built fire guards southwest of the town.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Canadian authorities have been bracing for another possibly devastating wildfire season, after the country's worst-ever last year saw flames burning from coast to coast and charring more than 15 million hectares of land. (AFP)

    Biden, Trump to hold first presidential debate in June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CNN will host the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753306_1_20240516001511.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to hold a first presidential debate in June after the Democratic incumbent challenged his rival to "make my day" and the scandal-plagued Republican quickly responded he was ready to "rumble."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CNN announced it will hold the first debate on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Biden proposed a second debate for September and Trump accepted.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden, 81, had set out his own terms for the debates with political showman Trump, such as time limits for speakers and having no live audience – a condition CNN said it had agreed to.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In his first formal debate offer after months of stalling, the Democrat also shunned the traditional calendar proposed by the commission that has run debates since 1988 as he sought to exercise control over the format.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump, 77, accepted the dates even as he set out a starkly different vision with a larger venue for "excitement purposes" and accused the Democrat of being afraid of crowds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hasn't shown up for a debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal," Biden said in a video on X.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'll even do it twice."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden also trolled Trump over his ongoing criminal hush money trial in New York, which features a mid-week break, adding: "So let's pick the dates Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CNN said in a statement that the debate would be held at its studios in Atlanta in the "crucial battleground state of Georgia."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "To ensure candidates may maximise the time allotted in the debate, no audience will be present. Moderators for the debate and additional details will be announced at a later date," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden's debate offer appeared to show him taking the calculated risk of putting Trump back into American living rooms ahead of November's election, hoping it could reverse the Republican's poll lead in a series of battleground states.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden campaign has increasingly been trying to remind voters of what they say is the true face of the mercurial president who lost in 2020, amid what they fear is Trump "nostalgia" in some quarters – even as the Republican details his stark vision for an authoritarian second term in various interviews.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For his part, Trump has previously said he would debate his rival "anytime, anywhere" as he seeks to portray Biden as old and incapable of leadership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After Biden's challenge, Trump – who avoided any debates with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination this year – said he was "ready to Rumble!!!" for the proposed June and September debates. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Security officers bundle Slovak PM Robert Fico into a car after the assassination attempt. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753303_1_20240515231847.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia Prime Minister Robert Fico was on Wednesday shot multiple times and rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries after a cabinet meeting, officials said, in an attack condemned by EU chiefs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fico, a populist leader accused of being Kremlin-friendly, has been prime minister since last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Today, after the government meeting in Handlova, there was an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Robert Fico," the government said in a post on social media.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "He is currently being transported by helicopter to Banska Bystrica in a life-threatening condition, because it would take too long to get to Bratislava due to the necessity of an acute intervention," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fico was shot multiple times, said a post on his official Facebook page.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We confirm the attack on the prime minister," police spokesman Matej Neumann said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Handlova local hospital director Marta Eckhardtova said "Fico was brought into our hospital and he was treated at our vascular surgery clinic."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She was unable to describe his injuries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dennik N daily said its reporter heard several shots fired and then saw security guards lift the premier off the ground and into a car.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The newspaper also reported that police had detained the suspected gunman.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Slovak President Zuzana Caputova said she was "utterly shocked by today's brutal and reckless attack on Slovakia's prime minister... which I condemn in (the) strongest possible terms."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I wish him a lot of strength in this critical moment and early recovery," she said on X, formerly Twitter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also called the news of the attack "shocking."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I hope the prime minister will get well as soon as possible. We must not tolerate violence, it must have no place in society," he said on X.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: "Robert, my thoughts are with you in this very difficult moment."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As well as his current stint as premier, Fico also headed the government in 2006-10 and 2012-18.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since he was elected last October, Fico has made a string of remarks that have soured ties between Slovakia and neighbouring Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He has notably questioned Ukraine's sovereignty and called for a compromise with Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also sparked mass protests with controversial changes, including a media law that critics say will undermine the impartiality of public television and radio.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a press conference following the shooting, MP Lubos Blaha from Fico's Smer party lashed out against his critics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "You, the liberal media, and progressive politicians are to blame. Robert Fico is fighting for his life because of your hatred," Blaha said. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753258_1_20240515150608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers raced on Wednesday to find dozens of people still unaccounted for after flash floods and cold lava flow that inundated neighbourhoods and swept away houses over the weekend left 67people dead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hours of torrential rain on Saturday caused mud and rocks to flow into districts near one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes, sweeping away dozens of houses and damaging roads and mosques.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The national disaster agency chief Suharyanto on Wednesday said dozens remained missing, with the figure increasing periodically.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rescuers said many of the retrieved bodies were found in or around nearby rivers after locals were swept away by the deluge of volcanic material, mud and rain that tore through neighbourhoods.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Heavy equipment was deployed to clear debris from the areas worst hit by flooding, which has affected transport access in six districts, said Suharyanto, who goes by one name.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 3,300 people have been forced to evacuate from affected areas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 To aid the rescue effort, authorities on Wednesday deployed weather modification technology, the term Indonesian officials use for cloud seeding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In this case, it is being used in a bid to make clouds rain earlier so the rainfall's intensity is weakened by the time it reaches the disaster-struck area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indonesia is prone to landslides and floods during the rainy season.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2022, about 24,000 people were evacuated and two children were killed in floods on Sumatra island, with environmental campaigners blaming deforestation caused by logging for worsening the disaster.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trees act as a natural defence against floods, slowing the rate at which water runs down hills and into rivers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden's administration informed Congress on Tuesday of a $1 billion weapons package for Israel, official sources told AFP, a week after threatening to withhold some arms over concerns of a Rafah assault.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The administration informally notified the weapons package to Congress, which will need to approve it, a US official said, while a congressional aide who also requested anonymity said the weapons bought from US weapons makers amounted to around $1 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The weapons would come out of a major $95 billion package recently approved by Congress in defense support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and the Biden administration has repeatedly said it planned to go ahead and appropriate the funds through purchases from US manufacturers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the deal comes a week after Biden warned he may withhold bombs and artillery shells to Israel if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went ahead in defiance of US warnings with an assault on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than one million Palestinians have taken shelter after half a year of war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden administration also confirmed last week that for the first time it had halted a shipment including 2,000-pound bombs, fearing they would be used with devastating risks for civilians in Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Congress could still block the weapons sale to Israel, with left-leaning members of Biden's Democratic Party outraged by the toll on civilians in the Gaza war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the overall package passed despite opposition from the left, with the rival Republican Party almost unanimously in support of arms for Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Wall Street Journal first reported the new arms package. It said it could potentially include $700 million in tank ammunition and $500 million in tactical vehicles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Biden administration, while increasingly critical of Israel, has made clear it will continue to support its ally's security and pointed to US assistance last month in shooting down Iranian drones launched in retaliation for a strike on a diplomatic facility.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are continuing to send military assistance, and we will ensure that Israel receives the full amount provided in the supplemental," Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, told reporters on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs because we do not believe they should be dropped in densely populated cities. We are talking to the Israeli government about this," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since the October 7 Hamas attack that triggered the massive Israeli retaliation, the Biden administration has twice cited emergency needs to avoid the regular 30-day review by Congress of military transfers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Critics also point out that the Biden administration has sent a regular flow of weapons unknown to the public as they fall below the threshold for congressional notification. (AFP)

    Riots rock France's New Caledonia over voting reform

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French MPs attend a debate on the constitutional bill aimed at enlarging the electorate of the overseas French territory of New Caledonia, at the French National Assembly in Paris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753219_1_20240515095233.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person was killed, hundreds more were injured, shops were looted and public buildings torched during a second night of rioting in New Caledonia, authorities said on Wednesday, as anger over constitutional reforms from Paris boiled over.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protests against the reform turned violent Monday night, with shots fired at security forces, vehicles torched and shops looted in the worst unrest the French overseas territory has seen since the 1980s.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In response, authorities deployed a heavy security contingent, imposed a curfew, banned public gatherings and closed the main airport.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "More than 130 arrests have been made and several dozen rioters have been taken into custody and will be brought before the courts," the French High Commission of the Republic in New Caledonia said in a statement early Wednesday morning.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Describing the "serious public disturbances" as ongoing, the High Commission decried widespread looting and torching of businesses and public property, including schools.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added that classes will remain scrapped until further notice and the main airport shut to commercial flights.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The unrest flared as lawmakers in France debated a bill that would increase the number of people eligible to cast ballots in the territory's provincial elections, a change critics fear could marginalise Indigenous people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Following lengthy and at times tense debates, the National Assembly in Paris adopted the reform shortly after midnight, by 351 votes to 153.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Afterwards, French President Emmanuel Macron appealed for calm on all sides.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the Noumea Accord of 1998, France vowed to gradually give more political power to the Pacific island territory of nearly 300,000 people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Under the agreement, New Caledonia has held three referendums over its ties with France, all rejecting independence. But independence retains support, particularly among the Indigenous Kanak people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Noumea Accord has also meant that New Caledonia's voter lists have not been updated since 1998 -- meaning that island residents who arrived from mainland France or elsewhere in the past 25 years do not have the right to take part in provincial polls.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The French government has branded the exclusion of one out of five people from voting as "absurd", while separatists fear that expanding voter lists would benefit pro-France politicians and reduce the weight of the Kanaks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai rights activist detained on royal defamation charges died on Tuesday while on hunger strike in custody, the kingdom's department of corrections said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Netiporn Sanae-sangkhom, an activist from the pro-democracy "Thaluwang" group, had been held in pre-trial detention since January.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She was charged under Thailand's tough royal insult laws over a royal motorcade protest in 2020 during the peak of the kingdom's youth-led pro-democracy movement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some of the world's strictest lese-majeste laws protect King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family, with each offence carrying a potential 15-year sentence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 28-year-old went on hunger strike shortly after detention to protest against the Thai justice system, and was immediately transferred to the medical correctional hospital over health concerns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the statement released by the department of corrections, Netiporn – also known by her nickname "Boong" – suffered from weak legs and arms as well as anaemia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She refused "minerals and vitamins" given by the hospital, the statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "She had a cardiac arrest on Tuesday morning and wasn't responsive to the treatment, which led her to die peacefully at 11:22 am (0422 GMT)," the statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added that the hospital will conduct an autopsy to identify the cause of death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Southeast Asian regional branch of the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said it was "deeply disturbed" by Netiporn's death.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We call for transparent & impartial investigation into her death & care. Freedom of expression & peaceful assembly are fundamental rights," the office wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the Human Rights Lawyer Association, there are at least two political prisoners in Thailand who went on hunger strike.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2023, two Thai hunger strikers held under royal insult law were given temporary release over health concerns. (AFP)

    Palestinians rally at historic villages in Israel

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people took part on Tuesday in an annual march through the ruins of villages that Palestinians were expelled from during the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wrapped in keffiyeh scarves and waving Palestinian flags, men and women rallied through the abandoned villages of Al-Kassayer and Al-Husha – many holding signs with the names of dozens of other demolished villages their families were displaced from.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Your Independence Day is our catastrophe," reads the rallying slogan for the protest that took place as Israelis celebrated the 76th anniversary of the proclamation of the State of Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The protest this year was taking place against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Gaza, where fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas has displaced the majority of the population, according to the United Nations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among those marching on Tuesday was 88-year-old Abdul Rahman al-Sabah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He described how members of the Haganah, a Zionist paramilitary group, forced his family out of Al-Kassayer, near the northern city of Haifa, when he was a child.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They "blew up our village, Al-Kassayer, and the village of Al-Husha so that we would not return to them, and they planted mines," he said, his eyes glistening with tears.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The family was displaced to the nearby town of Shefa-Amr.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But we continued (going back), my mother and I, and groups from the village, because it was harvest season, and we wanted to live and eat," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We had nothing, and whoever was caught by the Israelis was imprisoned."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Palestinians remember this as the "Nakba", or catastrophe, when around 760,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the war that led to the creation of Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The descendants of the 160,000 Palestinians who managed to remain in what became Israel presently number about 1.4 million, around 20 percent of Israel's population. (AFP)

    Georgia passes so-called 'foreign influence' bill

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Georgian police were out in force to stop protesters interrupting the passage of the bill. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753183_1_20240515002412.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia's parliament on Tuesday adopted a controversial "foreign influence" law that has sparked weeks of mass protests against the measure, which Brussels has warned would undermine Tbilisi's European aspirations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmakers voted 84 to 30 in favour during the third and final reading of the law, which was widely denounced as mirroring repressive Russian legislation used to silence dissent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The vote came as street protesters skirmished with riot police outside the building in the centre of the capital, where demonstrations have taken place over the last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Scuffles had broken out inside the chamber earlier as opposition lawmakers clashed with members of the ruling Georgian Dream party.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Critics say the bill is a symbol of the ex-Soviet republic's drift closer to Russia's orbit over recent years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Around 2,000 mainly young protesters gathered outside parliament and chanted "no to the Russian law," as news spread that lawmakers had adopted the law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tbilisi has seen weeks of mass rallies over the bill that culminated on Saturday, when up to 100,000 people took to the streets in the largest anti-government rally in Georgia's recent history.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EU has said the law is "incompatible" with Georgia's longstanding bid to join the 27-nation bloc, while Washington has warned its adoption would signal Tbilisi's departure from the Western orbit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The US Assistant Secretary of State, James O'Brien, on Tuesday met in Tbilisi with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, whose office said each had "expressed their concerns" over recent developments in Georgia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UK Secretary of State for Defence, Grant Shapps, labelled the foreign influence law an act of "Russian interference in Georgia."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov hit back, accusing the West of "undisguised interference in Georgia's internal affairs."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said that he would be travelling on Tuesday to Georgia together with his counterparts from Iceland, Estonia and Latvia to express "our concerns."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Both protesters and the ruling Georgian Dream party have vowed not to back down and fresh rallies have been called.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some protesters say their ultimate goal is to vote out Georgian Dream, which has been in power since 2012.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bill requires NGOs and media outlets that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as bodies "pursuing the interests of a foreign power."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Russia has used a similar law to silence public figures and organisations that disagree with or deviate from the Kremlin's views.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The EU on Tuesday repeated its position that the bill undermines Tbilisi's desire to move closer to the bloc.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "EU member countries are very clear that if this law is adopted it will be a serious obstacle for Georgia in its European perspective," said its spokesman, Peter Stano.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, Georgia was granted official EU candidacy, and Brussels is set to decide in December on the formal launch of accession talks – an unlikely prospect after the law's adoption.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with the government, has vowed to veto the law, though Georgian Dream has enough lawmakers in parliament to override her veto.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This law is taking away my future," 19-year-old protester Anano Plievi said outside parliament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am angry, and proud of all these people at the same time. We are going to keep going towards Europe."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian society is staunchly anti-Kremlin. Georgia's bid for membership of the EU and NATO is enshrined in its constitution and – according to opinion polls – supported by a majority of the population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 NGOs and government critics have reported months of intimidation and harassment in the run-up to the bill being reintroduced in a targeted campaign that has escalated amid the tensions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian Dream has depicted the protesters as violent mobs, insisted it is committed to joining the EU, and said the bill is aimed at increasing transparency of NGO funding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The controversy surrounding the bill comes five months before a parliamentary election seen as a crucial democratic test for the Black Sea country. (AFP)

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Kremlin also confirmed the trip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit meant to reassure Ukrainians of continued American support and flow of weapons as Russia pummels the northeastern Kharkiv region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marking his fourth visit to Kyiv since the start of the war in February 2022, Blinken arrived by overnight train from Poland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Blinken will aim to reassure Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of enduring American support and deliver a speech focused on Ukraine's future.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kyiv has been on the back foot on the battlefield for months as Russian troops have slowly advanced, mainly in the Donetsk region to the south, taking advantage of Ukraine's shortages of troop manpower and artillery shells.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Russia's forces hold a significant advantage in manpower and munitions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Monday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Washington was trying to accelerate "the tempo of the deliveries" of weapons to Ukraine to help it reverse its disadvantage. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel battled Hamas in Gaza on Monday, including in far-southern Rafah, despite US warnings against a full-scale invasion of the crowded city and of the threat from post-war anarchy or insurgency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Clashes also raged in northern and central Gaza as Israel marked a sombre Memorial Day, followed by Independence Day from Monday night, more than seven months into the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israelis marked a moment's silence and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that "our war of independence is not over yet. It continues even today... We are determined to win this struggle."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 AFP correspondents in Gaza reported helicopter strikes and heavy artillery shelling in the east of Rafah, as well as battles in northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp and Gaza City's Zeitun neighbourhood.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel last week defied a chorus of warnings -- including from top ally Washington which paused a shipment of bombs -- and sent tanks and troops into the east of Rafah to pursue militants.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The city on the Egyptian border had been sheltering 1.4 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations, but Israel's military operation sparked an exodus of nearly 360,000 people from Rafah so far, said the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agency warned that "no place is safe" in the territory, much of which has been reduced to a grey landscape of rubble.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Washington had not seen any credible Israeli plan to protect civilians in Rafah, and that "we also haven't seen a plan for what happens the day after this war in Gaza ends".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Israel's on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas," he told NBC. (AFP)

    Cohen testifies against former boss in New York

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Michael Cohen, the star prosecution witness in the criminal trial of Donald Trump walks to court to testify. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753032_1_20240514004135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's one-time fixer and the star prosecution witness in the former president's historic criminal trial testified on Monday that he lied and bullied for his former boss who looked on silently.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Michael Cohen's testimony followed last week's court proceedings in which adult film star Stormy Daniels gave toe-curling detail about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump which is at the heart of the case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump, 77, is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer Cohen for a hush-money payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, when the story could have proved politically fatal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen if, as a lawyer-fixer for the property tycoon, he lied and bullied people on behalf of Trump.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Yes... It was what was needed in order to accomplish the task," said Cohen who periodically glanced over at Trump who was slouched in his chair at the defendant's table.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cohen spent just over 13 months in jail and a year and a half under house arrest after he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for lying to Congress and financial crimes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the first weeks of the trial in New York, jurors have heard from witnesses that Cohen was a difficult character who cajoled others to get his way, while the defence counsel have painted him as a pathological liar and convicted criminal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cohen testified on Monday that he worked on both personal and corporate issues for Trump, who he claimed did not have an email address for fear of leaving a paper trial that could be used to prosecute him.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daniels, who claims to have had sex with Trump in 2006, has denied she threatened him if he did not buy her silence for US$130,000, a payment that prosecutors say Trump then covered up.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The trial is taking place six months before the November election, when Trump will try to defeat Democratic President Joe Biden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During nearly eight hours over two days last week, Daniels walked the jury through the one-night stand she said she had with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament, and then the financial settlement she says ensued.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump had sat impassively for much of Daniels's testimony, apparently cursing at times, and railing against proceedings in his comments to reporters as he entered and left the Manhattan courtroom.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump has denied having sex with Daniels, and his lawyers asked the judge for a mistrial on the grounds her testimony was "extremely prejudicial" in what is essentially a financial records and election-related case.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Judge Juan Merchan denied two mistrial requests last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Merchan has imposed a gag order on Trump prohibiting him from publicly attacking witnesses, and the ex-president -- who has traded insults with Daniels for years, calling her "horseface" and other crude slurs -- has not commented directly on her testimony.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump spoke at a rally on a beach in New Jersey on Saturday and condemned the judge as "conflicted" and the prosecutor in the case, Alvin Bragg, as a "radical Democrat."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But he appeared to heed the gag order and avoided naming any witnesses in the case, including Cohen.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He has also been charged in Florida with allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House but that case has been postponed indefinitely. (AFP)

    Banks 'light the flame of the climate crisis'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Public concern over climate change has grown over recent years, but a new report says banks are still funding fossil fuels. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753031_1_20240514003047.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's biggest banks financed fossil fuels to the tune of US$705 billion in 2023, with US and Japanese lenders leading the way, an annual report by climate campaigners said on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the top 60 banks have provided a total of US$6.9 trillion to the sector, according to the coalition's 15th annual report titled "Banking on Climate Chaos".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Financiers and investors of fossil fuels continue to light the flame of the climate crisis," said Tom BK Goldtooth, executive director of Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the report's authors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last year's fossil fuel funding was down 9.5 percent from 2022, the report said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But some banks increased their exposure to climate risk, it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 JPMorgan was the top financier last year, providing US$41 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from 2022, according to the report.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Japan's Mizuho moved up to second place with US$37 billion, followed by Bank of America at US$33.7 billion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As one of the world's largest financiers to both traditional and clean energy companies, we help power today's global economy," said a JPMorgan Chase spokesperson in response.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We believe our data reflects our activities more comprehensively and accurately than estimates by third parties. Reflecting our strategy of supporting the build-out of zero-carbon power, we set a net-zero aligned Energy Mix target and will disclose a clean energy supply financing ratio." (AFP)

    Rishi Sunak defends beleaguered Tories' track record

    <![CDATA[<img a="" alt="British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says he's " confident"="" consecutive="" fifth="" his="" in="" office.="" party="" photo:="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" reuters"="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753030_1_20240514002111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto" term="" win="" would=""/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted on Monday that his beleaguered governing Conservative party can win a general election despite polls consistently indicating the opposite, but refused to set a date for the vote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sunak mounted a defence of the Tories' 14 years in power and claimed that Britain would be less safe under Keir Starmer's Labour opposition, which is widely tipped to come back to power.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The UK leader said he was "confident" his party would win a fifth consecutive term but conceded that Labour, out of government since 2010, may ultimately inflict defeat.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm clear-eyed enough to admit that, yes, maybe they can depress their way to victory," Sunak said in a speech in central London, accusing Labour of "scaremongering" and "gaslighting".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But I don't think it will work because at heart we are a nation of optimists," he added, before warning of several dangers himself.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sunak cited Russia's war in Europe, Iran's firing of missiles in the Middle East and the uncertainty posed by artificial intelligence as threats that needed to be tackled.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also referred to "authoritarian" states, including and North Korea, Scottish nationalists who want to break away from the United Kingdom and "cancel culture".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our country stands at a crossroads," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm convinced that the next few years will be some of the most dangerous, yet most transformational, our country has ever known," Sunak added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sunak's speech at the right-wing Policy Exchange think-tank is a clear pre-election pitch to voters, as Labour increasingly puts flesh on the bones of its policies before a manifesto launch.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its repeated attacks on Starmer also gave an indication of a potentially bitter and personal election battle ahead.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Sunak refused again to be drawn on when he would call the vote, repeating his well-trodden line that he was aiming for the second half of the year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He can go to the polls no later than January 2025.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Labour has enjoyed double-digit leads over the Tories in surveys since the disastrous short-lived premiership of Liz Truss that ended in October 2022, and inflicted heavy losses on the Conservatives in local elections earlier this month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The opposition -- overhauled since Starmer took over in the aftermath of Boris Johnson's election landslide for the Conservatives in 2019 -- has pledged to run the economy responsibly and hopes to match Sunak's recent pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the prime minister argued that only his party can protect Britons' safety and financial security, even after a decline in defence spending from 2010 to 2016 and the financial meltdown caused by Truss.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are storms ahead. The dangers are all too real," said Sunak, a former finance minister.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But Britain can feel proud again. Britain can feel confident again. Because with bold action and a clear plan, we can and we will create a secure future."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Asked about Sunak's speech, Starmer said security would be the "first priority" of a Labour administration.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the choice at the ballot box would be between "a changed Labour Party that puts the country first and party second" and "the chaos and division" of the Conservatives. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Indian citizens across 96 constituencies began casting their ballots on Monday as the country's gigantic, six-week-long election edges past its halfway mark.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third straight term with an eye on winning a supermajority in Parliament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Monday’s polling in the fourth round of multi-phase national elections across nine states and one union territory will be pivotal for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Crucial seats in Maharashtra and Bihar states, where the BJP governs in alliances with regional parties, were also up for grabs in this phase.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Bihar’s Samastipur city, hundreds of voters lined up at a polling station that opened at 7am amid tight security arrangements. Voters said they were concerned about rising food prices, lack of employment and economic development in the state.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Most polls predict a win for Modi and his BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million voters, more than 10 percent of the world’s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4. (AP)

    Pro-Palestinian students walk out at US graduation

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of students walked out of Duke University's commencement ceremony on Sunday to protest its guest speaker, comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who has supported Israel throughout the war in Gaza.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About 30 of the 7,000 students present left their seats, chanting “free Palestine” amid a mix of boos and cheers. Some waved the red, green, black and white Palestinian flag.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Videos posted on social media also showed several attendees leaving the viewing stands, including a person wearing a keffiyeh, which can be an emblem of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Others shouted "Jerry! Jerry!" as the actor received an honorary degree, and Seinfeld delivered his speech without major interruptions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "A lot of you are thinking, 'I can't believe they invited this guy.' Too late," he said, after vowing to "defend" the concept of privilege.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We understand the depth of feeling in our community, and as we have all year, we respect the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement," said Duke spokesperson Frank Tramble in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The walkout at Duke's graduation was the latest manifestation of protests that have roiled US campuses as students call for universities to divest from arms suppliers and other companies profiting from the war, and amnesty for students and faculty who have been disciplined or fired for protesting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At Emerson College in Boston, chants interrupted remarks by the school's president during its commencement ceremony on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some students could be seen on a recording of the event walking across the stage to receive their degrees carried signs of their support for Palestinians, including one woman who unfurled a Palestinian flag.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The protests have prompted US universities such as Columbia in New York and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to cancel their main graduation ceremonies this month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Other colleges and universities have relocated or modified commencement ceremonies. (Agencies)

 Indonesian officials on Monday said the death toll from flash floods and mudslides in Western Sumatra had risen to at least 41 people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rescue teams were still searching for another 17 people who remain missing, authorities added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Torrential rain on Saturday evening caused flash floods, landslides, and cold lava flow, which is a mixture of volcanic ash, rock debris and water that flows like mud, in three districts in West Sumatra province, according to officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The cold lava flow, known in Indonesia as a lahar, came from Mount Marapi, one of Sumatra's most active volcanoes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials said around 400 personnel, consisting of local rescuers, police, and military were deployed to search for the missing people on Monday, helped by excavators and drones.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The rescue efforts that began on Sunday were complicated by damaged roads, making it difficult for rescuers to pass through.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The national disaster and management agency (BNPB) said almost 200 houses were damaged and 72 hectares of land, including rice fields, were affected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At least 159 people had been evacuated to nearby school buildings, the BNPB said. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fighters of the Sudan Liberation Movement, a Sudanese rebel group active in Sudan's Darfur State which supports the army chief. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752900_1_20240513085956.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Clashes reignited between the Sudanese army and rival paramilitaries earlier this week in the key Darfur town of El-Fasher, the United Nations said on Sunday, killing at least 27 people in one day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Eyewitnesses have reported air strikes, artillery fire and machine gun clashes battering the city since Friday, when an hours-long battle left an estimated 850 people displaced, according to the UN.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It also killed at least 27 that day, based on what the UN said were "unconfirmed reports", as the city suffers a near-total communications blackout, with medics and human rights defenders barely able to get news to the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The fighting has since continued, eyewitnesses said Sunday, reporting air strikes and artillery shelling that left "houses on fire", one resident told AFP.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to French medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), two children and a caregiver were killed in an intensive care unit Saturday following a nearby military air strike.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since April of last year, Sudan has been in the grips of a devastating war between the army, headed by the country's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in Darfur, a region about the size of France and home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 El-Fasher is the last major city in Darfur that is not under paramilitary control. The international community, including the UN and the United States, have for weeks warned against a looming offensive on the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 MSF said Sunday that an air strike carried out by the army -- which maintains a functional monopoly on the skies -- landed 50 metres from the Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It caused the roof of the ICU to collapse, resulting in "the death of two children who remained receiving treatment there, as well as the death of at least one caregiver," according to a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The children who were killed were in a critical condition in our ICU, but their lives could have been saved," MSF's head of emergency operations Michel-Olivier Lacharite said. (AFP)

    Kremlin unveils military shakeup, new defence minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sergei Shoigu was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752884_1_20240513045138.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday moved to replace defence minister Sergei Shoigu in a major shake-up to Russia's military leadership more than two years into war with Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin proposed economist Andrey Belousov as Shoigu's replacement, according to a list of the ministerial nominations published by the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The move comes at a key time in the conflict with Russian troops advancing in eastern Ukraine and having just launched a major new ground operation against the northeastern Kharkiv region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite a string of military setbacks in the first year of the campaign -- including the failure to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and retreats from the Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions -- Putin had stood by Shoigu until now.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That included when Wagner paramilitary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched a bloody insurrection last year calling for Shoigu's removal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Explaining the timing of the decision, the Kremlin said it needed the defence ministry to stay "innovative".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The defence ministry must be absolutely open to innovation, to the introduction of all advanced ideas, to the creation of conditions for economic competitiveness," state media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying in a briefing on the appointments.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The battlefield is won by whoever is more open to innovation," Peskov said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "That is likely why the president has settled on the candidacy of Andrey Belousov," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Belousov, who has no military background, has been one of Putin's most influential economic advisers over the last decade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shoigu, 68, was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012 and has had a decades-long political career of unmatched longevity in post-Soviet Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 His presence at the centre of power in Moscow pre-dates that of Putin himself.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prior to Russia launching its full-scale military campaign on Ukraine in February 2022, he was seen as one of Putin's most trusted lieutenants.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The pair were regularly photographed on nature retreats in the Siberian wilderness, hunting and fishing together.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In one famous snap from 2017 shared by the Kremlin, they are sitting bare-chested under the sun on a beach by a lake.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Sunday, Putin simultaneously issued decrees naming Shoigu as the new secretary of the Security Council, replacing his longstanding ally Nikolai Patrushev.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Kremlin also said Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff, would stay in post overseeing daily military operations in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As for the military component, the appointment (of Belousov) will in no way change the current frame of reference," state media quoted Peskov as saying in a briefing on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff. He will continue his activities, and no changes are envisaged there at the moment," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Along with Shoigu, Gerasimov had been targeted by a hardcore group of influential pro-offensive military bloggers for Moscow's perceived military failures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prigozhin, who marched on Moscow calling for the pair's removal, died in a plane crash weeks after his aborted mutiny.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin is constitutionally required to name a new set of government ministers -- or reappoint existing ones -- following his victory in a March election devoid of opposition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmakers in Russia's rubber-stamp parliament need to approve the president's nominations, which they are set to do over the coming days.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The future of Patrushev, an arch-hawk who is sometimes seen as a possible successor to Putin, was unclear.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There was no immediate high-level reaction to the shake-up in Ukraine. (AFP)

    Thai police swoop on record drug haul

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities intercepted a tonne of crystal methamphetamine in one of the kingdom's biggest ever single seizures of the illegal drug, police said Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The haul, with an estimated value of more than US$25 million on the international market, was found when officers stopped a pickup truck in central Nakhon Nayok province on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acting National Police Chief Kittharath Punpetch said police, military and local officials had been monitoring several smuggling gangs and learned of a plan to move a large amount of the drug, commonly known by the street name "ice".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kittharath told a news conference that 40 bags of the drug, weighing a tonne in total, were found in the truck.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its driver was arrested but investigators believe the head of the smuggling network is a Thai national based in a neighbouring country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The kingdom is a major transit route for illicit drugs produced in the so-called "Golden Triangle" region where northern Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Myanmar is a major source of amphetamine, much of it produced in illegal labs in border areas controlled by ethnic minority armed groups. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In March, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital transplanted a genetically edited pig kidney into a man suffering from end-stage kidney disease. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752871_1_20240512232441.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first living patient to receive a genetically modified pig kidney transplant has died two months after the procedure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Mass General is deeply saddened at the sudden passing of Mr. Rick Slayman. We have no indication that it was the result of his recent transplant," the Boston hospital said in a statement issued late on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a world first, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in March successfully transplanted the genetically edited pig kidney into Slayman, who was 62 years old at the time and suffering from end-stage kidney disease.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation," the hospital statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Organ shortages are a chronic problem around the world and Mass General said in March that there were more than 1,400 patients on its waiting list for a kidney transplant.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The pig kidney used for the transplant was provided by a Massachusetts biotech company called eGenesis and had been modified to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes, according to the hospital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Slayman, who suffered from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, had received a transplanted human kidney in 2018, but it began to fail five years later.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When the hospital announced the successful transplant in March, Slayman said he had agreed to the procedure "not only as a way to help (him), but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a statement posted on Mass General's website, his family said while they were "deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick" they took "great comfort knowing he inspired so many."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The family said they were "comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More than 89,000 patients were on the national kidney waiting list as of March this year, according to a US health department website.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On average, 17 people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant. (AFP)

    Thousands flee Rafah as Israel begins assault

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians have been fleeing Rafah, with many heading for Khan Yunis, the main city in the south of the Palestinian territory. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752868_1_20240512222932.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 War-weary Gazans flooded towards coastal areas of the Gaza Strip's southern city of Rafah on Sunday, fleeing heavy bombardment in eastern zones after Israel ordered them to evacuate.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We endured three days that can be considered hell," said Mohammed Hamad, a 24-year-old resident of eastern Rafah who was among the 300,000 Palestinians that Israel says have fled the fighting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite international opposition to any major military operation in Rafah, Israel has shifted its focus to the heavily populated area in what it says is an effort to destroy the last bastion of Hamas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Eastern parts of the city have been heavily bombarded in recent days, according to witnesses, as Israel sent tanks and ground troops into the areas in "targeted raids".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They were among the worst nights for us since the beginning of the war," Hamad told AFP from Al-Mawasi, an area Israel has designated a "humanitarian zone" despite aid groups warning that it is unprepared for such an influx.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Rafah's population had swelled to around 1.4 million after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled fighting in other areas of the Gaza Strip and sought shelter there during more than seven months of war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They started by distributing flyers in the morning, and immediately began brutal artillery and aerial bombardment without giving people a chance to think or organise their belongings properly," Hamad said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 AFP photographers saw dozens of families loading furniture and household items on trucks and fleeing from Rafah, many heading for Khan Yunis, the main city in the south of the Palestinian territory.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Many people, especially women and children, lingered on streets outside their homes before moving out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,034 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israeli forces on Tuesday seized and closed the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing into Egypt -- through which all fuel passes into Gaza.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are no medical services or humanitarian aid being provided to the displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip," said Mahmud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's civil defence agency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "What we are witnessing in terms of killing and destruction reminds us of the early days of the aggression."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Umm Mohammed Al-Mughayyir said she has had to move her family seven times to escape the fighting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have reached a point where we wish for death," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have people with special needs, elderly individuals, and children with us. Where do we go when the bombardment never stops, day and night?"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Sunday that a full-scale Israeli assault on Rafah "cannot take place", insisting that it cannot be squared with international law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!" he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 34 people were killed and 16 more were missing in western Indonesia after flash floods and cold lava flow from one of the archipelago's most active volcanoes damaged homes, roads and mosques, local officials said on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hours of heavy rain caused flooding in two districts -- Agam and Tanah Datar -- in West Sumatra province on Saturday evening, threatening thousands after it swept ash and large rocks down Mount Marapi.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Until now our data shows that 34 people died: 16 in Agam and 18 in Tanah Datar. At least 18 others are injured. We are also still searching for 16 other people," West Sumatra disaster agency spokesman Ilham Wahab told AFP.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the search effort involved local rescuers, police, soldiers and volunteers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Abdul Malik, head of Padang Search and Rescue Agency, told reporters three more people had died but they were yet to be confirmed by other authorities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Agam and Tanah Datar were hit with flash floods and cold lava flow at around 10:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Saturday, according to the Basarnas search and rescue agency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About 370,000 people live in Tanah Datar, where several mosques and a public pool were damaged, with large rocks and logs scattered on the ground, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Lembah Anai, a popular tourist spot with a waterfall in Tanah Datar, a road connecting the cities of Padang and Bukittinggi was severely damaged and access for cars was cut off.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Aerial images of Tanah Datar showed roads covered by mud, with roofs and a mosque's minarets jutting out of the sea of brown mud.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ilham said on Sunday that authorities were still receiving reports of missing people from relatives. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The growing wave of university campus protests around the world in solidarity with Gaza "will not go away" unless the bombs and bullets stop in the besieged enclave, a political commentator in Beijing said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, said although the latest student demonstrations in Europe have been “milder” compared with the ones in the US, such movements will “only expand” as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eyes a “full-scale” assault of Rafah in Gaza – despite US warnings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There are over one million displaced Palestinians currently in the southern city of Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “You cannot expect students in these institutions to stand idly by. They watched 35,000 civilians killed, most of whom were women and children. These images are on social media and people are reacting to them”, said Tangen.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “It’s not a question of ‘do I support Hamas or do I support Israel’. Here, the issue is, people are dying. And such reactions will continue to grow as students realise that it’s not just their individual feelings, but collective feelings about this brutality.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protests that first broke out at the Columbia University in New York before spreading across some 140 campuses in the US, have now reached universities in Europe, Australia, as well as India.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fuel was added to the fire when President Joe Biden signed into law a military foreign aid package last month, which saw US$17 billion in arms going to Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Over 2,500 campus demonstrators have been arrested in the US so far.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The interesting part of it is, you now hear President Joe Biden and many other politicians talking about ‘well, free speech is fine, but you cannot have disorder’. Where was that attitude when for a year Hong Kong suffered under these protests which were disrupting business and threatening people’s lives?” Tangen said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With many of the students calling for universities to sell off shares, assets, or other investments in companies linked to Israel and its war in Gaza, a move known as divestment, Tangen believes the students should be listened to.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think it’s very appropriate for the students [to make such requests]. They are not asking for armed intervention from the US in Gaza, they are simply saying ‘don't’ support an entity’ that’s [associated with] killing civilians. Stop sending bombs, weapon systems, and bullets to Israel, and then it [the protests] will stop.”

    Switzerland wins Eurovision as Gaza war casts shadow

<div class="itemFullText">
 Switzerland's Nemo won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel's participation during the war in Gaza.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Twenty-four-year-old Nemo's "The Code" won the highest score from nations' juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden's Malmo.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world," a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nemo's journey towards realising their non-binary gender identity served as inspiration for the highly personal winning entry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "'The Code' is about the journey I started with the realisation that I am neither a man nor a woman," Nemo said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Zagreb, a crowd gathered at a square to follow Croatia's Baby Lasagna, who finished second with 547 points.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Twenty-five nations competed Saturday but much of the focus has centred on the controversy of Israel being able to take part.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When Golan went on stage to perform her "Hurricane", both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Outside the arena, police pushed back protesters where more than a hundred demonstrators waved flags and chanted "Free Palestine".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Diverse Malmo is home to the country's largest community of Palestinian origin and according to police at least 5,000 people gathered to protest in the city in the afternoon.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The European Broadcasting Union, which oversees the event, confirmed in March that Golan would take part, despite calls for her exclusion from thousands of musicians around the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The same month, contestants from nine countries, including Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire. (AFP)

    Thousands join latest protest march in Georgia

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About 50,000 opponents of a foreign agents bill marched peacefully in heavy rain through the Georgian capital on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as "agents of foreign influence", has touched off a rolling political crisis in Georgia, where thousands have taken to the streets to demand the bill be withdrawn.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The crowd on Saturday waved Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The government should hear the free people of Georgia," said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city centre, which blocked much of the city's roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi's old town.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Parliament, which is controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and its allies, will begin committee hearings on the bill's third and final reading on Monday. Opposition groups had called for a fresh wave of protests from Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The crisis has pitted the Georgian Dream ruling party against a coalition of opposition parties, civil society, celebrities and the country's figurehead president, with mass demonstrations shutting down much of central Tbilisi almost nightly for more than a month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian opponents of the bill have dubbed it "the Russian law", comparing it to legislation used to target critics of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. The European Union, which granted Georgia candidate status in December, has said that the bill will pose a serious obstacle to further integration if passed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Georgian Dream says the bill will promote transparency and Georgian national sovereignty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of Georgian Dream, has said the law is necessary to stop the West trying to use Georgians as "cannon fodder" in a confrontation with Russia. (Reuters)

    Report criticises Israel's use of US weapons in Gaza

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The war between Hamas and Israel has left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752759_1_20240511152122.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has issued a stunning criticism of Israel's use of American weapons in the Gaza war, after Israeli forces intensified operations around the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced people are sheltering.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's main international ally said in a report released on Friday that it was "reasonable to assess" that Israel has used weapons in ways inconsistent with international humanitarian law during the seven-month war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the long-awaited State Department report said it could not reach "conclusive findings" and stopped short of blocking weapons shipments.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Relations between the two allies soured earlier in the week after US President Joe Biden said he would halt some arms deliveries if Israel went ahead with a full-scale assault on Rafah threatened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The US has warned that the reputational damage Israel will suffer if it storms a city where an estimated 1.4 million civilians are sheltering will far outweigh any possible military gain.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday that Gaza risked an "epic humanitarian disaster" if Israel launched a full-scale ground operation in Rafah, while France urged Israel to cease its operations in Rafah "without delay".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Israeli premier has said repeatedly that Israel cannot defeat Hamas and eliminate any possibility of the militant group repeating its bloody October 7 attack without sending ground troops into Rafah in search of remaining Hamas fighters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Netanyahu struck a defiant tone on Thursday, vowing: "If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The White House renewed its opposition on Friday but said it saw no major operation yet against the city.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We're obviously watching it with concern, of course, but I wouldn't go so far as to say what we've seen here in the last 24 hours connotes or indicates a broad, large (or) major ground operation," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier this week, Israeli ground troops seized eastern areas of the city, including the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but they have yet to enter its main built-up area. (AFP)

    UN assembly votes to back Palestine's membership

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israel's UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan shreds a version of the UN charter on stage at the General Assembly. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752695_1_20240511015308.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations General Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly backed a Palestinian bid to become a full UN member by recognising it as qualified to join and recommending the UN Security Council "reconsider the matter favourably."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The vote by the 193-member General Assembly was a global survey of support for the Palestinian bid to become a full UN member – a move that would effectively recognize a Palestinian state – after the United States vetoed it in the UN Security Council last month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The assembly adopted a resolution with 143 votes in favor and nine against – including the US and Israel – while 25 countries abstained. It does not give the Palestinians full UN membership, but simply recognises them as qualified to join.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The resolution "determines that the State of Palestine ... should therefore be admitted to membership" and it "recommends that the Security Council reconsider the matter favorably."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Palestinian push for full UN membership comes seven months into a war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and as Israel is expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the UN considers to be illegal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We want peace, we want freedom," Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the assembly before the vote. "A yes vote is a vote for Palestinian existence, it is not against any state. ... It is an investment in peace."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Voting yes is the right thing to do," he said in remarks that drew applause.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Under the founding UN Charter, membership is open to peace-loving states that accept the obligations in that document and are able and willing to carry them out.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As long as so many of you are 'Jew-hating,' you don't really care that the Palestinians are not 'peace-loving'," UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who spoke after Mansour, told his fellow diplomats. He accused the assembly of shredding the UN Charter – as he used a small shredder to destroy a copy of the Charter while at the lectern.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An application to become a full UN member first needs to be approved by the 15-member Security Council and then the General Assembly. If the measure is again voted on by the council it is likely to face the same fate: a US veto. (Reuters)

 At least 60 people were injured on Friday when a seven-car passenger train collided with a locomotive and an empty train car in Buenos Aires, local authorities said, without giving details of how serious the injuries were.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Firefighters, police and ambulances were at the scene, helping evacuate people and take the injured to hospitals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Television and drone footage showed the trains head-to-head on a road bridge over an avenue in the Palermo neighborhood of the Argentine capital. The first car of the passenger train derailed and was damaged in the collision.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 State-run train operator Trenes Argentinos said the crash happened at 10.31am and an investigation into the cause of the accident would be opened.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "So far, as reported by the health authorities present at the scene, there are at least 60 people with injuries of varying severity," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Services on the San Martin train line were halted, it added. (Reuters)

 The former tycoon Lim Oon Kuin, known as OK Lim, was convicted on three charges, local media said, in a case involving US$111.7 million that was disbursed by the bank in March 2020 as payment for two oil sales contracts that prosecutors said were fabricated.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters opposed to expansion of US electric vehicle maker Tesla's plant in Grueneheide near Berlin clashed with police as some of them attempted to storm the facility on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some 800 people took part in the protest, according to the organising group Disrupt Tesla, which claims the expansion would damage the environment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A video showed dozens of people wearing blue caps and face-covering masks coming from a nearby wooded area and attempting to storm the company's premises with policemen trying to prevent them, including by force. At least one protester was detained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Why do the police let the left-wing protestors off so easily?" Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on his social medial platform X, adding that the demonstrators didn't manage to break through.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The video also showed medical personnel helping some injured people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are here today to draw attention to the Tesla factory in Grunheide for the environmental destruction here," Disrupt Tesla spokesperson Ole Becker told Reuters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The group also wants to highlight environmental destruction in countries like Argentina or Bolivia, brought about by lithium mining, according to Becker. Lithium is a key resource for electric vehicle batteries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We protect the freedom of assembly," Brandenburg police spokesperson Mario Heinemann said, "but we are also responsible for public order and safety. That means we will also intervene when necessary".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The police confirmed that the protesters tried to enter the plant's premises, but were prevented, with several people taken into custody, and that it received a few reports of injuries. (Reuters)

    Russian forces attack Ukraine's Kharkiv region

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian forces on Friday launched a ground assault on Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, advancing near the border town of Vovchansk, a senior Ukrainian military source said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The assault opens a new front in the conflict which began in 2022.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kyiv said it had sent more forces to the area as reinforcements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ukraine chased Russian troops out of most of the Kharkiv region in 2022, but after weathering Kyiv's counteroffensive last year, Russia forces are back on the attack and are slowly advancing in the Donetsk area further south.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fears grew in March over Moscow's intentions when Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the creation of a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory that he said was needed to protect Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since then, Kharkiv, which is particularly vulnerable because of its proximity to Russia, has been hammered by air strikes that have caused major damage to its power infrastructure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Vovchansk, a Kharkiv region border town with a pre-war population of 17,000 that has dwindled to a few thousand, officials said the settlement and surrounding areas were under massive shelling and authorities were helping civilians evacuate. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel qualified for this weekend's Eurovision song contest grand finale as thousands of demonstrators marched through Sweden's Malmo on Thursday to protest its participation over the Gaza war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Singer Eden Golan performed her song "Hurricane" in Thursday's second semi-final without incident in front of 9,000 spectators at the Malmo Arena and booked her place in Saturday's final after a televote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier in the day, more than 10,000 people including climate activist Greta Thunberg gathered in Malmo's main square before marching through the southern city's central pedestrian shopping street, according to police estimates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am a Eurovision fan and it breaks my heart, but I'm boycotting," 30-year-old protester Hilda, who did not want to provide her surname, told AFP.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I can't have fun knowing that Israel is there participating when all those kids are dying. I think it's just wrong."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alongside signs that read: "Liberate Palestine", banners that said "EUR legitimises genocide" and "colonialism cannot be washed in pink" could be seen in the crowd.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About 50 protesters made it to the front of the Malmo Arena, where the event is taking place, before being dispersed by a heavy police presence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protesters also entered the Eurovision Village, where spectators can follow the concert on large screens.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a different neighbourhood, about 100 counter-protesters gathered under police protection to express their support for Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier on Thursday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday wished Golan good luck and said she had "already won" by enduring the protests that he called a "horrible wave of anti-Semitism".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?" said protester Marwo Mustafa.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hurricane" has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition, which opened with the first semi-final on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: "At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Faculty members of The New School, a private university in New York, on Wednesday set up a pro-Palestine encampment in the lobby of the campus building near Union Square in what’s reportedly the first faculty-led protest in the United States.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The New School Free Press reported that protesting staff are calling for measures such as divestment from weapons manufacturing companies, dismissal of charges against student protesters and the removal of New York police on campus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About 20 professors occupied the lobby with tents and banners reading "Faculty Against Genocide."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The staff at The New School named their encampment after Refaat Alareer, a Palestinian poet and professor, who was killed in an airstrike in December 2023.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This comes almost a week after after police cleared an earlier encampment and arrested around 40 students who were subsequently suspended from the New School.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the United States, with more than 2,500 people arrested.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some colleges cracked down immediately, while others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in the police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Boston, police detained several people on Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after demonstrators blocked a parking garage in their ongoing protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protesters have been asking administrators to end all research contracts with Israel’s Ministry of Defense, which they estimate total US$11 million since 2015.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Thursday, the school issued an alert just before 2 pm local time, saying protesters were blocking the entrance to a campus parking garage and spilling onto a nearby street.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About two hours later, authorities split protesters up and pushed them away from the garage. At least three people were detained.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protesters walked away continuing to chant “free Palestine.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 MIT officials said later Thursday that fewer than 10 people were arrested by MIT police during the incident and the Stata Garage and Vassar Street were reopened.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hannah Didehbani, an MIT student and one of the leaders of the protest, said the decision to block the garage was part of a larger effort to bring attention to what she described as MIT’s complicity with the Israeli military.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Didehbani said she has been issued a suspension and an eviction notice by the school but said MIT cannot suspend the larger student movement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “They’d much rather do those things than cut ties to a state that is currently enacting a genocide,” she said. (Xinhua, AP)

    TikTok says will label AI-made videos automatically

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says the auto-labelling of AI-generated content will be gradual at first. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752529_1_20240510002408.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok on Thursday said it will begin labelling AI-generated content automatically from several platforms, including OpenAI's Dall-E and the company's own tools and generators.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Authentication has become a major concern in the fast development of AI, with authorities worried about the proliferation of deepfakes that could disrupt society.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "AI-generated content is an incredible creative outlet, but transparency for viewers is critical," said Adam Presser, Head of Trust & Safety at TikTok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The automatic labelling of AI-generated or edited content would be a first for social media platforms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, said it would begin testing a label "that we eventually plan to apply automatically to content that we detect was edited or created with AI."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company told the Financial Times that this will include content made using Adobe's Firefly tool, TikTok's own AI image generators and OpenAI's Dall-E.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It also said it was joining a coalition of technology and media groups, led by Adobe, that incorporate industry-wide labelling into AI-generated products, sometimes called watermarking.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The technology from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (or C2PA) sets a technical standard to better flag and identify the provenance of AI-generated content.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "By partnering with peers to label content across platforms, we're making it easy for creators to responsibly explore AI-generated content, while continuing to deter the harmful or misleading AI generated content that is prohibited on TikTok," Presser said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 TikTok said that the auto-labelling will be gradual at first, but as more platforms mark their AI-generated content according to the C2PA standard "we'll be able to label more content."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence company behind the popular image generator Dall-E and ChatGPT, on Tuesday also joined the initiative and announced the launch of a tool aimed at detecting whether digital images have been created by AI. (AFP)

    Israel says Biden threat to stop arms 'disappointing'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A top Israeli official criticised US President Joe Biden on Thursday for threatening to stop certain arms supplies to Israel if it invades the crowded Gaza city of Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is a difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war," Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said on public radio in Israel's first reaction to Biden's warning.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel has defied international objections by sending in tanks and conducting "targeted raids" in the eastern areas of Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It says Rafah is home to Hamas's last remaining battalions but the city on the border with Egypt is also crammed with displaced Palestinian civilians.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used... to deal with the cities," Biden told CNN, in his starkest warning to Israel since the start of the war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs," Biden said. "It's just wrong."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Erdan said Biden's comments would be seen by Israel's foes Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah as "something that gives them hope to succeed."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?" he said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday said the China-Hungary relationship is now at its best in history.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Tamas Sulyok at the Sandor Palace in Budapest, Xi said the friendship between the two nations had taken deep roots among the people, and cooperation in various fields had yielded fruitful outcomes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi also expressed his readiness to foster a good working relationship and friendship with Sulyok, increase exchanges and communication on matters of mutual interest, and jointly promote the high-level development of bilateral relations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hungary and China, which mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations, were also expected to sign at least 16 new cooperation agreements, one of which could be a large-scale infrastructure project linked to the Belt and Road Initiative.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi arrived in Budapest late on Wednesday after visiting France and Serbia. It is the last stop on his three-nation tour of Europe. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol announced new measures to raise the country's birthrate, which is one of the lowest globally. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752479_1_20240509172049.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on Thursday said his government's efforts to improve people's lives had fallen short, conceding his ruling party's crushing election defeat last month reflected voters' assessment of his two years in office.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In his first press conference in 21 months, Yoon pledged to focus on improving the economy and tackling what he called the national emergency of flagging birth rates over the three years he has left in office.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 South Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3 percent in the first three months of this year, but living costs have remained stubbornly high, despite some progress in tackling inflation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a new policy push, a government ministry would be set up to tackle the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque reading "The Buck Stops Here."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 South Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, maintained its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising kids as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students at Ireland's Trinity College Dublin (TCD) on Wednesday ended a five-day protest against Israel's actions in Gaza after they said their demands were met by the university.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a statement posted on its website, the university said "an agreement was reached" after "successful talks between the university's senior management and the protesters".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Laszlo Molnarfi, president of the institution's student union, said TCD's statement was a "testament to grassroots student-staff power".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 TCD said the university "will complete a divestment from investments in Israeli companies that have activities in the occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN blacklist in this regard."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protesters had demanded the university end any relationships it had with Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Security staff had closed the campus gates -- which are usually open to the public -- during the protest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Student activists began their action last Friday as a "solidarity encampment with Palestine" echoing similar protests in the United States.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Pro-Palestinian protests have rocked US campuses for weeks, spreading to countries in Europe as well as Australia. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden says Washington will halt all weapons to Israel if it launches a full-scale invasion of Rafah. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752409_1_20240509104320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden on Wednesday publicly warned Israel for the first time that the US would stop supplying it weapons if Israeli forces make a major invasion of Rafah, a refugee-packed city in southern Gaza.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah,” Biden said in an interview with CNN.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The American leader's comments represent his strongest public language to date in his effort to deter an Israeli assault on Rafah while underscoring a growing rift between the US and Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden acknowledged US weapons had been used by Israeli forces to kill civilians in Gaza, where the Jewish state has mounted a seven-month-old offensive aimed at destroying Hamas following its October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,000 people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's campaign has so far killed at least 30,000 Palestinians, many of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centres," he said when asked about 2,000-pound bombs sent to Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel's UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, earlier this week called Washington's decision to delay shipments "very disappointing" although he did not believe the US would stop supplying arms to Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel this week attacked Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians have sought refuge, but Biden said he did not consider Israel’s strikes a full-scale invasion because they have not struck “population centres.” (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from devastating floods that have ravaged southern Brazil for days reached 100 on Wednesday, authorities said, as the search continued for dozens of people still missing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nearly 400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with hundreds of people injured and 160,000 forced from their homes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Many have no access to drinking water or electricity – or even the means to call for help with telephone and internet services down in many places.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as "the emergency is continuing to develop" in the state capital of Porto Alegre and other cities and towns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were at work across the state, many in boats, and even jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Authorities urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslide and health hazards.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Many people are loathe to leave their homes for the safety of shelters amid reports of abandoned properties being looted.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Contaminated water can transmit diseases," civil defence spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The National Confederation of Municipalities said nearly 100,000 homes had been damaged or destroyed by unprecedented rains and floods in the state, with losses estimated at about 4.6 billion reais (more than US$900 million.)
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Porto Alegre is home to about 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and five dams are at risk of rupturing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip have only three days of fuel left, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday, due to closed border crossings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite international objections, Israel sent tanks into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and seized the nearby crossing into Egypt that is the main conduit for aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The closure of the border crossing continues to prevent the UN from bringing fuel. Without fuel all humanitarian operations will stop. Border closures are also impeding delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tedros said Al-Najjar, one of the three hospitals in Rafah, was no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in the vicinity and the military operation in Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "At a time when fragile humanitarian operations urgently require expansion, the Rafah military operation is further limiting our ability to reach thousands of people who have been living in dire conditions without adequate food, sanitation, health services and security," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This must stop now."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Geneva-based WHO is the UN's health agency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Israel bombarded Rafah on Wednesday as talks resumed in Cairo aimed at agreeing the terms of a truce in the seven-month war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed more than 34,800 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University in Washington DC on Wednesday and arrested demonstrators, hours after dozens marched to the home of the school’s president as city officials prepared to appear before Congress on the protest’s handling.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith were called to testify on Wednesday afternoon at the Republican-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, but the hearing was cancelled after the arrests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters of the Israel-Hamas war on campuses across the United States, and increasingly in Europe.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some colleges cracked down immediately. Others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 District of Columbia police said officers moved to disperse demonstrators because “there has been a gradual escalation in the volatility of the protest.” It said 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Some protesters were pepper sprayed as police blocked them from the camp.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 George Washington University had warned of possible suspensions for continuing the camp on University Yard. Protesters carrying signs that read, “Free Palestine” and “Hands off Rafah,” also marched to school President Ellen Granberg’s home on Tuesday night.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “While the university is committed to protecting students’ rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,” a school statement said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In France, police detained 86 people following an operation to remove students staging a pro-Palestinian occupation at the Sorbonne university in Paris, prosecutors said on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Those arrested in the police operation on Tuesday night were being held for a variety of public order offences, said the statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They include wilful damage, rebellion, violence against a person holding public authority, intrusion into an education establishment and holding a meeting designed to disrupt order. Some are also being held for participation in a group with a view to preparing violence or damage to property.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The day before police moved in, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said there would never be a right to disrupt France's universities with such protests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the Netherlands, pro-Palestinian protesters built barricades at the University of Amsterdam, using desks and railings to block off the canalside entrance in the heart of the city as they vowed to stay put until the institution severs all ties with Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Riot police used a bulldozer to knock down barricades at another University of Amsterdam site on Tuesday and detained 169 people, but said the university had not yet asked for similar intervention on Wednesday. (Agencies)

    Hottest April on record last month: EU climate monitor

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scientists have already confirmed that climate change caused some specific weather extremes in April. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752266_1_20240508104826.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's climate monitor on Wednesday said last month was the hottest April on record and the 11th consecutive month of historic global heat.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Oceans were also overheating with April marking the 13th straight monthly high for sea surface temperatures, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Each month since June 2023 has ranked as the planet's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the C3S said in a monthly bulletin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Including April, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for a 12-month period - 1.61 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some of the extremes - including months of record breaking sea surface temperatures - have led scientists to investigate whether human activity has now triggered a tipping point in the climate system.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system," said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Still, the EU's climate monitor also said the natural El Nino phenomenon which warms the Pacific Ocean and contributes to hotter weather globally "continued to weaken" in April towards more "neutral conditions". (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Protests by students demanding universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war spread across western Europe on Tuesday, sparking clashes and dozens of fresh arrests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's punishing assault on Gaza.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Several hundred protesters resumed a demonstration around the University of Amsterdam campus, where police the previous night were filmed baton-charging them and smashing up their tents after they refused to leave the grounds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As protests resumed on Tuesday night, demonstrators erected barriers to access routes watched over by a heavy police deployment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police said in a statement that a total of 169 people had been arrested when officers broke up Monday night's protests.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 All had been released apart from two still in custody on suspicion of public disorder offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Violence had briefly erupted Monday when a small group of counter-protesters wielding flares stormed the main protest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Around 50 demonstrators were also protesting Tuesday outside the library in Utrecht University and a few dozen at the Technical University of Delft, according to local news agency ANP.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the eastern German city of Leipzig, the university said in a statement that 50 to 60 people occupied a lecture hall on Tuesday, waving banners that read: "University occupation against genocide".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Protesters barricaded the lecture hall doors from the inside and erected tents in the courtyard, according to the university.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The institution called in the police in the afternoon, and filed a criminal complaint.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Criminal proceedings have been initiated against 13 people who were in the lecture hall on suspicion of trespassing. No arrests have been made so far.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier, at Berlin's Free University, police cleared a demonstration after up to 80 people erected a protest camp in a courtyard of the campus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The protesters, some of whom wore the keffiyeh scarf that has long been a symbol of the Palestinian cause, sat in front of tents and waved banners.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They later tried to enter rooms and lecture halls and occupy them, according to the university, which said it then called in police to clear the protest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The university said property was damaged while classes in some buildings were suspended for the day. Berlin police said they made some arrests for incitement to hatred and trespassing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Paris, police twice intervened at the prestigious Sciences Po university to disperse about 20 students who had barricaded themselves in the main hall.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Security forces moved in to allow other students to take their exams and made two arrests, according to Paris prosecutors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The university said exams proceeded without incident.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the nearby Sorbonne university building, police late Tuesday moved to eject about 100 students who had occupied an amphitheatre and made 88 arrests, police sources said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Switzerland, protests spread to three universities in Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The University of Lausanne said in a statement it "considers that there is no reason to cease these relations" with Israeli universities as protesters demand.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Austria, dozens of protesters have been camped on the campus of Vienna University, pitching tents and stringing up banners since late Thursday. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752255_1_20240508095326.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in riot gear cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday after administrators who had initially adopted a permissive approach said the protest had crossed a line and caused growing concerns about safety.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 University president Paul Alivisatos issued a message after officers blocked access to the school's Quad.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The university remains a place where dissenting voices have many avenues to express themselves, but we cannot enable an environment where the expression of some dominates and disrupts the healthy functioning of the community for the rest,” he wrote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hundreds of protesters had gathered for at least eight days at the university until campus administrators warned them on Friday to leave the area or face removal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Tuesday, law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers later picked up a barricade erected to keep protesters out of the Quad and moved it toward the demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation!”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the US — and increasingly, in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some colleges have cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since April 18, just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities, according to figures based on reporting by the Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As pro-Palestinian protests continue to spread, the White House said President Joe Biden welcomes peaceful protests at college commencement ceremonies where he and other administration officials will speak.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest," she added. "What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Biden last week addressed the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest "but not a right to cause chaos" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafael Grossi held talks with Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation head Mohammad Eslami. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752216_1_20240508030843.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi on Tuesday decried "completely unsatisfactory" cooperation from Tehran after returning from Iran where he urged leaders to adopt "concrete" measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Grossi's visit came at a time of heightened regional tensions and with his International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) criticising Iran for lack of cooperation on inspections and other outstanding issues.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The present state is completely unsatisfactory for me. We are almost at an impasse and this needs to be changed," Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna, where the IAEA is based.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said there was no "magic wand" to solve a "very, very complex set of issues," while he pressed the Islamic republic to "deliver very soon."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But of course, for me and also I would say for the international community, there is a need to have some results sooner rather than later," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier on Tuesday, at a news conference in the Iranian city of Isfahan, Grossi said he had proposed to Iranian officials that they "focus on the very concrete, very practical and tangible measures that can be implemented in order to accelerate" cooperation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Grossi held talks with senior Iranian officials including Atomic Energy Organisation's head Mohammad Eslami and spoke at Iran's first International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology held in Isfahan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Grossi insisted on the need to "settle differences" on the nuclear issue while the Middle East was going through "difficult times", particularly the war between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Sometimes, political conditions pose obstacles to full-fledged cooperation" between Iran and the international community, Grossi told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Grossi said a March 2023 agreement with Iran was "still valid" but required more "substance."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agreement was reached during Grossi's last visit to Iran and outlined basic cooperation measures including on safeguards and monitoring.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The IAEA chief said, however, that there had been a "slowdown" in the agreement's implementation, including Iran reducing the number of inspections and withdrawing the accreditation of a group of IAEA experts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Iran suspended compliance with a landmark 2015 deal setting caps on nuclear activities after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752210_1_20240508011635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tiny Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09 am (0609 GMT).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating," the inspector added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road's edge in front of the mansion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The 37-year-old Drake, known for hits such as "God's Plan" and "Hotline Bling," was the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He is currently embroiled in a feud with Kendrick Lamar, with the rappers exchanging barbed "diss tracks" that have drawn widespread attention.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beefs are nothing new in hip-hop, a genre long known both for its artists' boasts and their strongly worded takedowns of rivals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There was no indication that the shooting had any relation to the rap battle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Asked about the bad blood between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Krawczyk said he was aware of it, but added, "it is so early in the investigation that we don't have a motive at this time, and so I cannot comment further on that." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the heart of Donald Trump's hush money case, took the witness stand on Tuesday at the blockbuster trial of the former US president.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The people call Stormy Daniels," prosecutor Susan Hoffinger announced as the 77-year-old Trump sat at the defence table in the Manhattan courtroom flanked by his lawyers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daniels' testimony is expected to be a pivotal moment in the courtroom drama rocking the scandal-plagued Republican's attempt to recapture the White House.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Daniels, 45, a long-time actor and director in the adult film industry, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was then paid to keep quiet about it on the eve of his 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, when the news could have sunk his campaign.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels and Susan Necheles, a lawyer for the former president, lodged an objection with the judge presiding over the trial to allowing her to testify about any "sexual acts."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is unduly prejudicial," Necheles told Judge Juan Merchan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Hoffinger said Daniels' testimony would not be graphic and would "omit details that are too salacious."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Prosecutors say that Trump – desperate to kill Daniels' story before it could wreck his chances in the narrow 2016 race – illegally reimbursed his fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover up the US$130,000 hush money payment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cohen, who has become a vocal critic of his former boss, is also expected to testify at the trial as a prosecution witness. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German police on Tuesday broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at Berlin’s Free University earlier in the day, the latest such action by authorities as protests that have roiled campuses in the United States spread across Europe.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The protesters had put up about 20 tents and formed a human chain around them. Most had covered their faces with medical masks and had draped kufiyah scarves around their heads, shouting slogans such as “Viva, viva Palestina”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police had called on the students via loudspeakers to leave the campus, and officers could also be seen carrying some students away, and using pepper spray against some of the protesters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The school's administrators said in a statement that the protesters had rejected any kind of dialogue and they had therefore called in police to clear the campus.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “This form of protest is not geared towards dialogue. An occupation is not acceptable on the Free University Berlin campus,” university president Guenter Ziegler said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The administrators said some protesters attempted to enter rooms and lecture halls at Free University in order to occupy them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain, following earlier protests at US campuses. (AP)

    Vladimir Putin inaugurated as Russian president

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Vladimir Putin began his fifth term on Tuesday as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Already in office for nearly a quarter-century, and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Putin’s new term doesn’t expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At 71, Putin dominates the domestic political landscape.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the international stage, he is locked in a confrontation with Western countries he accuses of using Ukraine as a vehicle to try to defeat and dismember Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin in March won a landslide victory in a tightly controlled election from which two anti-war candidates were barred on technical grounds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 His best known opponent, Alexei Navalny, died suddenly in an Arctic penal colony a month earlier, and other leading critics are in jail or have been forced to flee abroad.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin first became Russian leader in late 1999, when he succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dutch riot police ended a pro-Palestinian demonstration at an Amsterdam university early on Tuesday, arresting some 125 people in sometimes violent clashes, authorities said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In messages posted overnight on social media X, police said they had to act to stop the event and dismantle tents that been set up by protesters, who used violence against police at the site at the University of Amsterdam.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The police's input was necessary to restore order. We see the footage on social media. We understand that those images may appear as intense," police said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Local media showed demonstrators shooting fireworks at police officers but there were no immediate reports of injuries on either side.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "All is now quiet... police stay in the vicinity of the Roeterseiland campus," police said later on X.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Outgoing Education minister Robbert Dijkgraaf said universities are a place for dialogue and debate and he was sad to see that police had to intervene.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Student protests over the war and academic ties with Israel have begun to spread across Europe, but have remained much smaller in scale than those seen in the United States. (Reuters)

    Israel says it is 'in control' of key Gaza crossing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israel army says in 'operational control' of Gaza side of Rafah crossing. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752143_1_20240507144135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said it took "operational control" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Tuesday and that troops were scanning the area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Right now we have special forces scanning the crossing... We have operational control of the area and other crossings and we have special forces scanning the area," the military said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are only talking about the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Israeli 401st Brigade entered the Rafah crossing early Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said, taking “operational control” of the crucial crossing for both aid and those able to flee into Egypt.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Footage released by the Israeli military showed a tank entering the crossing. Details of the video matched known features of the crossing and showed Israeli flags flying from tanks that seized the area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Israeli military claimed it seized the crossing after receiving intelligence it was “being used for terrorist purposes.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The military did not provide evidence to immediately support the assertion, though it alleged the area around the crossing had been used to launch a mortar attack that killed four Israeli troops and wounded others near the Kerem Shalom Crossing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The military also said that ground troops and airstrikes targeted suspected Hamas positions in Rafah.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Egypt previously warned any seizure of Rafah could see Palestinians fleeing over the border, a scenario that could threaten a 1979 peace deal with Israel that’s been a linchpin for regional security.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The offensive again raised the risks of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Egyptian officials said the proposal called for a cease-fire of multiple stages starting with a limited hostage release and partial Israeli troop pullbacks within Gaza.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two sides would also negotiate a “permanent calm” that would lead to a full hostage release and greater Israeli withdrawal out of the territory, they said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Hamas militant group, which controls Gaza, has sought clearer guarantees for its key demand of an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal in return for the release of all hostages. (Agencies)
