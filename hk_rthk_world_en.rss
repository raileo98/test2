<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court later on Monday charged under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chi Leung-wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu-yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Indian citizens across 96 constituencies began casting their ballots on Monday as the country's gigantic, six-week-long election edges past its halfway mark.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third straight term with an eye on winning a supermajority in Parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday’s polling in the fourth round of multi-phase national elections across nine states and one union territory will be pivotal for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crucial seats in Maharashtra and Bihar states, where the BJP governs in alliances with regional parties, were also up for grabs in this phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Bihar’s Samastipur city, hundreds of voters lined up at a polling station that opened at 7am amid tight security arrangements. Voters said they were concerned about rising food prices, lack of employment and economic development in the state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls predict a win for Modi and his BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The staggered election will run until June 1 and nearly 970 million voters, more than 10 percent of the world’s population, will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The votes are scheduled to be counted on June 4. (AP)

    Pro-Palestinian students walk out at US graduation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of students walked out of Duke University's commencement ceremony on Sunday to protest its guest speaker, comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who has supported Israel throughout the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About 30 of the 7,000 students present left their seats, chanting “free Palestine” amid a mix of boos and cheers. Some waved the red, green, black and white Palestinian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos posted on social media also showed several attendees leaving the viewing stands, including a person wearing a keffiyeh, which can be an emblem of solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others shouted "Jerry! Jerry!" as the actor received an honorary degree, and Seinfeld delivered his speech without major interruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A lot of you are thinking, 'I can't believe they invited this guy.' Too late," he said, after vowing to "defend" the concept of privilege.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I say, use your privilege. I grew up a Jewish boy from New York. That is a privilege if you want to be a comedian," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand the depth of feeling in our community, and as we have all year, we respect the right of everyone at Duke to express their views peacefully, without preventing graduates and their families from celebrating their achievement," said Duke spokesperson Frank Tramble in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The walkout at Duke's graduation was the latest manifestation of protests that have roiled US campuses as students call for universities to divest from arms suppliers and other companies profiting from the war, and amnesty for students and faculty who have been disciplined or fired for protesting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Emerson College in Boston, chants interrupted remarks by the school's president during its commencement ceremony on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some students could be seen on a recording of the event walking across the stage to receive their degrees carried signs of their support for Palestinians, including one woman who unfurled a Palestinian flag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protests have prompted US universities such as Columbia in New York and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to cancel their main graduation ceremonies this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other colleges and universities have relocated or modified commencement ceremonies. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian officials on Monday said the death toll from flash floods and mudslides in Western Sumatra had risen to at least 41 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rescue teams were still searching for another 17 people who remain missing, authorities added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain on Saturday evening caused flash floods, landslides, and cold lava flow, which is a mixture of volcanic ash, rock debris and water that flows like mud, in three districts in West Sumatra province, according to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cold lava flow, known in Indonesia as a lahar, came from Mount Marapi, one of Sumatra's most active volcanoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said around 400 personnel, consisting of local rescuers, police, and military were deployed to search for the missing people on Monday, helped by excavators and drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rescue efforts that began on Sunday were complicated by damaged roads, making it difficult for rescuers to pass through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national disaster and management agency (BNPB) said almost 200 houses were damaged and 72 hectares of land, including rice fields, were affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 159 people had been evacuated to nearby school buildings, the BNPB said. (Reuters)

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752900_1_20240513085956.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Clashes reignited between the Sudanese army and rival paramilitaries earlier this week in the key Darfur town of El-Fasher, the United Nations said on Sunday, killing at least 27 people in one day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses have reported air strikes, artillery fire and machine gun clashes battering the city since Friday, when an hours-long battle left an estimated 850 people displaced, according to the UN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also killed at least 27 that day, based on what the UN said were "unconfirmed reports", as the city suffers a near-total communications blackout, with medics and human rights defenders barely able to get news to the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighting has since continued, eyewitnesses said Sunday, reporting air strikes and artillery shelling that left "houses on fire", one resident told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to French medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), two children and a caregiver were killed in an intensive care unit Saturday following a nearby military air strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since April of last year, Sudan has been in the grips of a devastating war between the army, headed by the country's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF has seized four out of five state capitals in Darfur, a region about the size of France and home to around one quarter of Sudan's 48 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  El-Fasher is the last major city in Darfur that is not under paramilitary control. The international community, including the UN and the United States, have for weeks warned against a looming offensive on the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MSF said Sunday that an air strike carried out by the army -- which maintains a functional monopoly on the skies -- landed 50 metres from the Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It caused the roof of the ICU to collapse, resulting in "the death of two children who remained receiving treatment there, as well as the death of at least one caregiver," according to a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The children who were killed were in a critical condition in our ICU, but their lives could have been saved," MSF's head of emergency operations Michel-Olivier Lacharite said. (AFP)

    Kremlin unveils military shakeup, new defence minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sergei Shoigu was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752884_1_20240513045138.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday moved to replace defence minister Sergei Shoigu in a major shake-up to Russia's military leadership more than two years into war with Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin proposed economist Andrey Belousov as Shoigu's replacement, according to a list of the ministerial nominations published by the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes at a key time in the conflict with Russian troops advancing in eastern Ukraine and having just launched a major new ground operation against the northeastern Kharkiv region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite a string of military setbacks in the first year of the campaign -- including the failure to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and retreats from the Kharkiv and southern Kherson regions -- Putin had stood by Shoigu until now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That included when Wagner paramilitary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched a bloody insurrection last year calling for Shoigu's removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining the timing of the decision, the Kremlin said it needed the defence ministry to stay "innovative".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The defence ministry must be absolutely open to innovation, to the introduction of all advanced ideas, to the creation of conditions for economic competitiveness," state media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying in a briefing on the appointments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The battlefield is won by whoever is more open to innovation," Peskov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is likely why the president has settled on the candidacy of Andrey Belousov," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belousov, who has no military background, has been one of Putin's most influential economic advisers over the last decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shoigu, 68, was appointed Russian defence minister in 2012 and has had a decades-long political career of unmatched longevity in post-Soviet Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His presence at the centre of power in Moscow pre-dates that of Putin himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to Russia launching its full-scale military campaign on Ukraine in February 2022, he was seen as one of Putin's most trusted lieutenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were regularly photographed on nature retreats in the Siberian wilderness, hunting and fishing together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one famous snap from 2017 shared by the Kremlin, they are sitting bare-chested under the sun on a beach by a lake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Putin simultaneously issued decrees naming Shoigu as the new secretary of the Security Council, replacing his longstanding ally Nikolai Patrushev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin also said Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff, would stay in post overseeing daily military operations in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As for the military component, the appointment (of Belousov) will in no way change the current frame of reference," state media quoted Peskov as saying in a briefing on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff. He will continue his activities, and no changes are envisaged there at the moment," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Along with Shoigu, Gerasimov had been targeted by a hardcore group of influential pro-offensive military bloggers for Moscow's perceived military failures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prigozhin, who marched on Moscow calling for the pair's removal, died in a plane crash weeks after his aborted mutiny.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is constitutionally required to name a new set of government ministers -- or reappoint existing ones -- following his victory in a March election devoid of opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers in Russia's rubber-stamp parliament need to approve the president's nominations, which they are set to do over the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The future of Patrushev, an arch-hawk who is sometimes seen as a possible successor to Putin, was unclear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate high-level reaction to the shake-up in Ukraine. (AFP)

    Thai police swoop on record drug haul

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities intercepted a tonne of crystal methamphetamine in one of the kingdom's biggest ever single seizures of the illegal drug, police said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The haul, with an estimated value of more than US$25 million on the international market, was found when officers stopped a pickup truck in central Nakhon Nayok province on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting National Police Chief Kittharath Punpetch said police, military and local officials had been monitoring several smuggling gangs and learned of a plan to move a large amount of the drug, commonly known by the street name "ice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kittharath told a news conference that 40 bags of the drug, weighing a tonne in total, were found in the truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its driver was arrested but investigators believe the head of the smuggling network is a Thai national based in a neighbouring country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The kingdom is a major transit route for illicit drugs produced in the so-called "Golden Triangle" region where northern Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar is a major source of amphetamine, much of it produced in illegal labs in border areas controlled by ethnic minority armed groups. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In March, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital transplanted a genetically edited pig kidney into a man suffering from end-stage kidney disease.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first living patient to receive a genetically modified pig kidney transplant has died two months after the procedure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Mass General is deeply saddened at the sudden passing of Mr. Rick Slayman. We have no indication that it was the result of his recent transplant," the Boston hospital said in a statement issued late on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a world first, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital in March successfully transplanted the genetically edited pig kidney into Slayman, who was 62 years old at the time and suffering from end-stage kidney disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Slayman will forever be seen as a beacon of hope to countless transplant patients worldwide and we are deeply grateful for his trust and willingness to advance the field of xenotransplantation," the hospital statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organ shortages are a chronic problem around the world and Mass General said in March that there were more than 1,400 patients on its waiting list for a kidney transplant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pig kidney used for the transplant was provided by a Massachusetts biotech company called eGenesis and had been modified to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes, according to the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slayman, who suffered from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, had received a transplanted human kidney in 2018, but it began to fail five years later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the hospital announced the successful transplant in March, Slayman said he had agreed to the procedure "not only as a way to help (him), but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted on Mass General's website, his family said while they were "deeply saddened about the sudden passing of our beloved Rick" they took "great comfort knowing he inspired so many."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family said they were "comforted by the optimism he provided patients desperately waiting for a transplant".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 89,000 patients were on the national kidney waiting list as of March this year, according to a US health department website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On average, 17 people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 War-weary Gazans flooded towards coastal areas of the Gaza Strip's southern city of Rafah on Sunday, fleeing heavy bombardment in eastern zones after Israel ordered them to evacuate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We endured three days that can be considered hell," said Mohammed Hamad, a 24-year-old resident of eastern Rafah who was among the 300,000 Palestinians that Israel says have fled the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite international opposition to any major military operation in Rafah, Israel has shifted its focus to the heavily populated area in what it says is an effort to destroy the last bastion of Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eastern parts of the city have been heavily bombarded in recent days, according to witnesses, as Israel sent tanks and ground troops into the areas in "targeted raids".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were among the worst nights for us since the beginning of the war," Hamad told AFP from Al-Mawasi, an area Israel has designated a "humanitarian zone" despite aid groups warning that it is unprepared for such an influx.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rafah's population had swelled to around 1.4 million after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled fighting in other areas of the Gaza Strip and sought shelter there during more than seven months of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They started by distributing flyers in the morning, and immediately began brutal artillery and aerial bombardment without giving people a chance to think or organise their belongings properly," Hamad said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AFP photographers saw dozens of families loading furniture and household items on trucks and fleeing from Rafah, many heading for Khan Yunis, the main city in the south of the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people, especially women and children, lingered on streets outside their homes before moving out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,034 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli forces on Tuesday seized and closed the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing into Egypt -- through which all fuel passes into Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are no medical services or humanitarian aid being provided to the displaced people in the northern Gaza Strip," said Mahmud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's civil defence agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we are witnessing in terms of killing and destruction reminds us of the early days of the aggression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Umm Mohammed Al-Mughayyir said she has had to move her family seven times to escape the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reached a point where we wish for death," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have people with special needs, elderly individuals, and children with us. Where do we go when the bombardment never stops, day and night?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Sunday that a full-scale Israeli assault on Rafah "cannot take place", insisting that it cannot be squared with international law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The latest evacuation orders affect close to a million people in Rafah. So where should they go now? There is no safe place in Gaza!" he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 34 people were killed and 16 more were missing in western Indonesia after flash floods and cold lava flow from one of the archipelago's most active volcanoes damaged homes, roads and mosques, local officials said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hours of heavy rain caused flooding in two districts -- Agam and Tanah Datar -- in West Sumatra province on Saturday evening, threatening thousands after it swept ash and large rocks down Mount Marapi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Until now our data shows that 34 people died: 16 in Agam and 18 in Tanah Datar. At least 18 others are injured. We are also still searching for 16 other people," West Sumatra disaster agency spokesman Ilham Wahab told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the search effort involved local rescuers, police, soldiers and volunteers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abdul Malik, head of Padang Search and Rescue Agency, told reporters three more people had died but they were yet to be confirmed by other authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Agam and Tanah Datar were hit with flash floods and cold lava flow at around 10:30 pm (1530 GMT) on Saturday, according to the Basarnas search and rescue agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcano's slopes by rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 370,000 people live in Tanah Datar, where several mosques and a public pool were damaged, with large rocks and logs scattered on the ground, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lembah Anai, a popular tourist spot with a waterfall in Tanah Datar, a road connecting the cities of Padang and Bukittinggi was severely damaged and access for cars was cut off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aerial images of Tanah Datar showed roads covered by mud, with roofs and a mosque's minarets jutting out of the sea of brown mud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ilham said on Sunday that authorities were still receiving reports of missing people from relatives. (AFP)

    Protests won't stop until bombs stop in Gaza: analyst

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A protest encampment at George Washington University, in Washington DC. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752847_1_20240512160020.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The growing wave of university campus protests around the world in solidarity with Gaza "will not go away" unless the bombs and bullets stop in the besieged enclave, a political commentator in Beijing said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, said although the latest student demonstrations in Europe have been “milder” compared with the ones in the US, such movements will “only expand” as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu eyes a “full-scale” assault of Rafah in Gaza – despite US warnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are over one million displaced Palestinians currently in the southern city of Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You cannot expect students in these institutions to stand idly by. They watched 35,000 civilians killed, most of whom were women and children. These images are on social media and people are reacting to them”, said Tangen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not a question of ‘do I support Hamas or do I support Israel’. Here, the issue is, people are dying. And such reactions will continue to grow as students realise that it’s not just their individual feelings, but collective feelings about this brutality.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests that first broke out at the Columbia University in New York before spreading across some 140 campuses in the US, have now reached universities in Europe, Australia, as well as India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel was added to the fire when President Joe Biden signed into law a military foreign aid package last month, which saw US$17 billion in arms going to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 2,500 campus demonstrators have been arrested in the US so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The interesting part of it is, you now hear President Joe Biden and many other politicians talking about ‘well, free speech is fine, but you cannot have disorder’. Where was that attitude when for a year Hong Kong suffered under these protests which were disrupting business and threatening people’s lives?” Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With many of the students calling for universities to sell off shares, assets, or other investments in companies linked to Israel and its war in Gaza, a move known as divestment, Tangen believes the students should be listened to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s very appropriate for the students [to make such requests]. They are not asking for armed intervention from the US in Gaza, they are simply saying ‘don't’ support an entity’ that’s [associated with] killing civilians. Stop sending bombs, weapon systems, and bullets to Israel, and then it [the protests] will stop.”

    Switzerland wins Eurovision as Gaza war casts shadow

<div class="itemFullText">
 Switzerland's Nemo won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday, becoming the first artist identifying as non-binary to claim victory, in a competition marked by controversy over Israel's participation during the war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty-four-year-old Nemo's "The Code" won the highest score from nations' juries, and enough of the popular votes to get 591 points, edging out Croatia in the final, held in Sweden's Malmo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world," a teary-eyed Nemo said while receiving the trophy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nemo's journey towards realising their non-binary gender identity served as inspiration for the highly personal winning entry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "'The Code' is about the journey I started with the realisation that I am neither a man nor a woman," Nemo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Zagreb, a crowd gathered at a square to follow Croatia's Baby Lasagna, who finished second with 547 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-five nations competed Saturday but much of the focus has centred on the controversy of Israel being able to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Golan went on stage to perform her "Hurricane", both cheers and boos could be heard from the audience in the Malmo Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside the arena, police pushed back protesters where more than a hundred demonstrators waved flags and chanted "Free Palestine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diverse Malmo is home to the country's largest community of Palestinian origin and according to police at least 5,000 people gathered to protest in the city in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Broadcasting Union, which oversees the event, confirmed in March that Golan would take part, despite calls for her exclusion from thousands of musicians around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same month, contestants from nine countries, including Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire. (AFP)

    Thousands join latest protest march in Georgia

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About 50,000 opponents of a foreign agents bill marched peacefully in heavy rain through the Georgian capital on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as "agents of foreign influence", has touched off a rolling political crisis in Georgia, where thousands have taken to the streets to demand the bill be withdrawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd on Saturday waved Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should hear the free people of Georgia," said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city centre, which blocked much of the city's roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi's old town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, which is controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and its allies, will begin committee hearings on the bill's third and final reading on Monday. Opposition groups had called for a fresh wave of protests from Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crisis has pitted the Georgian Dream ruling party against a coalition of opposition parties, civil society, celebrities and the country's figurehead president, with mass demonstrations shutting down much of central Tbilisi almost nightly for more than a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian opponents of the bill have dubbed it "the Russian law", comparing it to legislation used to target critics of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin. The European Union, which granted Georgia candidate status in December, has said that the bill will pose a serious obstacle to further integration if passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian Dream says the bill will promote transparency and Georgian national sovereignty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of Georgian Dream, has said the law is necessary to stop the West trying to use Georgians as "cannon fodder" in a confrontation with Russia. (Reuters)

    Report criticises Israel's use of US weapons in Gaza

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The war between Hamas and Israel has left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752759_1_20240511152122.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has issued a stunning criticism of Israel's use of American weapons in the Gaza war, after Israeli forces intensified operations around the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced people are sheltering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's main international ally said in a report released on Friday that it was "reasonable to assess" that Israel has used weapons in ways inconsistent with international humanitarian law during the seven-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the long-awaited State Department report said it could not reach "conclusive findings" and stopped short of blocking weapons shipments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two allies soured earlier in the week after US President Joe Biden said he would halt some arms deliveries if Israel went ahead with a full-scale assault on Rafah threatened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US has warned that the reputational damage Israel will suffer if it storms a city where an estimated 1.4 million civilians are sheltering will far outweigh any possible military gain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday that Gaza risked an "epic humanitarian disaster" if Israel launched a full-scale ground operation in Rafah, while France urged Israel to cease its operations in Rafah "without delay".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli premier has said repeatedly that Israel cannot defeat Hamas and eliminate any possibility of the militant group repeating its bloody October 7 attack without sending ground troops into Rafah in search of remaining Hamas fighters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu struck a defiant tone on Thursday, vowing: "If we have to stand alone, we will stand alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House renewed its opposition on Friday but said it saw no major operation yet against the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're obviously watching it with concern, of course, but I wouldn't go so far as to say what we've seen here in the last 24 hours connotes or indicates a broad, large (or) major ground operation," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Israeli ground troops seized eastern areas of the city, including the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, but they have yet to enter its main built-up area. (AFP)

    UN assembly votes to back Palestine's membership

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations General Assembly on Friday overwhelmingly backed a Palestinian bid to become a full UN member by recognising it as qualified to join and recommending the UN Security Council "reconsider the matter favourably."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The vote by the 193-member General Assembly was a global survey of support for the Palestinian bid to become a full UN member – a move that would effectively recognize a Palestinian state – after the United States vetoed it in the UN Security Council last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assembly adopted a resolution with 143 votes in favor and nine against – including the US and Israel – while 25 countries abstained. It does not give the Palestinians full UN membership, but simply recognises them as qualified to join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The resolution "determines that the State of Palestine ... should therefore be admitted to membership" and it "recommends that the Security Council reconsider the matter favorably."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian push for full UN membership comes seven months into a war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and as Israel is expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank, which the UN considers to be illegal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want peace, we want freedom," Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the assembly before the vote. "A yes vote is a vote for Palestinian existence, it is not against any state. ... It is an investment in peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Voting yes is the right thing to do," he said in remarks that drew applause.

  <br/>
  Under the founding UN Charter, membership is open to peace-loving states that accept the obligations in that document and are able and willing to carry them out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As long as so many of you are 'Jew-hating,' you don't really care that the Palestinians are not 'peace-loving'," UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who spoke after Mansour, told his fellow diplomats. He accused the assembly of shredding the UN Charter – as he used a small shredder to destroy a copy of the Charter while at the lectern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An application to become a full UN member first needs to be approved by the 15-member Security Council and then the General Assembly. If the measure is again voted on by the council it is likely to face the same fate: a US veto. (Reuters)

 At least 60 people were injured on Friday when a seven-car passenger train collided with a locomotive and an empty train car in Buenos Aires, local authorities said, without giving details of how serious the injuries were.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Firefighters, police and ambulances were at the scene, helping evacuate people and take the injured to hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television and drone footage showed the trains head-to-head on a road bridge over an avenue in the Palermo neighborhood of the Argentine capital. The first car of the passenger train derailed and was damaged in the collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State-run train operator Trenes Argentinos said the crash happened at 10.31am and an investigation into the cause of the accident would be opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, as reported by the health authorities present at the scene, there are at least 60 people with injuries of varying severity," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services on the San Martin train line were halted, it added. (Reuters)

 The founder of collapsed oil trading firm Hin Leong Trading was convicted by a Singapore court on Friday of cheating global bank HSBC and abetting forgery, local media reported.

  <br/>
  The former tycoon Lim Oon Kuin, known as OK Lim, was convicted on three charges, local media said, in a case involving US$111.7 million that was disbursed by the bank in March 2020 as payment for two oil sales contracts that prosecutors said were fabricated.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters opposed to expansion of US electric vehicle maker Tesla's plant in Grueneheide near Berlin clashed with police as some of them attempted to storm the facility on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some 800 people took part in the protest, according to the organising group Disrupt Tesla, which claims the expansion would damage the environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video showed dozens of people wearing blue caps and face-covering masks coming from a nearby wooded area and attempting to storm the company's premises with policemen trying to prevent them, including by force. At least one protester was detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why do the police let the left-wing protestors off so easily?" Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on his social medial platform X, adding that the demonstrators didn't manage to break through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also showed medical personnel helping some injured people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are here today to draw attention to the Tesla factory in Grunheide for the environmental destruction here," Disrupt Tesla spokesperson Ole Becker told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also wants to highlight environmental destruction in countries like Argentina or Bolivia, brought about by lithium mining, according to Becker. Lithium is a key resource for electric vehicle batteries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We protect the freedom of assembly," Brandenburg police spokesperson Mario Heinemann said, "but we are also responsible for public order and safety. That means we will also intervene when necessary".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police confirmed that the protesters tried to enter the plant's premises, but were prevented, with several people taken into custody, and that it received a few reports of injuries. (Reuters)

    Russian forces attack Ukraine's Kharkiv region

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian forces on Friday launched a ground assault on Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, advancing near the border town of Vovchansk, a senior Ukrainian military source said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The assault opens a new front in the conflict which began in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv said it had sent more forces to the area as reinforcements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine chased Russian troops out of most of the Kharkiv region in 2022, but after weathering Kyiv's counteroffensive last year, Russia forces are back on the attack and are slowly advancing in the Donetsk area further south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fears grew in March over Moscow's intentions when Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the creation of a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory that he said was needed to protect Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Kharkiv, which is particularly vulnerable because of its proximity to Russia, has been hammered by air strikes that have caused major damage to its power infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Vovchansk, a Kharkiv region border town with a pre-war population of 17,000 that has dwindled to a few thousand, officials said the settlement and surrounding areas were under massive shelling and authorities were helping civilians evacuate. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel qualified for this weekend's Eurovision song contest grand finale as thousands of demonstrators marched through Sweden's Malmo on Thursday to protest its participation over the Gaza war.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Singer Eden Golan performed her song "Hurricane" in Thursday's second semi-final without incident in front of 9,000 spectators at the Malmo Arena and booked her place in Saturday's final after a televote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the day, more than 10,000 people including climate activist Greta Thunberg gathered in Malmo's main square before marching through the southern city's central pedestrian shopping street, according to police estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am a Eurovision fan and it breaks my heart, but I'm boycotting," 30-year-old protester Hilda, who did not want to provide her surname, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't have fun knowing that Israel is there participating when all those kids are dying. I think it's just wrong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alongside signs that read: "Liberate Palestine", banners that said "EUR legitimises genocide" and "colonialism cannot be washed in pink" could be seen in the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 50 protesters made it to the front of the Malmo Arena, where the event is taking place, before being dispersed by a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters also entered the Eurovision Village, where spectators can follow the concert on large screens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a different neighbourhood, about 100 counter-protesters gathered under police protection to express their support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Thursday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday wished Golan good luck and said she had "already won" by enduring the protests that he called a "horrible wave of anti-Semitism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?" said protester Marwo Mustafa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hurricane" has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition, which opened with the first semi-final on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: "At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it." (AFP)

    First faculty-led Gaza protest encampment set up in NY

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Faculty members of The New School, a private university in New York, on Wednesday set up a pro-Palestine encampment in the lobby of the campus building near Union Square in what’s reportedly the first faculty-led protest in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New School Free Press reported that protesting staff are calling for measures such as divestment from weapons manufacturing companies, dismissal of charges against student protesters and the removal of New York police on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 20 professors occupied the lobby with tents and banners reading "Faculty Against Genocide."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The staff at The New School named their encampment after Refaat Alareer, a Palestinian poet and professor, who was killed in an airstrike in December 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes almost a week after after police cleared an earlier encampment and arrested around 40 students who were subsequently suspended from the New School.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the United States, with more than 2,500 people arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges cracked down immediately, while others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in the police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Boston, police detained several people on Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after demonstrators blocked a parking garage in their ongoing protest movement connected to the Israel-Hamas war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters have been asking administrators to end all research contracts with Israel’s Ministry of Defense, which they estimate total US$11 million since 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the school issued an alert just before 2 pm local time, saying protesters were blocking the entrance to a campus parking garage and spilling onto a nearby street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About two hours later, authorities split protesters up and pushed them away from the garage. At least three people were detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters walked away continuing to chant “free Palestine.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MIT officials said later Thursday that fewer than 10 people were arrested by MIT police during the incident and the Stata Garage and Vassar Street were reopened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Didehbani, an MIT student and one of the leaders of the protest, said the decision to block the garage was part of a larger effort to bring attention to what she described as MIT’s complicity with the Israeli military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Didehbani said she has been issued a suspension and an eviction notice by the school but said MIT cannot suspend the larger student movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They’d much rather do those things than cut ties to a state that is currently enacting a genocide,” she said. (Xinhua, AP)

    TikTok says will label AI-made videos automatically

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says the auto-labelling of AI-generated content will be gradual at first. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752529_1_20240510002408.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok on Thursday said it will begin labelling AI-generated content automatically from several platforms, including OpenAI's Dall-E and the company's own tools and generators.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authentication has become a major concern in the fast development of AI, with authorities worried about the proliferation of deepfakes that could disrupt society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "AI-generated content is an incredible creative outlet, but transparency for viewers is critical," said Adam Presser, Head of Trust & Safety at TikTok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automatic labelling of AI-generated or edited content would be a first for social media platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, said it would begin testing a label "that we eventually plan to apply automatically to content that we detect was edited or created with AI."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company told the Financial Times that this will include content made using Adobe's Firefly tool, TikTok's own AI image generators and OpenAI's Dall-E.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it was joining a coalition of technology and media groups, led by Adobe, that incorporate industry-wide labelling into AI-generated products, sometimes called watermarking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (or C2PA) sets a technical standard to better flag and identify the provenance of AI-generated content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By partnering with peers to label content across platforms, we're making it easy for creators to responsibly explore AI-generated content, while continuing to deter the harmful or misleading AI generated content that is prohibited on TikTok," Presser said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok said that the auto-labelling will be gradual at first, but as more platforms mark their AI-generated content according to the C2PA standard "we'll be able to label more content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence company behind the popular image generator Dall-E and ChatGPT, on Tuesday also joined the initiative and announced the launch of a tool aimed at detecting whether digital images have been created by AI. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A top Israeli official criticised US President Joe Biden on Thursday for threatening to stop certain arms supplies to Israel if it invades the crowded Gaza city of Rafah.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is a difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war," Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, said on public radio in Israel's first reaction to Biden's warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has defied international objections by sending in tanks and conducting "targeted raids" in the eastern areas of Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It says Rafah is home to Hamas's last remaining battalions but the city on the border with Egypt is also crammed with displaced Palestinian civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used... to deal with the cities," Biden told CNN, in his starkest warning to Israel since the start of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs," Biden said. "It's just wrong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erdan said Biden's comments would be seen by Israel's foes Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah as "something that gives them hope to succeed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?" he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday said the China-Hungary relationship is now at its best in history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Tamas Sulyok at the Sandor Palace in Budapest, Xi said the friendship between the two nations had taken deep roots among the people, and cooperation in various fields had yielded fruitful outcomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also expressed his readiness to foster a good working relationship and friendship with Sulyok, increase exchanges and communication on matters of mutual interest, and jointly promote the high-level development of bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary and China, which mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations, were also expected to sign at least 16 new cooperation agreements, one of which could be a large-scale infrastructure project linked to the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Budapest late on Wednesday after visiting France and Serbia. It is the last stop on his three-nation tour of Europe. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol announced new measures to raise the country's birthrate, which is one of the lowest globally.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on Thursday said his government's efforts to improve people's lives had fallen short, conceding his ruling party's crushing election defeat last month reflected voters' assessment of his two years in office.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his first press conference in 21 months, Yoon pledged to focus on improving the economy and tackling what he called the national emergency of flagging birth rates over the three years he has left in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3 percent in the first three months of this year, but living costs have remained stubbornly high, despite some progress in tackling inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a new policy push, a government ministry would be set up to tackle the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque reading "The Buck Stops Here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, maintained its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising kids as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Students at Ireland's Trinity College Dublin (TCD) on Wednesday ended a five-day protest against Israel's actions in Gaza after they said their demands were met by the university.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted on its website, the university said "an agreement was reached" after "successful talks between the university's senior management and the protesters".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Laszlo Molnarfi, president of the institution's student union, said TCD's statement was a "testament to grassroots student-staff power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCD said the university "will complete a divestment from investments in Israeli companies that have activities in the occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN blacklist in this regard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters had demanded the university end any relationships it had with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security staff had closed the campus gates -- which are usually open to the public -- during the protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student activists began their action last Friday as a "solidarity encampment with Palestine" echoing similar protests in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pro-Palestinian protests have rocked US campuses for weeks, spreading to countries in Europe as well as Australia. (AFP)

    Biden warns Israel US will stop weapons supply

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden says Washington will halt all weapons to Israel if it launches a full-scale invasion of Rafah. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752409_1_20240509104320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden on Wednesday publicly warned Israel for the first time that the US would stop supplying it weapons if Israeli forces make a major invasion of Rafah, a refugee-packed city in southern Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah,” Biden said in an interview with CNN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American leader's comments represent his strongest public language to date in his effort to deter an Israeli assault on Rafah while underscoring a growing rift between the US and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden acknowledged US weapons had been used by Israeli forces to kill civilians in Gaza, where the Jewish state has mounted a seven-month-old offensive aimed at destroying Hamas following its October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's campaign has so far killed at least 30,000 Palestinians, many of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centres," he said when asked about 2,000-pound bombs sent to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, earlier this week called Washington's decision to delay shipments "very disappointing" although he did not believe the US would stop supplying arms to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel this week attacked Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians have sought refuge, but Biden said he did not consider Israel’s strikes a full-scale invasion because they have not struck “population centres.” (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from devastating floods that have ravaged southern Brazil for days reached 100 on Wednesday, authorities said, as the search continued for dozens of people still missing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with hundreds of people injured and 160,000 forced from their homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have no access to drinking water or electricity – or even the means to call for help with telephone and internet services down in many places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as "the emergency is continuing to develop" in the state capital of Porto Alegre and other cities and towns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were at work across the state, many in boats, and even jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslide and health hazards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people are loathe to leave their homes for the safety of shelters amid reports of abandoned properties being looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Contaminated water can transmit diseases," civil defence spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Confederation of Municipalities said nearly 100,000 homes had been damaged or destroyed by unprecedented rains and floods in the state, with losses estimated at about 4.6 billion reais (more than US$900 million.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Porto Alegre is home to about 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and five dams are at risk of rupturing. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752368_1_20240509003721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip have only three days of fuel left, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday, due to closed border crossings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite international objections, Israel sent tanks into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and seized the nearby crossing into Egypt that is the main conduit for aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The closure of the border crossing continues to prevent the UN from bringing fuel. Without fuel all humanitarian operations will stop. Border closures are also impeding delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tedros said Al-Najjar, one of the three hospitals in Rafah, was no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in the vicinity and the military operation in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At a time when fragile humanitarian operations urgently require expansion, the Rafah military operation is further limiting our ability to reach thousands of people who have been living in dire conditions without adequate food, sanitation, health services and security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This must stop now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Geneva-based WHO is the UN's health agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel bombarded Rafah on Wednesday as talks resumed in Cairo aimed at agreeing the terms of a truce in the seven-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed more than 34,800 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University in Washington DC on Wednesday and arrested demonstrators, hours after dozens marched to the home of the school’s president as city officials prepared to appear before Congress on the protest’s handling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith were called to testify on Wednesday afternoon at the Republican-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, but the hearing was cancelled after the arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters of the Israel-Hamas war on campuses across the United States, and increasingly in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges cracked down immediately. Others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District of Columbia police said officers moved to disperse demonstrators because “there has been a gradual escalation in the volatility of the protest.” It said 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Some protesters were pepper sprayed as police blocked them from the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George Washington University had warned of possible suspensions for continuing the camp on University Yard. Protesters carrying signs that read, “Free Palestine” and “Hands off Rafah,” also marched to school President Ellen Granberg’s home on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While the university is committed to protecting students’ rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,” a school statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In France, police detained 86 people following an operation to remove students staging a pro-Palestinian occupation at the Sorbonne university in Paris, prosecutors said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested in the police operation on Tuesday night were being held for a variety of public order offences, said the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include wilful damage, rebellion, violence against a person holding public authority, intrusion into an education establishment and holding a meeting designed to disrupt order. Some are also being held for participation in a group with a view to preparing violence or damage to property.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before police moved in, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said there would never be a right to disrupt France's universities with such protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, pro-Palestinian protesters built barricades at the University of Amsterdam, using desks and railings to block off the canalside entrance in the heart of the city as they vowed to stay put until the institution severs all ties with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riot police used a bulldozer to knock down barricades at another University of Amsterdam site on Tuesday and detained 169 people, but said the university had not yet asked for similar intervention on Wednesday. (Agencies)

    Hottest April on record last month: EU climate monitor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's climate monitor on Wednesday said last month was the hottest April on record and the 11th consecutive month of historic global heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oceans were also overheating with April marking the 13th straight monthly high for sea surface temperatures, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each month since June 2023 has ranked as the planet's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the C3S said in a monthly bulletin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including April, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for a 12-month period - 1.61 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the extremes - including months of record breaking sea surface temperatures - have led scientists to investigate whether human activity has now triggered a tipping point in the climate system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system," said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the EU's climate monitor also said the natural El Nino phenomenon which warms the Pacific Ocean and contributes to hotter weather globally "continued to weaken" in April towards more "neutral conditions". (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Protests by students demanding universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war spread across western Europe on Tuesday, sparking clashes and dozens of fresh arrests.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's punishing assault on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several hundred protesters resumed a demonstration around the University of Amsterdam campus, where police the previous night were filmed baton-charging them and smashing up their tents after they refused to leave the grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests resumed on Tuesday night, demonstrators erected barriers to access routes watched over by a heavy police deployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said in a statement that a total of 169 people had been arrested when officers broke up Monday night's protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All had been released apart from two still in custody on suspicion of public disorder offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence had briefly erupted Monday when a small group of counter-protesters wielding flares stormed the main protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 demonstrators were also protesting Tuesday outside the library in Utrecht University and a few dozen at the Technical University of Delft, according to local news agency ANP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the eastern German city of Leipzig, the university said in a statement that 50 to 60 people occupied a lecture hall on Tuesday, waving banners that read: "University occupation against genocide".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters barricaded the lecture hall doors from the inside and erected tents in the courtyard, according to the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institution called in the police in the afternoon, and filed a criminal complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Criminal proceedings have been initiated against 13 people who were in the lecture hall on suspicion of trespassing. No arrests have been made so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, at Berlin's Free University, police cleared a demonstration after up to 80 people erected a protest camp in a courtyard of the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protesters, some of whom wore the keffiyeh scarf that has long been a symbol of the Palestinian cause, sat in front of tents and waved banners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They later tried to enter rooms and lecture halls and occupy them, according to the university, which said it then called in police to clear the protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said property was damaged while classes in some buildings were suspended for the day. Berlin police said they made some arrests for incitement to hatred and trespassing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Paris, police twice intervened at the prestigious Sciences Po university to disperse about 20 students who had barricaded themselves in the main hall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security forces moved in to allow other students to take their exams and made two arrests, according to Paris prosecutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said exams proceeded without incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the nearby Sorbonne university building, police late Tuesday moved to eject about 100 students who had occupied an amphitheatre and made 88 arrests, police sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Switzerland, protests spread to three universities in Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Lausanne said in a statement it "considers that there is no reason to cease these relations" with Israeli universities as protesters demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Austria, dozens of protesters have been camped on the campus of Vienna University, pitching tents and stringing up banners since late Thursday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in riot gear cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday after administrators who had initially adopted a permissive approach said the protest had crossed a line and caused growing concerns about safety.
 <br>
  <br/>
  University president Paul Alivisatos issued a message after officers blocked access to the school's Quad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The university remains a place where dissenting voices have many avenues to express themselves, but we cannot enable an environment where the expression of some dominates and disrupts the healthy functioning of the community for the rest,” he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of protesters had gathered for at least eight days at the university until campus administrators warned them on Friday to leave the area or face removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers later picked up a barricade erected to keep protesters out of the Quad and moved it toward the demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the US — and increasingly, in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges have cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since April 18, just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities, according to figures based on reporting by the Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As pro-Palestinian protests continue to spread, the White House said President Joe Biden welcomes peaceful protests at college commencement ceremonies where he and other administration officials will speak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest," she added. "What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden last week addressed the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest "but not a right to cause chaos" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses. (Agencies)

    UN atomic chief bemoans lack of cooperation from Iran

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafael Grossi held talks with Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation head Mohammad Eslami. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752216_1_20240508030843.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi on Tuesday decried "completely unsatisfactory" cooperation from Tehran after returning from Iran where he urged leaders to adopt "concrete" measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Grossi's visit came at a time of heightened regional tensions and with his International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) criticising Iran for lack of cooperation on inspections and other outstanding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The present state is completely unsatisfactory for me. We are almost at an impasse and this needs to be changed," Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna, where the IAEA is based.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there was no "magic wand" to solve a "very, very complex set of issues," while he pressed the Islamic republic to "deliver very soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But of course, for me and also I would say for the international community, there is a need to have some results sooner rather than later," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Tuesday, at a news conference in the Iranian city of Isfahan, Grossi said he had proposed to Iranian officials that they "focus on the very concrete, very practical and tangible measures that can be implemented in order to accelerate" cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi held talks with senior Iranian officials including Atomic Energy Organisation's head Mohammad Eslami and spoke at Iran's first International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology held in Isfahan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi insisted on the need to "settle differences" on the nuclear issue while the Middle East was going through "difficult times", particularly the war between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes, political conditions pose obstacles to full-fledged cooperation" between Iran and the international community, Grossi told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi said a March 2023 agreement with Iran was "still valid" but required more "substance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement was reached during Grossi's last visit to Iran and outlined basic cooperation measures including on safeguards and monitoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IAEA chief said, however, that there had been a "slowdown" in the agreement's implementation, including Iran reducing the number of inspections and withdrawing the accreditation of a group of IAEA experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran suspended compliance with a landmark 2015 deal setting caps on nuclear activities after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions. (AFP)

    Canadian police probe shooting near Drake's home

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752210_1_20240508011635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tiny Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09 am (0609 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating," the inspector added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road's edge in front of the mansion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Drake, known for hits such as "God's Plan" and "Hotline Bling," was the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is currently embroiled in a feud with Kendrick Lamar, with the rappers exchanging barbed "diss tracks" that have drawn widespread attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beefs are nothing new in hip-hop, a genre long known both for its artists' boasts and their strongly worded takedowns of rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no indication that the shooting had any relation to the rap battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the bad blood between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Krawczyk said he was aware of it, but added, "it is so early in the investigation that we don't have a motive at this time, and so I cannot comment further on that." (AFP)

    Stormy Daniels takes witness stand at Trump trial

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the heart of Donald Trump's hush money case, took the witness stand on Tuesday at the blockbuster trial of the former US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The people call Stormy Daniels," prosecutor Susan Hoffinger announced as the 77-year-old Trump sat at the defence table in the Manhattan courtroom flanked by his lawyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels' testimony is expected to be a pivotal moment in the courtroom drama rocking the scandal-plagued Republican's attempt to recapture the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, 45, a long-time actor and director in the adult film industry, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was then paid to keep quiet about it on the eve of his 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, when the news could have sunk his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels and Susan Necheles, a lawyer for the former president, lodged an objection with the judge presiding over the trial to allowing her to testify about any "sexual acts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unduly prejudicial," Necheles told Judge Juan Merchan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hoffinger said Daniels' testimony would not be graphic and would "omit details that are too salacious."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors say that Trump – desperate to kill Daniels' story before it could wreck his chances in the narrow 2016 race – illegally reimbursed his fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover up the US$130,000 hush money payment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen, who has become a vocal critic of his former boss, is also expected to testify at the trial as a prosecution witness. (AFP)

    Macron hosts Xi Jinping in French mountains

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German police on Tuesday broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at Berlin’s Free University earlier in the day, the latest such action by authorities as protests that have roiled campuses in the United States spread across Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The protesters had put up about 20 tents and formed a human chain around them. Most had covered their faces with medical masks and had draped kufiyah scarves around their heads, shouting slogans such as “Viva, viva Palestina”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had called on the students via loudspeakers to leave the campus, and officers could also be seen carrying some students away, and using pepper spray against some of the protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's administrators said in a statement that the protesters had rejected any kind of dialogue and they had therefore called in police to clear the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This form of protest is not geared towards dialogue. An occupation is not acceptable on the Free University Berlin campus,” university president Guenter Ziegler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administrators said some protesters attempted to enter rooms and lecture halls at Free University in order to occupy them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain, following earlier protests at US campuses. (AP)

    Vladimir Putin inaugurated as Russian president

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vladimir Putin began his fifth term on Tuesday as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Already in office for nearly a quarter-century, and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Putin’s new term doesn’t expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 71, Putin dominates the domestic political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the international stage, he is locked in a confrontation with Western countries he accuses of using Ukraine as a vehicle to try to defeat and dismember Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin in March won a landslide victory in a tightly controlled election from which two anti-war candidates were barred on technical grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His best known opponent, Alexei Navalny, died suddenly in an Arctic penal colony a month earlier, and other leading critics are in jail or have been forced to flee abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin first became Russian leader in late 1999, when he succeeded Boris Yeltsin as president. (Agencies)

 Dutch riot police ended a pro-Palestinian demonstration at an Amsterdam university early on Tuesday, arresting some 125 people in sometimes violent clashes, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In messages posted overnight on social media X, police said they had to act to stop the event and dismantle tents that been set up by protesters, who used violence against police at the site at the University of Amsterdam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police's input was necessary to restore order. We see the footage on social media. We understand that those images may appear as intense," police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media showed demonstrators shooting fireworks at police officers but there were no immediate reports of injuries on either side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All is now quiet... police stay in the vicinity of the Roeterseiland campus," police said later on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outgoing Education minister Robbert Dijkgraaf said universities are a place for dialogue and debate and he was sad to see that police had to intervene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student protests over the war and academic ties with Israel have begun to spread across Europe, but have remained much smaller in scale than those seen in the United States. (Reuters)

    Israel says it is 'in control' of key Gaza crossing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israel army says in 'operational control' of Gaza side of Rafah crossing. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752143_1_20240507144135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said it took "operational control" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Tuesday and that troops were scanning the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Right now we have special forces scanning the crossing... We have operational control of the area and other crossings and we have special forces scanning the area," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are only talking about the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli 401st Brigade entered the Rafah crossing early Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said, taking “operational control” of the crucial crossing for both aid and those able to flee into Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage released by the Israeli military showed a tank entering the crossing. Details of the video matched known features of the crossing and showed Israeli flags flying from tanks that seized the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military claimed it seized the crossing after receiving intelligence it was “being used for terrorist purposes.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military did not provide evidence to immediately support the assertion, though it alleged the area around the crossing had been used to launch a mortar attack that killed four Israeli troops and wounded others near the Kerem Shalom Crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military also said that ground troops and airstrikes targeted suspected Hamas positions in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt previously warned any seizure of Rafah could see Palestinians fleeing over the border, a scenario that could threaten a 1979 peace deal with Israel that’s been a linchpin for regional security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The offensive again raised the risks of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egyptian officials said the proposal called for a cease-fire of multiple stages starting with a limited hostage release and partial Israeli troop pullbacks within Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides would also negotiate a “permanent calm” that would lead to a full hostage release and greater Israeli withdrawal out of the territory, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas militant group, which controls Gaza, has sought clearer guarantees for its key demand of an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal in return for the release of all hostages. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian woman, accused of killing her in-laws with a toxic mushroom-laced beef Wellington, pleaded not guilty to a raft of murder charges on Tuesday, court officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erin Patterson faces three counts of murder for allegedly dishing up a poisonous meal in July 2023 that killed her parents-in-law, as well as the wife of a local pastor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 49-year-old, who is also accused of attempting to kill her estranged husband four times, indicated to a Melbourne court that she would fight the charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Court officials said the case, which has captured headlines around the world, would now be fast-tracked for trial at the Supreme Court of Victoria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patterson allegedly served the beef Wellington to her estranged parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, as well as local Baptist pastor Ian Wilkinson, 69, and his wife Heather Wilkinson, 66.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have previously suggested the meal she served included lethal death cap mushrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three of the lunch guests -- Don and Gail Patterson, and Heather Wilkinson -- died in the days following the meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ian Wilkinson recovered after spending nearly two months in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Detectives said husband Simon Patterson also "became ill after meals" served by his estranged wife on four separate occasions in 2021 and 2022 -- and have charged Erin Patterson with his attempted murder. (AFP)

    Boeing Starliner spaceship launch postponed
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1752092-20240507.htm

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The postponement was announced about two hours before blast-off. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752092_1_20240507090426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically postponed around two hours before launch after a new safety issue was identified, officials said Monday, in a fresh blow to the US aerospace giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already strapped in their seats preparing for lift-off when the call for a "scrub" came, in order to give engineers time to investigate anomalous readings from an oxygen relief valve on the second stage of the rocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Standing down on tonight's attempt to launch," tweeted NASA chief Bill Nelson. "As I've said before, @NASA's first priority is safety. We go when we're ready."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission comes at a challenging time for Boeing, as a safety crisis engulfs its commercial aviation division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The test flight, which has already experienced years of delays, is a crucial step for the space agency, which has long sought a second commercial partner to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX achieved the feat with its Dragon capsule in 2020, ending a nearly decade-long dependence on Russian rockets following the end of the Space Shuttle program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clad in Boeing's bright blue spacesuits, the astronauts were helped out of the spaceship then boarded a van to leave the launch tower at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, returning to their quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next possible launch window is on Tuesday, then Friday and Saturday, assuming the issue is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will be propelled into orbit by an Atlas V rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture. Once in space, the crew will take the helm, piloting the craft manually to test its capabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts, both Navy-trained pilots and space program veterans, have each been to the ISS twice, traveling once on a shuttle and then aboard a Russian Soyuz vessel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule with a cabin about as roomy as an SUV, is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS for a week-long stay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams and Wilmore will conduct a series of tests to verify the capsule's functionality before returning to Earth for a parachute-assisted landing in the western United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by numerous setbacks in the Starliner programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, software defects meant the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS. "Ground intervention prevented loss of vehicle," said NASA in the aftermath, chiding Boeing for inadequate safety checks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022 in a non-crewed launch. But other problems that came to light -- including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin that needed to be removed -- caused further delays to the crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA use on regular ISS missions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club four years ago, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of US$4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules under its Commercial Crew Program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marked a shift in NASA's approach from owning space flight hardware to instead paying private partners for their services as the primary customer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took a swipe at Boeing, gloating that his company "finished 4 years sooner" despite receiving a smaller contract. He attributed Boeing's delay to "too many non-technical managers" in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to taxi humans to the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the orbital lab is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used for future private space stations that several companies are developing. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia announced on Monday that its troops stationed near Ukraine would run nuclear weapons drills and threatened to strike UK military targets outside the embattled country, citing what it said was an escalation in Western sabre-rattling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry announced the drills and also said Russian forces had captured two villages in eastern Ukraine, where outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian troops have been struggling to hold their positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in the border region of Belgorod meanwhile said that Ukrainian aerial attacks had left at least seven people dead and wounded over 30, including several children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin, who ordered the nuclear drills, has upped his nuclear rhetoric since ordering his army into Ukraine in 2022, warning in February there was a "real" risk of nuclear war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry gave no date for the exercises, but said they would involve the air force, navy and troops stationed near Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said they were aimed at ensuring Russian territorial integrity in the face of Western "threats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin specified that the exercises were a response to statements by French President Emmanuel Macron and British officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has in recent days hit out at Macron for telling The Economist magazine he was "not ruling anything out" in the West's response to the conflict in Ukraine, including sending troops to the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also blasted UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron for saying Kyiv has the right to strike targets inside Russia. (AFP)

    Biden speaks with Netanyahu as Rafah invasion looms

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden held urgent talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday after Israel defied repeated US warnings and told Palestinians to evacuate part of the southern Gaza city of Rafah ahead of an offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call came as Biden mounts a diplomatic offensive to get ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas back on track, with Jordan's King Abdullah II due at the White House for lunch on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden told Netanyahu in April that invading Rafah would be a "mistake," and Washington has said it does not support an offensive without a credible plan to protect some 1.2 million civilians sheltering there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House confirmed that "President Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Netanyahu," and said it would release a readout with details of the call soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden did not respond to shouted questions and walked straight to the Oval Office from his helicopter, Marine One, after arriving back at the White House from a weekend at his family home in Wilmington, Delaware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the US National Security Council, announcing earlier that the call would take place, said "we have made our views clear on a major ground invasion of Rafah to the Israeli government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to believe that a hostage deal is the best way to preserve the lives of the hostages, and avoid an invasion of Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Those talks are ongoing now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is under growing domestic pressure about the war in Gaza in an election year, with pro-Palestinian protests roiling US university campuses in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York's prestigious Columbia University, which has been at the heart of the protests, said on Monday it had canceled the main graduation ceremony for students next week. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scottish political veteran John Swinney on Monday was named head of the pro-independence SNP party, leaving him poised to become Scotland's new leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swinney, 60, said on X, formerly Twitter, he was "deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP" after Humza Yousaf resigned last week after little more than a year as Scottish leader and head of the Scottish National Party (SNP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNP confirmed Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters later that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence his key policy idea was the eradication of child poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a curse and under my leadership I want to eradicate it in Scotland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On independence he said the party would "get our act together" to win back the votes of supporters who may have turned away from the party in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Humza stepped down last Monday as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swinney, an old party hand who led the SNP from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, will now face a vote in the Scottish parliament later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal trial on Monday said he would hold the former president in contempt of court for a 10th time for violating a gag order, and warned he would consider jailing him for any further violations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Justice Juan Merchan said the nine fines he had imposed so far did not seem to be deterring Trump from violating the gag order, which prohibits him from making public comments about jurors, witnesses and families of the judge and prosecutors if the statements mean to interfere with the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan said he considered jail time “truly the last resort” for many reasons, including the disruption to the trial, the political implications of jailing a leading presidential candidate ahead of an election and the extraordinary security challenges of incarcerating an ex-president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said Trump’s “continued, willful” violations of the gag order amounted to a “direct attack on the rule of law.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I do not want to impose a jail sanction and have done everything I can to avoid doing so. But I will if necessary,” Merchan said from the bench in the absence of the jury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York law allows fines of up to US$1,000 or jail time of up to 30 days for violating a court-imposed gag order. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday attended a China-France-EU trilateral meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said China regarded Europe as an important partner in helping it achieve its modernisation goals and said the two sides should stay committed to their partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president added China regarded Europe as a priority of its foreign policy, and sees China-EU relations from a strategic and long-term perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi's French counterpart, Macron, said the international situation made EU-China dialogue more essential than ever, adding it was important to ensure a level playing field between the two sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trade, Sino-European relations, the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East dominated talks between the three leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron said coordination with Beijing on "major crises" including Ukraine was "absolutely decisive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said China had been working "vigorously" to facilitate talks for peace in Ukraine while adding that Beijing was ready to work with the EU to support a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On trade, Macron urged "fair rules for all" while the EU's von der Leyen said relations between Brussels and Beijing were challenged over issues linked to market access.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said whether viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand, there was no such thing as "China's overcapacity problem". (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Israel tells Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said Monday it was evacuating about 100,000 people from eastern Rafah, ahead of an expected ground assault in the southern city of Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The estimate is around 100,000 people," a military spokesman told journalists when asked how many people were being evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 1.2 million people are currently sheltering in Rafah, according to the World Health Organisation, most having fled there from elsewhere in Gaza during the seven-month war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evacuation "is part of our plans to dismantle Hamas... we had a violent reminder of their presence and their operational abilities in Rafah yesterday," the military spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is an evacuation plan to get people out of harm's way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, three Israeli soldiers were killed and a dozen wounded, the army said, when a barrage of rockets was fired towards the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army said the rockets were fired from an area adjacent to Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldiers were hit while guarding heavy machinery, tanks and bulldozers stationed in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain fell on Monday as the army airdropped leaflets advising about the evacuation, an AFP correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's armed wing claimed the rocket attack, which led Israeli authorities to close the crossing, used to deliver aid into Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eurovision 2024 began in the Swedish city of Malmo on Sunday when 37 contenders walked the "Turquoise Carpet" amid heightened security and calls for boycotts due to Israel's participation.
 <br>
  <br>
   The 68th version of the song contest, which is always billed as non-political, is taking place against the backdrop of the devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Much focus is expected to be on Israeli contestant Eden Golan, when she performs her song "Hurricane" in the second semi-final on Thursday, with bookmakers placing the entry among the top 10 to win the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli delegation did not attend the carpet on Sunday due to Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, said Swedish broadcaster SVT, which co-organises the contest with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel agreed to modify the lyrics of its original song "October Rain", which the EBU said made reference to the October 7 Hamas onslaught.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The contest comprises three live shows, with half a dozen countries having a shot at the title this year, according to fans and bookmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sweden's Loreen won the 2023 competition in Liverpool, northern England, with her song "Tattoo", granting the Nordic country an automatic entry into next Saturday's grand final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The "Big Five" of the EBU - the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy - are also automatically given a spot in the final, while the other contenders will compete in semi-finals for the remaining places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will be the seventh time Sweden is hosting the song contest after last doing so in 2016, and the third time Malmo will stage the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sweden's participants for this year, twins Marcus & Martinus, were drawn in March to open the final with their dance pop song "Unforgettable". (Reuters)

    Gaza ceasefire hopes fade amid impasse

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians look at the rubble left after an Israeli strike on a house in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=20&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751914_1_20240506005518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prospects for a Gaza ceasefire appeared slim on Sunday as Hamas reiterated its demand for an end to the war in exchange for the freeing of hostages, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flatly ruled that out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two sides blamed each other for the impasse and the Hamas delegation said it would leave Cairo truce talks on Sunday night to consult with its leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In their second day of talks with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, Hamas negotiators maintained their stance that any truce agreement must end the war, Palestinian officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli officials have not travelled to Cairo to take part in indirect diplomacy, but on Sunday Netanyahu reiterated Israel's aim since the start of the war nearly seven months ago: to disarm and dismantle the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas for good or else endanger Israel's future security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister said Israel was willing to pause fighting in Gaza in order to secure the release of hostages still being held by Hamas, believed to number more than 130.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But while Israel has shown willingness, Hamas remains entrenched in its extreme positions, first among them the demand to remove all our forces from the Gaza Strip, end the war, and leave Hamas in power," Netanyahu said. "Israel cannot accept that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indicating that this round of talks may soon unwind, a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters on Sunday: "If Netanyahu doesn't change his mind, there will be no reason to stay. They can always reconvene if that changes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The latest round of mediation in Cairo is near to collapse," one official briefed on the talks told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas did not seem to be serious about reaching a truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are observing worrying signs that Hamas does not intend to reach an agreement with us," Gallant said. "This means strong military action in Rafah will begin in the very near future, and in the rest of the Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released shortly after Netanyahu's, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group was still keen on reaching a comprehensive ceasefire that ends the Israeli "aggression", guarantees Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, and achieves "a serious" deal to free Israelis being held hostage in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh blamed Netanyahu for "the continuation of the aggression and the expansion of the circle of conflict, and sabotaging the efforts made through the mediators and various parties".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began after Hamas stunned Israel with a cross-border raid on October 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 252 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed, 29 of them in the past 24 hours, and more than 77,000 have been wounded in Israel's assault, according to Gaza's health ministry. The bombardment has devastated much of the coastal enclave and caused a humanitarian crisis. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raging floods and mudslides this past week have killed at least 55 people in southern Brazil and forced nearly 70,000 to flee their homes, the country's civil defence agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said least 74 people were injured and another 67 were missing from the catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-rising water levels in the state of Rio Grande do Sul were straining dams and threatening the economically important city of Porto Alegre, home to some 1.4 million residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guaiba River, which flows through the city, was at a historic high of 5.04 metres, well above the 4.76 metres that had stood as a record since the devastating floods of 1941.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities scrambled to evacuate swamped neighbourhoods as rescue workers used four-wheel-drive vehicles -- and even jet skis -- to move through waist-deep water in search of the stranded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence officials also said more than a million people lacked access to potable water amid the flooding, describing damage as incalculable. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian police said on Sunday they had shot dead a boy after he stabbed a man in Western Australia's capital Perth, in an attack authorities said indicated terrorism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were signs the 16-year-old, armed with a kitchen knife, had been radicalised online, state authorities said, adding they received calls from concerned members of the local Muslim community before the attack, which occurred late on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack, in the suburb of Willetton, had "hallmarks" of terrorism but was yet to be declared a terrorist act, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone," Western Australia Premier Roger Cook told a televised press conference in the state capital Perth, regarding the attacker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victim, stabbed in the back, was stable in hospital, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the incident by police and intelligence agencies, which advised there was no ongoing threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia," Albanese said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offences in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney, on April 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the bishop came only days after a stabbing spree killed six in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to the federal government. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour leader Keir Starmer has hailed a swing to Labour, just five years after the party was trounced by the Conservatives. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751833_1_20240505020621.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's ruling Conservatives on Saturday braced for further losses in local elections, their worst results in recent memory and a key test before a general election to be held by January.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's party lost nearly 500 councillors and control of 12 councils as well as a parliamentary seat, after voting on Thursday across a swathe of England saw the Labour opposition make huge gains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The beleaguered Tory leader faces more likely defeats when results of crunch mayoral races -- in London, Liverpool and Manchester -- are announced later, but is hoping to retain the West Midlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare success on Friday, a Tory mayor won a third term in Tees Valley, northeast England -- albeit with a vastly reduced majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour, out of power since 2010 and trounced by Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election in 2019, seized on its claim to the Blackpool South seat in parliament and other successes to demand a national vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's turn the page on decline," Labour leader Keir Starmer told supporters on Saturday in the East Midlands, where the party won the mayoral race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak must order a general election be held by January 28 next year at the latest, and has said he is planning on a poll in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, Sunak conceded the returns showed "voters are frustrated" but insisted "Labour is not winning in places they admit they need for a majority".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We Conservatives have everything to fight for," Sunak concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour has enjoyed double-digit poll leads for all of Sunak's 18 months in charge, as previous scandals, a cost-of-living crisis and various other issues dent the Tories' standing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, they were defending nearly 1,000 council seats, many secured in 2021 when they led nationwide polls before the implosion of Johnson's premiership and his successor Liz Truss's disastrous 49-day tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With almost all those results in by Saturday morning, they had lost close to half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If replicated in a nationwide contest, the initial tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points, according to the BBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky News' projection for a general election using the results predicted Labour will be the largest party but short of an overall majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its by-election scalp in Blackpool -- on a mammoth 26-percent swing -- was the Conservatives' 11th such loss in this parliament, the most by any government since the late 1960s. (AFP)

 Turkey said on Friday it will not resume trade with Israel, worth US$7 billion a year, until a permanent ceasefire and humanitarian aid are secured in Gaza, becoming the first of Israel's key commercial partners to take such a step.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's "uncompromising attitude" and the worsening situation in Gaza's Rafah region, a refuge for displaced people that Israel has threatened to storm - prompted Ankara to halt all exports and imports, Trade Minister Omer Bolat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz criticised Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's move, enacted late on Thursday, saying it breaks international trade agreements and was "how a dictator behaves".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, praised the decision as brave and supportive of Palestinian rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Turkey curbed exports of steel, fertiliser and jet fuel among 54 product categories over what it said was Israel's refusal to allow Ankara to take part in aid air-drop operations for Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new ban covers all remaining trade, amounting to US$5.4 billion in Turkish exports - or nearly 6 percent of all of Israel's imports - and US$1.6 billion in imports to Turkey last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top Turkish exports to Israel are steel, vehicles, plastics, electrical devices and machinery, while imports are dominated by fuels at US$634 million last year, Turkish trade data show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey has denounced Israel's military campaign in Gaza, sent thousands of tons of aid for Gazans and, this week, said it would join South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

 US President Joe Biden on Friday awarded the country's top civilian honour to Oscar-winning Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh and 18 other people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a ceremony at the White House, the 81-year-old Biden presented Yeoh and other winners with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by placing the award around their necks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House praised Yeoh for continuing to "shatter stereotypes and enrich American culture," as the 61-year-old actress became the first Asian woman to win the best actress Oscar for her performance in "Everything Everywhere All at Once" last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners of the Presidential Medal of Freedom include Biden's Democratic allies - former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, former vice president Al Gore, former secretary of state John Kerry, and former New York mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said the winners have made exemplary contributions to the US, and the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are the pinnacle of leadership in their fields. They consistently demonstrated over their careers the power of community, hard work, and service." Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden himself received the medal of freedom days before former US president Donald Trump entered the White House in January 2017. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Canada charges Indian trio over Sikh activist murder

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police said on Friday they had arrested and charged three Indian nationals with the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 and said they were probing possible links to the Indian government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, 45, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said the matter was still under investigation and other probes were being carried out. These "include investigating connections to the government of India," he told a televised news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a "terrorist".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States. (Reuters)

    Flood-ravaged Kenya braces for first ever cyclone

    <![CDATA[<img alt="William Rutto warns in an address to the nation that Kenya's severe weather is likely to continue. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751706_1_20240504012715.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and landslides across Kenya in recent weeks, killing at least 210 people, are forecast to worsen over the rest of this month, President William Ruto said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The floods have wreaked havoc, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other infrastructure across Kenya, East Africa's largest economy. The death toll exceeds that from floods triggered by the El Nino weather phenomenon late last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sadly, we have not seen the last of this perilous period, as the situation is expected to escalate. Meteorological reports paint a dire picture," Ruto said on Kenyan television. "Kenya may face its first-ever cyclone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyclone Hidaya is expected to make landfall in Tanzania, Kenya's southern neighbour, on Saturday, bringing with it waves almost eight metres high and 165 kph winds, the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Floods have killed more than 160 people in Tanzania since the beginning of April, Tanzania's government spokesman Mobhare Matinyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This cyclone, named Hidaya, that could hit anytime now, is predicted to cause torrential rain, strong winds and powerful and dangerous waves," Ruto said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Ruto ordered those living in landslide-prone areas to leave for safer ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has asked people living near 178 dams and water reservoirs, now close to overflowing, as well as those in informal settlements close to rivers and streams, to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said the reopening of all schools for the upcoming term, which was meant to start this week, would be postponed until further notice. (Reuters)

    Orangutan seen apparently treating wound

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A male Sumatran orangutan named Rakus is seen two months after wound self-treatment using a medicinal plant. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751628_1_20240503133421.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists have observed an orangutan applying medicinal herbs to a face wound in an apparently successful attempt to heal an injury, the first time such behaviour has been recorded.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Primates have previously been seen eating plants or rubbing them on themselves in behaviour scientists theorised was intended to ward off disease or discomfort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the apparent treatment seen by researchers in Indonesia in 2022, and reported in the journal Nature Scientific Reports on Thursday, is the first time a wild animal has been seen applying medicinal plants to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists were tracking a male orangutan nicknamed Rakus at the Gunung Leuser National Park in Indonesia's Aceh province when they noticed an open wound on his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three days later, they spotted him chewing the leaves of a vine called Fibraurea tinctoria, which is known for its medicinal properties and has long been used in local traditional medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The orangutan "began chewing the leaves without swallowing them and using his fingers to apply the plant juice from his mouth directly onto his facial wound," said the study by Indonesian and German scientists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When flies began to land on the site, Rakus "smeared the entire wound with the plant pulp until the red flesh was fully covered with the green leaf material."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next day, Rakus was seen eating the vine's leaves again, and a week later his wound had closed up, subsequently healing without any sign of infection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study describes the behaviour as the "first systematically documented case of active wound treatment with a plant species known to contain biologically active substances by a wild animal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said it was impossible to be sure the behaviour was intentional, but the fact that the juice and leaves were applied repeatedly and only to the wound suggests Rakus was trying to treat his injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They speculate the orangutan could have stumbled across the treatment, perhaps by first chewing the plant and then finding the juice offered pain relief when accidently touching it to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orangutans are known to learn skills from each other through observation, but the scientists said they had no record of similar behaviour in 21 years and 28,000 observation hours in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rakus however had moved to the region from elsewhere, raising the possibility he learned the medical technique from a different community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observation adds to a growing body of evidence about the way primates use plants to keep healthy, including swallowing whole leaves that have anti-parasitic properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in Indonesia, orangutans have been seen rubbing the chewed leaves of a different plant into their skin, possibly to harness its anti-inflammatory properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in 2022, scientists reported on chimpanzees in Gabon that were seen apparently applying insects to wounds. (AFP)
