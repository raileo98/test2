<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump won formal nomination Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist for running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of last weekend's failed assassination attempt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump announced 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his vice presidential pick, rewarding a one-time harsh critic who became one of his most reliable - and uncompromising - supporters in Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 78, is guaranteed a hero's welcome at the convention in Milwaukee, where delegates delivered their formal nomination two days after the scandal-plagued former president survived an assassination attempt at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," Trump posted on Truth Social.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vance had been widely expected as Trump's pick. He will bolster the ticket on the right wing, but with less chance of expanding appeal to more moderate voters and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The standard-bearer for a new kind of populism that has come to the fore under Trump, Vance is also one of the least experienced VP picks in modern history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he embraces the ex-president's isolationist, anti-immigration America First movement. Vance is further to the right than his new boss on many issues including abortion, where he embraces calls for federal legislation. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people in Madrid welcomed Spain's squad home on Monday after they beat England to win Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After receptions with King Felipe VI and prime minister Pedro Sanchez, La Roja were paraded through the capital city on an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was adorned with the message "it's only the beginning" and the trophy sat at the front of the bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want a lot," Sanchez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want more," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The likes of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Sunday's match-winner in Berlin, Mikel Oyarzabal, wore white t-shirts with the number four on them in reference to the record number of times Spain have won the European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For now, we're not realising yet what we have accomplished," Williams said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacker, who scored the opening goal of the 2-1 victory, was also eager to thank Spain's fans "for the love and warmth they brought the team".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team bus took them to Plaza Cibeles in central Madrid where thousands more fans waited to celebrate the success, following on from victories in 1964, 2008 and 2012. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a car bombing at a cafe in Somalia's capital Mogadishu that was packed with football fans watching the the Euro 2024 final has risen to nine, security sources said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Witnesses described scenes of panic and chaos after the powerful blast late on Sunday, with people scrambling for safety and the main entrance to the cafe destroyed by the blaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Yusuf, an official from the national security agency, said nine civilians were killed and 20 others wounded in the explosion, raising the official toll of five given by police late on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The popular Top Coffee restaurant, which is located near the presidential palace in the centre of the city, was thronged with young men watching the final that Spain won 2-1 against England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were many people inside the restaurant, most of them youth who were watching the football match... but thanks to God, most of them made their way out safely after using ladders to climb up and jump over the backside perimeter wall," Yusuf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the state-run Somali National News Agency said Sunday it was carried out by Al-Qaeda linked Al-Shabaab jihadists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images posted online showed a huge fireball and plumes of smoke billowing into the night sky as the explosion ripped through the cafe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was inside the restaurant watching the football match when I heard a huge explosion, there was smoke, dust and fire at the front side of the restaurant and we panicked," Said Muktar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I and several other people rushed towards the main entrance, but it was completely inaccessible," he said, adding that the "whole situation was chaos".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images of the aftermath of the bombing on Monday showed piles of rubble where the restaurant once stood and several burnt-out vehicles, as local residents inspected the scene. (AFP)

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761717_1_20240715224718.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Florida judge appointed by Donald Trump has dismissed the criminal case against the former president on charges of mishandling top secret documents, saying the way that Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed was improper.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision is a huge victory for Trump, who had been accused of endangering national security by holding onto top secret documents after leaving the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Aileen Cannon made her ruling after lawyers for the 78-year-old argued for a partial stay of proceedings to allow for an assessment of a Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Former President Trump's Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on the Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith is GRANTED," Aileen wrote in her order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Superseding Indictment is DISMISSED because Special Counsel Smith's appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Trump is set to be annointed as his party's champion at the Republican National Convention, days after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Florida case, Trump was facing 31 counts of "willful retention of national defense information," each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also faced charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden sought to calm a divided nation after his rival Donald Trump survived an assassination bid, saying in a rare Oval Office address on Sunday it was time to lower the temperature of America's hostile politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "You know, the political record in this country has gotten very heated. It's time to cool it down," Biden said in the televised speech, just the third he has given from behind the historic Resolute Desk during his presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the country reeled from images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania, Biden added that US politics "must never be a literal battlefield, a, God forbid, a killing field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old Democrat said that both sides had a responsibility to ease the situation ahead of a deeply divided election that would now be a "time of testing" for the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators said that they were still probing the motives of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot dead by snipers at the event in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday after firing multiple shots with a legally-bought semi-automatic rifle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former president Trump said on social media on Sunday that Americans should not allow "evil to win," adding it was "more important than ever that we stand United." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The civil defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said Sunday that 15 people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering war displaced where the Israeli military said it had targeted "terrorists".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike on the UN-run Abu Araban site in central Gaza's Nuseirat camp was the fifth on a school-turned-shelter in eight days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Abu Araban school was housing "thousands of displaced people," civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said, adding that most of the dead were women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools in Nuseirat were the target for two of the earlier school strikes as Israel keeps up its offensive against Hamas Palestinian militants who triggered the war with their October 7 attack on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its air force "struck a number of terrorists who were operating in the area of UNRWA's Abu Araban school building in Nuseirat".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the building had "served as a hideout" and base for "attacks" on Israeli troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel says Hamas uses schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure for military purposes. Hamas denies the accusation. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight female bodies have been recovered so far from a dumpsite in a Nairobi slum, Kenyan police said on Sunday, adding that they were pursuing possible links to cults, serial killers or rogue medical practitioners.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gruesome discoveries of mutilated and dismembered bodies dumped in plastic bags in a rubbish tip in Mukuru in the south of the Kenyan capital have horrified and angered the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's acting national police chief Douglas Kanja said the first six corpses were found on Friday and more body parts were retrieved on Saturday, with preliminary investigations revealing that all were female.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were severely dismembered in different states of decomposition and left in sacks," Kanja told a press conference, adding that investigations were ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kanja also called for public cooperation in "so that we bring the perpetrators of these heinous acts to book".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amin Mohammed, the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, said the ages of the victims ranged between about 18 to 30 and that all had been killed and butchered in the same manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police were looking into a number of hypotheses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Are we dealing with a cult that is associated with criminal activities, are we dealing with serial killers," he said at the press briefing alongside Kanja.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We even could be dealing with rogue medical practitioners [involved in] criminal activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya was left reeling last year by the discovery of mass graves in a forest near the Indian Ocean coast containing the bodies of more than 400 members of a doomsday sect, one of the world's worst cult-related massacres. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slammed South Korean "scum" on Sunday for launching anti-regime propaganda leaflets across the border via balloon, warning they would pay "a very high price".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Korean peninsula has seen tit-for-tat balloon campaigns in recent weeks, with Pyongyang floating trash-filled balloons southward in protest of ones carrying propaganda leaflets sent northward by South Korean activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim Yo Jong, a key regime spokesperson, said she was informed the latest batch of "dirty leaflets and things of the ROK scum" had been found in North Korean territory along the border, according to a statement carried in English by the official Korean Central News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ROK is an abbreviation of South Korea's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korean military personnel were "now making an all-out search, throwing into fire and disposing of the found rubbishes", she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the ROK scum are not stopping this crude and dirty play," she added, using the initials of the North's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ROK clans will be tired from suffering a bitter embarrassment and must be ready for paying a very high price."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang has already sent more than a thousand balloons carrying trash southward in what it says is retaliation for balloons carrying propaganda criticising Kim Jong Un's rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Seoul has fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The French armed forces will take an unusual detour at the start of their annual Bastille Day march on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations to host the Olympic Games blocked the national day parade from its traditional route on the Champs Elysees, and a smaller military contingent will instead march on the nearby Avenue Foch - one of the most prestigious streets in Paris and one of the most expensive addresses in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All eyes will be on the host, President Emmanuel Macron, who last year cut a more impressive figure, hosting rising superpower India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi at France's triumphant national day parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, with the Olympics just around the corner, France has no international star guest for this year's parade - and French political leaders' minds will be elsewhere, pondering the power vacuum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This month's snap elections, called by Macron to clarify France's direction after the far right sent shock-waves through the political establishment by coming first in European polls, left the country without a ruling minority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against this backdrop, the reduced and rerouted parade risks becoming a new symbol of drift, even with the addition of the arrival in Paris of the Olympic Torch, ahead of the July 26 to August 11 Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No tank or armoured vehicle will take part, and only 4,000 foot soldiers will march, down from 6,500 last year, but the military fly-past will see 45 aeroplanes and 22 helicopters soar over Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regiments honoured on the parade will include those from France's allies and former French colonies that took part in the country's 1944 World War II liberation 80 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parade's final section will also honour the Olympic spirit.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Ryan Leung is the first person from the SAR to successfully swim across the North Channel, between Ireland and Scotland, one of the marathon swimming challenges of the Oceans Seven.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 35-year-old swam 40 kilometres in 14 hours and 5 minutes with the swim ratified by the Irish Long Distance Swimming Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an Instagram post, the swimmer said he spent more than three hours on the last seven kilometres due to the current.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also wrote: "not fast but once again my fat is proven life-saving – average water temperature is 12.7 degrees Celsius, but I am sure most of it was 11 degrees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who used the challenge to raise funds for charities supporting grassroots youth development, thanked his fans for all their support.

    Trump safe after shots fired at rally: Secret Service

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secret Service said former president Donald Trump was "safe" after he was rushed off stage when gunshots were fired at a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the bangs rang out, 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspected shooter was confirmed dead, along with one bystander, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The former president is safe," the Secret Service said in a post on X, and his campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," said spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in a bitter replay of their 2020 clash, said there was "no place for this kind of violence in America".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well," Biden said in a statement, adding: "I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old, staying at his house in Rehoboth, Delaware, gave a televised statement repeating his message, saying "we cannot be like this".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. (AFP)

    UK's Labour party to focus on 'turbo charging growth'

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761499_1_20240714060120.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's incoming Labour government will focus on measures to "turbo charge growth" when it unveils its legislative plans at next week's King's Speech, prime minister Keir Starmer said in comments released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "From energy, to planning, to unbreakable fiscal rules, my government is serious about delivering the stability that is going to turbo charge growth that will create wealth in every corner of the UK," said Starmer, whose party won a huge landslide earlier this month, ending 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our work is urgent. There is no time to waste. We are hitting the ground running by bringing forward the laws we will need to rebuild our country for the long-term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The task of national renewal will not be easy... but the legislation set out at the King's Speech will build on the momentum of our first days in office and make a difference to the lives of working people," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charles III will deliver the King's Speech on Wednesday, as parliament formally reopens after the July 4 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite its name, the address is not written by the monarch but by the government which uses it to detail the laws it proposes to make over the coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it was working on more than 35 bills "to deliver an ambitious parliamentary session that will be built on a bedrock of economic security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include measures to enforce public spending rules and others to prevent a repeat of the utility bill price hikes that triggered the UK's recent cost-of-living crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislation will also flesh out announcements already made this week, such as the launching of a fund to draw investment into the UK and of a body tasked with boosting clean power by 2030, as well as the opening of recruitment for a new border security command. (AFP)

    Sanders voices support for Biden's candidacy
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"For the sake of our kids and future generations, he must win," says independent Senator Bernie Sanders, right, seen here with US President Joe Biden. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761497_1_20240714054229.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senator Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure of the US political left, on Saturday threw his support behind Joe Biden's White House campaign, dismissing calls for the president to withdraw from the race over health concerns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Enough! Mr Biden may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate," independent senator Sanders wrote in a New York Times column, adding that "it's time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders's column comes amid steadily growing calls from Democratic officials and donors for the 81-year-old Biden to step aside following a disastrous performance in his June 27 debate with former president Donald Trump. So far, some 20 members of Congress have called for him to leave the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls taken since the debate show Trump with a national lead over Biden, though within the margin of error. They also show some key battleground states, including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, shifting in the Republican's favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a majority of Americans – including Democrats – believe Biden is too old to serve again, according to a recent poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president did not help his own cause when, at a summit in Washington earlier this week, he mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as his foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, however, insisted during an appearance on Friday that he is, and will remain, his party's flagbearer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am running and we're going to win," he told an enthusiastic audience in Detroit, amid chants of "Don't you quit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate and Vice President Kamala Harris doubled down her support for Biden, calling him a "fighter" at a campaign event on Saturday in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where Trump is also holding a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, we will continue to fight. We will continue to organise. And in November, we will win," said Harris, who some pundits have speculated could lead the Democratic ticket if Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seeking to allay concerns, Biden spoke with members of the Democratic Party's left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus in a virtual meeting on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will also sit for interviews next week with NBC News and Black Entertainment Television (BET).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders, who at 82 is himself seeking reelection to the Senate in November, did acknowledge the signs of the president's aging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But given Biden's achievements – and the record of Trump, "who has 34 felony convictions and... has told thousands of documented lies" – the senator brushed Biden's shortcomings aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, I know," he wrote. "Mr Biden is old, is prone to gaffes, walks stiffly and had a disastrous debate with Mr Trump. But this I also know: A presidential election is not an entertainment contest. It does not begin or end with a 90-minute debate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed the eruption of anti-Biden rhetoric partly on "the corporate media (which) has obsessively focused on the June presidential debate and the cognitive capabilities of a man who has, perhaps, the most difficult and stressful job in the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders also blamed those Democrats who he said had "joined that circular firing squad."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He challenged the president to do more – to "propose and fight for a bold agenda" that would help lift working families "who have been left behind for far too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden, he concluded, was "a good and decent Democratic president with a record of real accomplishment," including helping rebuild the US economy and shoring up the country's crumbling infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the sake of our kids and future generations, he must win." (AFP)

    Baldwin thanks supporters after early end to trial

<div class="itemFullText">
 Alec Baldwin made his first public comments to thank his supporters on Saturday after the stunning early end to his involuntary manslaughter trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now," Baldwin said in a brief Instagram post that accompanied a photo of him sitting in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, courtroom. “To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor wept a day earlier when Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case three days into the trial and said he could not be criminally charged again in the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Neither he nor his lawyers spoke to reporters as he left the courthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evidence that sank the case was ammunition that was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammunition unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers alleged they “buried” it and filed a motion to dismiss the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge said the withholding of the evidence tainted the “fundamental fairness” of the trial of the 66-year-old Baldwin, who could have gotten 18 months in prison if he were convicted. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel had declared Al-Mawasi a "safe zone" as it pushed into Rafah near the Egyptian border, but on Saturday Palestinians raced to collect dozens of casualties from the military's latest strike.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sirens wailed and women screamed as children were pulled bloody and unmoving from the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What have they done? they're children, children," one woman cried. "Seven-year-old and 12-year-old children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Mawasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people had sought refuge, was left a chaos-strewn wasteland by one of the deadliest Israeli strikes since the start of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas-run territory's health ministry said at least 90 people were killed, half of them women and children. It said another 300 people were wounded in the "massacre".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an attack in the Khan Younis area had targeted Hamas military strategist Mohammed Deif and Rafa Salama, a brigade commander, but there was "no certainty that the two were eliminated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located near the city of Khan Younis, Al-Mawasi was designated a humanitarian area after Israel in May ordered civilians to evacuate from other parts of the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been warning for months that there is no safe place for anyone in Gaza amid Israel's military bombardment," said UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians, which operates health sites in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said hundreds of thousands of displaced people were sheltering in the "safe zone," which had been targeted before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Black smoke billowed behind a wide, ash-strewn street in Al-Mawasi where bodies lay in pools of blood, some covered by sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Men struggling to carry the wounded wove through those beyond help to reach ambulances waiting with open doors. Others were piled onto donkey-pulled carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are people who have lost limbs everywhere. It's a scene the mind cannot even imagine," Mahmoud Chahine said near a market struck in the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the Nasser Hospital reportedly saying it was at full capacity, ambulances kept arriving, carting in the wounded on orange stretchers, including a man with a towel tied around his leg as a makeshift tourniquet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman outside the hospital could be heard pleading: "Please enough, enough for God's sake."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said the attack against Deif "struck an open area" that "was not a tent complex but an operational compound."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our information, only Hamas terrorists were present and there were no civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Netanyahu's office, he had discussed the strike with security and military officials as part of his goal "to eliminate senior Hamas officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called the claim that Deif had been targeted "false allegations" intended "to cover up the magnitude of the horrific massacre" in Al-Mawasi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said heavy fire was preventing its teams from reaching the "many bodies" scattered in the streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmoud Abu Akar, an eyewitness, described repeated missiles raining down on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time people tried to get close to rescue others, they would strike," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was no warning at all, it happened all of a sudden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since telling people to relocate to Al-Mawasi in May, the Israeli military has been accused of repeatedly striking the area in deadly attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June the International Committee of the Red Cross said 22 people were killed by shelling that damaged its office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Returning from the Nasser Hospital on Saturday, Louise Wateridge, from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said children had suffered life-changing injuries and people were angry there was no reprieve from the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no safety here, no matter where people go," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's strike came on the 281st day of the war that was unleashed by Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, which resulted in 1,195 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military reprisal has killed at least 38,443 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday his government had "no certainty" that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in a strike that officials in Hamas-run Gaza said killed dozens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israel attacked Gaza today in an attempt to eliminate Mohammed Deif and his deputy, Rafa Salama," Netanyahu told a press conference hours after the attack on Al-Mawasi, a designated safe zone in Gaza's south sheltering displaced Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no certainty that the two were eliminated," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, at least 71 people were killed and nearly 300 wounded in the strike on Al-Mawasi, near the southern city of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had designated the area a safe zone and told civilians in other areas in Gaza to go there for safety.

  Netanyahu described Deif, head of the Hamas military wing, as "the planner and leader" of the October 7 attack that set off the Gaza war.

  Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and bring back all hostages from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The elimination of the heads of Hamas advances the achievement of all our objectives," said the right-wing premier who faces mounting opposition to the conduct of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent weeks, we have identified clear cracks within Hamas," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's operation also contributes to this, regardless of what its outcomes will be." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lavish wedding celebrations for the son of Asia's richest man resumed on Saturday with a star-studded guest list including Hollywood celebrities, global business leaders and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani's youngest son Anant and his fiancee Radhika Merchant, both 29, are tying the knot over the weekend in Mumbai following months of pre-marriage parties that have set a new benchmark in matrimonial extravagance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's itinerary included a blessing ceremony during which the world's rich and famous greeted the couple at the wedding venue, a 16,000-capacity convention centre owned by the Ambani family's conglomerate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage from inside shared by local broadcasters showed Modi, whose policies have been warmly supported by the groom's father over his decade in power, was among the guests to pay their respects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event followed a formal ceremony and party on Friday attended by the likes of socialite Kim Kardashian, actor John Cena, and former British premiers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA boss Gianni Infantino, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and Samsung chairman Jay Y Lee were among the hundreds of other famous figures present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Best wishes to the new couple and double happiness!" Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong posted on social media platform X along with footage of the couple from inside the venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This weekend's celebrations end on Sunday with a reception party, and cap months of extravagant pre-wedding festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier events this year included a party at the Ambanis' ancestral home where a purpose-built Hindu temple was unveiled, and private performances by R&B star Rihanna and Canada's Justin Bieber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guests at that gala included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former US president Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, along with a who's who of India's sporting and entertainment worlds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, the couple embarked on a four-day Mediterranean cruise along with 1,200 guests, with singer Katy Perry performing at a masquerade ball at a French chateau in Cannes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mumbai this year overtook Beijing to become the Asian city with the most billionaires, according to a Chinese research institute survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite India being the world's fastest growing economy, the gap between rich and poor remains vast. More than half of the country's 1.4 billion people live on less than four dollars per day, according to World Bank figures from 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the wedding and its VIP attendees have been the subject of relentless and laudatory media coverage in India, the reaction among the public has been mixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They must have spent over US$60 million, while I will struggle to earn just US$400 this month," said Mumbai general store worker Jitesh Ingle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But this is our life. What can we do? We can only watch their celebrations on YouTube."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anant's father Mukesh is chairman of Reliance Industries, a family-founded conglomerate that has grown into India's biggest company by market cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patriarch is the world's 11th richest person with a fortune of more than US$123 billion, according to Forbes, and is no stranger to making a statement when it comes to family marriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He held the most expensive wedding in India to date for his daughter in 2018, which reportedly cost US$100 million and saw US singer Beyonce perform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family's lucrative interests include retail partnerships with Armani and other luxury brands, more than 40 percent of India's mobile phone market and an Indian Premier League cricket team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 27-floor family home Antilia is one of Mumbai's most prominent landmarks, reportedly costing more than US$1 billion to build and with a permanent staff of 600 servants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchant is the daughter of well-known pharmaceutical moguls. (AFP)

    Imran Khan's illegal marriage conviction overturned

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, however, have now been arrested on a new graft charge. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761484_1_20240714010400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court overturned ex-prime minister Imran Khan's conviction on illegal marriage charges on Saturday, though he remains jailed after fresh charges were swiftly brought against him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Khan was slapped with a trio of convictions in the days before February elections – cases he says were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cases have now all been at least partially rolled back on appeal, with a treason conviction carrying a decade jail term overturned in April, and a 14-year graft sentence suspended in June, though the conviction still stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi had also been sentenced to seven years for allegedly marrying too soon after her divorce, in a breach of Islamic law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an Islamabad judge announced on Saturday that the couple's appeals were accepted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan remains locked up, though, with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party saying a court in eastern Lahore had approved his arrest over three cases alleging he incited riots in May 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spokesman Ahmed Janjua said it was "yet another gimmick to keep the illegal imprisonment prolonged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, PTI said Khan and Bibi had also been arrested on a separate graft case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month a UN panel of experts found Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose," it said, calling for his immediate release after nearly a year in jail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted after falling out with the military establishment, which wields huge influence over civilian politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In opposition he waged a campaign of defiance against the generals, who directly ruled Pakistan for decades of its history, even accusing them of being behind an assassination attempt that wounded him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the former cricket star's comeback was hobbled by scores of legal cases, which analysts say were likely brought at the behest of the military establishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan was first briefly arrested in May 2023, sparking nationwide unrest from PTI supporters, some of which targeted military facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government and military cited the attacks as justification for a sweeping crackdown on PTI, which saw its senior leadership decimated by arrests and defections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PTI candidates were forced to stand as independents in the February 8 elections, which had been repeatedly delayed amid political chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan's arrest and conviction for graft in August 2023 meant he was barred from standing for office himself, confined to a cell in Adiala Jail south of Islamabad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the setbacks, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless they were blocked from power by a broad coalition of military-backed rival parties, amid widespread allegations of vote-tampering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gallup Pakistan analyst Bilal Gilani said the rolling back of the cases against Khan now could suggest the establishment was softening its stance in the wake of the election – or that the courts were defying their attempts to keep him confined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an important judgement, because essentially now there are a limited number of cases left," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Immediate release is quite impossible, but... the chances of release are getting clearer by the day," he added. (AFP)

    Kremlin warns US missiles could make Europe a target

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Saturday warned the deployment of US missiles in Germany could make European capitals targets for Russian missiles in a repeat of Cold War-style confrontation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke of a "paradox" in which "Europe is a target for our missiles, our country is a target for US missiles in Europe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have enough capacity to contain these missiles but the potential victims are the capitals of these countries," he said, speaking to Russian state television channel Russia 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peskov also hinted that such a confrontation could undermine Europe as a whole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Europe is not living its best moment. In a different configuration, a repeat of history is inevitable," he said when the channel's anchor Pavel Zarubin pointed out that the Cold War had ended with the Soviet Union's collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House announced on Wednesday during a Nato summit that it would periodically station long-range weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles in Germany from 2026 as a deterrent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exercising these advanced capabilities will demonstrate the United States' commitment to Nato and its contributions to European integrated deterrence," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin criticised the move, accusing Washington of taking a step towards a new Cold War and of directly participating in the conflict in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov held a telephone call with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin where they discussed lowering the risk of "possible escalation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato countries – spearheaded by the United States – have bolstered their defences in Europe following the start of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine in 2022. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Saturday arrested a man after two suitcases believed to contain the remains of two men were dumped on a famous bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suitcases were discovered on Wednesday after police got a report of a man behaving suspiciously on the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, southwest England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Detectives have arrested a man in connection with an investigation into the discovery of human remains on Clifton Suspension Bridge," said the Metropolitan Police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old suspect was detained in Bristol and will be taken to London for questioning later on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Metropolitan Police said the victims have not been formally identified, but both are believed to be men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-based force took over the investigation after evidence suggested that the wanted man had travelled to Bristol from the UK capital earlier on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clifton Suspension Bridge, designed by the pioneering engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is one of the oldest surviving suspension bridges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opened in 1864, the bridge over the Avon Gorge is one of Bristol's top tourist attractions and a symbol of the city. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepali rescue teams on Saturday recovered the first body from around 50 people missing after monsoon rains triggered a landslide that swept two buses off a highway and into a river.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force of Friday's landslide in central Chitwan district pushed the vehicles over concrete crash barriers and down a steep embankment, at least 30 metres from the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One body has been found about 55 kilometres from the accident site," said police spokesman Kumar Neupane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District official Khimananda Bhusal said that roughly 50 people remained unaccounted for, revising down the number of missing from the 63 reported by authorities on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to confirm the total number because we don't know if the buses stopped to add or remove passengers along the way," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of rescuers spent hours struggling to comb the raging Trishuli river with rafts, sensor equipment and dive teams to find any trace of the passengers or the vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teams on Saturday also moved downstream in hope of locating the missing passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fierce currents made worse by this week's torrential downpours have hampered their efforts so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chitwan district chief Indra Dev Yadav said that all authorities in the area have been instructed to stay on alert for any signs of the missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The river is narrow here and very deep," he said. "The water level is high, its speed is high and its turbidity is also high."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accident happened before dawn on Friday along the Narayanghat-Mugling highway, around 100 kilometres west of Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One bus was heading from the capital to Gaur in Rautahat district in southern Nepal, and the other was en route to Kathmandu from southern Birgunj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A driver was killed in a separate accident on the same road after a boulder hit his bus. He died as he was being treated at a hospital. (AFP)

 The health ministry in Gaza said an Israeli strike on a displacement camp in the south of the Palestinian territory killed at least 71 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 280 others were injured in the strike on Al-Mawasi camp, the ministry said, condemning a "brutal massacre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as the Israeli military pursued attacks in central Gaza with artillery fire and drone strikes, while Palestinian medics said one bombing killed a father and his three daughters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestine Red Crescent medics said the strike on a home in Deir al-Balah city killed Rital al-Raey, five, Mai, eight, Leila, nine and their 40-year-old father Mohammed al-Raey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their bodies were taken to the city's Al-Aqsa hospital, the medical workers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Civil Defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that Israeli forces had withdrawn from Tal al-Hawa and other districts, after days of fighting. It said at least 60 bodies had been found in Tal al-Hawa and a neighbouring area after the withdrawal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the agency said 60 bodies had been found in nearby Shujaiya after Israel ended an operation there. Israel's military said it had killed 150 militants in Shujaiya during a two-week operation against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday the army said operations were continuing in Gaza City as well as "targeted, intelligence-based" missions in Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip. (AFP)

    Biden hits campaign trail as calls to quit pile up

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At least President Zelensky, a former comedian, could see the funny side of Joe Biden's gaffe at the Nato summit. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761395_1_20240713021914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden returns to the campaign trail on Friday, pushing ahead with his reelection bid after a mixed performance at a major news conference failed to silence calls for him to quit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old will give a speech bashing rival Donald Trump in Detroit in the rust-belt state of Michigan, a crucial battleground state that the Democrat must win in November's election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A defiant Biden insisted in a pivotal appearance at a Nato summit on Thursday that he would run again, and win – despite concerns about his age and health following a disastrous debate performance two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a series of gaffes, including referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as "Vice President Trump," kept Biden's fitness for a second term under the microscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, said he had met with Biden late on Thursday, as the number of members calling on the president to step aside rose to 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeffries said he and Biden "expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward" but did not give further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president has faced a steady drumbeat of Democrats calling for him to abandon his 2024 candidacy since the June 27 debate, during which Biden often lost his train of thought and appeared tired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden has obstinately dug in and insists that he can convince voters to back him despite most polls showing him trailing the criminally convicted, twice-impeached Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign event in Detroit is his fourth trip this year to the state, part of the industrial "blue wall" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that were key to his 2020 win against his rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's speech is expected to focus on "Project 2025", a blueprint by hardline conservatives for the first days of a Trump term that Democrats have pinned on the former president, despite the 78-year-old's denials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The press conference on Thursday appeared to buy Biden some time even if it was far from a knockout blow, with three more lawmakers urging him to quit just minutes after it finished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was the "most qualified person to run for president," rejecting calls for him to step aside before the November 5 vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He acknowledged he had to "allay fears" in the Democratic party and should "pace myself a little more" after blaming jet lag and a cold for his stumbling debate performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also fielded a series of foreign and domestic policy questions with detailed if meandering answers and relatively few slip-ups, though he did mix up Europe and Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were damaging moments on Thursday, with the Trump-Harris mixup and an earlier gaffe at the Nato summit in which he introduced Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The concerns over Biden are also affecting Democratic donors, with Hollywood star and high-profile supporter George Clooney calling on Biden to step aside on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of other key donors have told the largest Biden campaign fund that around US$90 million in pledged donations is on hold if he carries on running, the New York Times reported on Friday. (AFP)

    UK to release thousands of inmates due to overcrowding

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of prisoners are to be released early from September in order to prevent the "collapse" of the prisons system, the UK's new justice minister announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shabana Mahmood said failure to do so risked the "total breakdown of law and order," with just 700 places left for men, and jails operating at 99 percent capacity since 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England and Wales have the highest per capita prison population in Western Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said this week that urgent action was required, as prisons were at "breaking point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release initiative would not apply to violent offenders serving more than four years, sex offenders and those in prison for domestic abuse offences as well as those on life sentences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood, appointed last week after Labour's general election win, warned in dramatic language that if prisons ran out of cell space, there could be "van-loads of dangerous people circling the country with nowhere to go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With officers unable to act, criminals could do whatever they want, without consequence. We could see looters running amok, smashing in windows, robbing shops and setting neighbourhoods alight," she said in a speech at a prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In short, if we fail to act now, we face the collapse of the criminal justice system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood accused the previous Conservative government of a "dereliction of duty" regarding the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her comments echoed Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who earlier told reporters while attending a Nato summit in the United States that the ousted Tories were guilty of "gross irresponsibility."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of the problem was worse than we thought," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood's Conservative predecessor in the post, Alex Chalk, had reportedly pressed prime minister Rishi Sunak to impose similar measures before the election, but was overruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Labour's plans, prisoners who are eligible for automatic release after serving half their sentence will be freed earlier than the normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plans involve a temporary reduction of how long prisoners must serve behind bars, from 50 percent to 40 percent of their sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The releases will start in September to give the Prison and Probation Service time to plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood also announced the recruitment of 1,000 additional trainee probation officers by next March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total number of prisoners hit over 87,505 on Friday – of whom 83,755 were men – leaving just 1,451 spaces available, official figures showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of 2023, the average occupancy rate in men's prisons had "routinely been higher than 99 percent," according to the Ministry of Justice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials say the prison system needs a buffer of around 1,425 cell spaces in men's prisons at all time to deal with sudden influxes of inmates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six new prisons to create an extra 20,000 places are being built – of which about 10,000 will be ready by the end of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Prison Governors' Association (PGA) said it welcomed the speed of the new measures while demanding a "full review" and that "the public must never be placed in this position again."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PGA chairman Mark Fairhurst said the measures would free up around 4,500-5,000 more spaces and give prisons around 12 to 18 months before further steps would be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Prison Reform Trust chief executive Pia Sinha said ministers "had the good sense to listen to the advice of its officials and introduce further emergency measures." (AFP)

 At least 16 students were killed on Friday when a school in central Nigeria collapsed on pupils taking exams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trapped students cried for help under the rubble after the Saint Academy school in Jos North district of Plateau State fell in on classrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents desperately looked for their children as rescue workers tried to reach the victims with heavy machinery. Images from the scene showed crowds gathering round a caved-in concrete building and heaps of debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have so far only said "several students" were killed but a witness saw five dead bodies in one hospital morgue and 11 in another. All were wearing school uniforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his mother at his hospital bedside, injured student Wulliya Ibrahim said: "I entered the class not more than five minutes, when I heard a sound, and the next thing is I found myself here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are many in the class, we are writing our exams," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Emergency Management Agency said the two-storey building housing Saint Academy collapsed killing "several students."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had completed the search and rescue operation and would provide details later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chika Obioha, a resident at the scene, said he saw at least eight bodies at the site and that dozens more had been injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone is helping out to see if we can rescue more people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 15 rescued and injured students were admitted to the Our Lady of Apostles Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse but residents said it came after three days of heavy rains in Plateau. (AFP)

 A Russian regional airliner carrying three crew members crashed in a forested area near Moscow on Friday, killing all on board, Russian news agencies reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plane was a Superjet 100 regional jet and was carrying out a "test flight" before crashing near the Russian city of Kolomna, the TASS news agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cause of the crash was not clear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mash, a Telegram channel close to Russian law enforcement, said the plane had been on a test flight after repairs and belonged to Gazpromavia, an airline owned by gas giant Gazprom. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A landslide swept two passenger buses carrying at least 63 people into a swollen river in central Nepal early Friday while continuous rain and more landslides were making rescue efforts difficult.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three survivors apparently swam to safety, but rescuers by late morning had not found any trace of the buses, which likely were submerged and swept downstream in the Trishuli River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy monsoon downpours in the past few days have swollen the waterways and turned their waters murky brown, making it even more difficult to see the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buses were on the key highway connecting the capital to southern parts of Nepal when they were swept away around 3am near Simaltal, about 120 kilometres west of Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More landslides blocked routes to the area in several places, officials said. Additional rescuers and security forces were sent to help with the rescue efforts. Police and army personnel were searching using rubber rafts. Divers with scuba gear were also dispatched, according to the Chitwan district police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One bus was carrying at least 24 people, while the other had at least 42, but more could have boarded en route, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bus was hit by another landslide on Friday morning a short distance away on the same highway. Officials said the driver was killed but it was not clear if there were any other casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was saddened by the news and expressed concern over recent flooding and landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that several government agencies were searching for the missing, in a post on the social media platform X. (AP)

    Biden introduces Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Thursday mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky as "President Putin" before correcting himself at the Nato summit in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Biden said, referring to Zelensky, before correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going to beat President Putin, President Zelensky. I am so focused on beating Putin," Biden said while correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The room at the summit gasped when Biden misidentified Zelensky as Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been under intense scrutiny in recent days and has faced doubts, including from members of his own Democratic Party, about his reelection chances after a weak and faltering performance in a debate late last month against Republican former President Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday, Biden plans to hold a solo press conference at the Nato summit, his first time facing the press alone since November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's remarks on Thursday came as Nato members extended support to Ukraine to combat the Russian assault that began in February 2022.

    Zelensky urges Nato leaders to lift all strike limits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Volodymyr Zelensky is calling on Kyiv's backers to allow his outgunned forces greater scope to strike deeper inside Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761250_1_20240712052011.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called on Nato leaders to drop all restrictions on letting Kyiv strike inside Russia with Western weaponry as they wrapped up a three-day summit in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled 75th anniversary gala in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Moscow and backing for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gathering has been overshadowed by uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden – who will give a press conference on Thursday – fights for his own political survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian leader joined his Nato counterparts after receiving promises of new air defences for Ukraine and as allies began the transfer of long-promised F-16 jets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zelensky called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further – including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to win, if we want to prevail, if we want to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key allies such as Washington and Germany relaxed conditions on Ukraine hitting inside Russia in May in response to Moscow's offensive toward the second city Kharkiv, but they kept in place some limits on how far and under which circumstances Kyiv could strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only way to hit military targets, missile launchers or airfields which are conducting attacks against Ukraine is to hit military targets on Russian territory, because the frontline and the borderline is more or less the same," Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato allies have put together a package of support for Ukraine including the pledge of more Patriot missile systems to defend the skies over the war-torn country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky said he hoped to see the air defenses – including one new Patriot system from the United States – delivered "as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato's leaders at the summit once again risked disappointing Zelensky by refusing to issue Ukraine a clear invitation to join their alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a bid to soften any upset, leaders called Ukraine's path to membership "irreversible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros (US$43 billion) in military support "within the next year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are doing and will continue to do everything to ensure that the day comes when Ukraine is invited and becomes a Nato member, and I am confident we will achieve this," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States on Wednesday also announced an important step to bolster Nato's own deterrence against Russia in Europe by saying it would begin "episodic deployments" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would eventually look to permanently station them in Germany, and the missiles would "have significantly longer range" than current US systems in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed the move and said it would help in "securing peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Kremlin on Thursday struck back, saying it was planning "response measures" to contain the "very serious threat" from Nato, accusing the alliance of being "fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CNN meanwhile reported that the United States foiled a Russian plot earlier this year to assassinate the chief executive of a major German arms maker supplying weaponry to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said he did not want to comment on those specific reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said there has been "a Russian campaign organised by the security services to conduct hostile actions against Nato allies, across the alliance, with sabotage attempts, with cyber attacks, with arson, with different types of hostile actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of this campaign is, of course, to intimidate Nato allies from supporting Ukraine, and what we have seen over the last months that Nato allies have not been intimidated," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the sit-down with Zelensky, Nato shifted attention eastwards by welcoming the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington summit is the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato agreed to several initiatives with the partner countries, including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation, and providing Ukraine with non-lethal help. (AFP)

    'The Shining' actor Shelley Duvall dies aged 75

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Director Stanley Kubrick put Duvall through the ringer to play the part of Wendy Torrance. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761242_1_20240712013345.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shelley Duvall, the versatile actor known for her role in "The Shining" and working relationship with director Robert Altman, died on Thursday aged 75.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citing her partner Dan Gilroy, The Hollywood Reporter said Duvall died in her sleep at her home in Blanco, Texas following complications of diabetes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born July 7, 1949 in Fort Worth, Texas, Duvall was discovered by Altman – the maverick filmmaker known for his rich characters, sharp social criticism and keen satire – who cast her in 1970's dark comedy "Brewster McCloud."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The saucer-eyed actor developed a broad repertoire, breaking through with 1975's "Nashville," and going on to portray memorable and eccentric characters that earned her a smattering of awards including at Cannes for her role in the acclaimed 1977 drama "3 Women."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her career was defined by her work with Altman, who she said she kept working with because "he offers me damn good roles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "None of them have been alike," she told The New York Times in 1977.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn't put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was her role in the film adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" that would become one of her highest profile roles, as she played opposite Jack Nicholson.

  Director Stanley Kubrick put her through the ringer to perform the part of Wendy Torrance in the horror classic that sees a writer husband descend into homicidal madness and terrorise his wife and young son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duvall told People in 1981 the 13-month job was gruelling, and that Kubrick had her "crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will never give that much again. If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one famous scene Nicholson's character tortures Duvall's with a baseball bat, which reportedly took 127 takes to satisfy Kubrick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duvall also made a cameo in 1977's "Annie Hall" by Woody Allen, and played opposite Robin Williams in Altman's 1980 live-action rendition of "Popeye."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later in the 1980s she made her way into children's programming.

  Gilroy – a musician who was part of the Breakfast Club and had dated Madonna – was her longtime partner after the pair met on the 1990 Disney Channel Movie "Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley," The Hollywood Reporter quoted Gilroy as saying. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenyan President William Ruto announced on Thursday the dismissal of almost his entire cabinet and consultations to form a "broad-based government" following widespread anti-government protests.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the move affects all ministers including the attorney-general but excluded prime cabinet secretary and foreign minister Musalia Mudavadi and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said he decided on the dismissals "upon reflection, listening keenly to what the people of Kenya have said and after a holistic appraisal of the performance of my cabinet and its achievements and challenges."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action follows largely peaceful protests led by young Gen-Z Kenyans that have widened into a broader campaign against Ruto and his government, with some demonstrations degenerating into deadly violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto also said he will "immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This government would, he said, help him to develop "radical programmes" to deal with the country's huge debt burden, increase job opportunities, eliminate government waste and "slay the dragon of corruption." (AFP)

    Ex-Indonesian minister gets 10 years in jail for graft

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia’s anti-graft court sentenced a former agriculture minister to 10 years in prison on Thursday after finding him guilty of corruption-related extortion, abuse of power and bribery involving ministry contracts with private vendors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The case has tarnished President Joko Widodo’s credibility in fighting corruption. Five other members of Widodo’s cabinet had been sentenced to prison terms in corruption cases, casting a shadow over his efforts to clean up government before his term ends in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court in the capital, Jakarta, ruled that the former cabinet minister, Syahrul Yasin Limpo, was guilty of abusing his power by enriching himself and other officials. It also ordered him to pay a 300 million rupiah fine, and said he would be subject to another four months’ imprisonment if he fails to pay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The defendant has legally and convincingly been proven guilty of corruption,” presiding Judge Rianto Adam Pontoh said. “He wasn’t a good example as a public official, what he has done is counter the government’s efforts to fight corruption and enriched himself by corruption."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Limpo was arrested last October by the Corruption Eradication Commission, known as the KPK. He has denied wrongdoing. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A rower who waded deep into the Atlantic Ocean has said he had a close encounter with more than 1,000 whales, which swam alongside him for hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  UK-based Tom Waddington, who was 100 nautical miles (185km) off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, also captured the stunning encounter on Sunday on video as he rowed solo to raise money for charity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The images he captured showed the whales swimming around his boat, rocking it as they passed. He expressed both awe and worry during the breathtaking moment at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I love it, but I'm scared they're going to hit my rudder. They're so close, I can hear them. They're blowing bubbles," he said in the video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't believe it. It's an amazing sight, but also so scary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rower on his Instagram said he tried to row away from the huge pod of whales, but they followed him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, they swam alongside him for two hours and eventually left him alone, he said, adding he was safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mr Waddington is undertaking a 2,000 nautical miles journey to raise funds for mental health. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Clooney urges Biden to end 2024 bid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden is hosting the Nato summit in Washington this week. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761092_1_20240711014558.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden suffered a stunning blow on Wednesday when actor and leading Democratic supporter George Clooney urged him to drop his reelection bid, while party heavyweight Nancy Pelosi declined to back his candidacy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I love Joe Biden," Clooney, who hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden just last month, wrote in the New York Times. "But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's bid for a second term in the White House has been under severe pressure since the debate, in which he slurred his words and stood with mouth agape while Trump talked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to turn the page took a leap backwards with the interventions of Pelosi and Clooney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run," she told MSNBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pelosi said Biden should however delay any final decision until after Nato's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which the US president is hosting this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the way to the summit on Wednesday, Biden dropped in on US union leaders in a further bid to shore up backing for his reelection bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's appearances at the Nato gathering are being closely watched as he tries to reassure allies of his continued ability to lead as the alliance backs Ukraine's fight against Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection. A handful of senators have also expressed concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Tuesday, Colorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot – and perhaps cause congressional Democrats to lose as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House," Bennet told CNN, adding he believes the White House "has done nothing" to demonstrate they have a plan to win in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Republican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the biggest cover-up in political history," Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf. (AFP)

    Twelve children killed in S Africa school minibus fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 Twelve children were killed in South Africa on Wednesday when a minibus taking them to school near Johannesburg overturned and burst into flames after being hit by another vehicle, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The driver of the minibus was also killed and seven other children were rushed to hospital, according to officials in Johannesburg's Gauteng province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television images showed that the minibus was totally destroyed by the fire in the early morning crash in Merafong, more than 70 kilometres west of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charred schoolbook pages were scattered on the tarmac, as police examined the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A private scholar transport minibus was involved in a tragic accident in the Kokosi-Wedela area in Merafong, claiming the lives of the 12 learners and their driver," the Gauteng government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could not immediately give the ages of the children but said most were from a primary school, where students are normally aged between six and 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were burnt beyond recognition. When this happens forensics will have to do their part in terms of identification," said Gauteng traffic police department spokesman Sello Maremane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were investigating what happened but it appeared that the minibus was struck from behind by a small pick-up truck, causing it to overturn and catch fire, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver of the pick-up was also in hospital, reports said. By late afternoon, most of the children in hospital had been released, reports said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am profoundly saddened by this tragic event," Gauteng education minister Matome Chiloane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Africa has one of the most developed road networks on the continent but also has one of the worst road safety records, in part due to reckless driving and unroadworthy vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have always said to parents we need to check the condition of the vehicles that we put our kids in," Chiloane said at the scene of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many South African parents have to rely on private minibuses to get their children to school. (AFP)

    Israeli army orders evacuation of war-torn Gaza City

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Deadly Israeli air strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761088_1_20240710235703.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's army dropped thousands of leaflets over war-torn Gaza City on Wednesday urging all residents to flee a heavy offensive through the main city of the besieged Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leaflets, addressed to "everyone in Gaza City," set out designated escape routes and warned that the urban area, which had a pre-war population of over half a million, would "remain a dangerous combat zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The warning came as Israeli troops, backed by tanks and aircraft, have fought Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants in the heaviest combat the city has seen in months in the war raging since October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one operation, the army said it had killed militants and found weapons inside the long-vacated Gaza City headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere across Gaza, deadly strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days, sparking rebukes from France and Germany which both labelled the attacks "unacceptable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We call for these strikes to be fully investigated," said the French foreign ministry, highlighting a deadly strike on Tuesday on a school near the southern city of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unacceptable that schools, especially those housing civilians displaced by the fighting, should be targeted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy fighting also raged in Gaza's far-southern Rafah, where witnesses said that Israeli tanks had rumbled into the city centre and unleashed intense fire on buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest fighting in Gaza has newly displaced 350,000 civilians, said UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini, who spoke before the leaflet drop and said "there is absolutely no safe space in Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One woman carrying her scant belongings through the ruins, Nimr al-Jamal, said that "this is the 12th time" her family has had to flee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How many times can we endure this? A thousand times? Where will we end up?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The upsurge in fighting, bombardment and displacement came as talks were to resume in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal to end the war now grinding on into its 10th month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli delegation led by Mossad chief David Barnea arrived in Doha, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of their sensitivity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CIA director William Burns was also expected in the Qatari capital after holding talks in Cairo on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile met US President Joe Biden's special envoy for the Middle East, Brett McGurk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu "emphasised his commitment" to a proposed truce plan, "as long as Israel's red lines are preserved," his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hawkish premier has repeatedly insisted that the war goals are to defeat Hamas and bring home all hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister's office said "14,000 terrorists have been eliminated" since the beginning of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Yoav Gallant separately told parliament that 60 percent of Hamas fighters had been "eliminated or wounded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The security establishment, and myself heading it, are determined to achieve the goals of the war and complete them," Gallant said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli army said it was reviewing the Khan Younis area attack on Tuesday in which hospital sources said at least 29 people were killed in a school used as a displacement shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's Hamas government said a "majority" of the dead were women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed the wounded being rushed to the nearby Nasser hospital, many screaming in pain, as relatives wailed in grief for the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One wounded man, Osama Abu Daqqa, recounted that "suddenly the strike hit, people were injured and martyred and there was no one to help them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another survivor, Mohamed Sukkar, said those hit in the strike "were not part of the resistance nor were they armed, they were all civilians."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said a strike had hit near the school building and had targeted and killed a Hamas "terrorist" who had taken part in the October 7 attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was "looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al Awda school," which it acknowledged was "near the location of the strike."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The incident is under review."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three previous strikes since Saturday on Gaza schools used by displaced Palestinians have killed a total of at least 20 people, said Gaza officials and rescue services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lazzarini wrote on social media platform X that "schools have gone from safe places of education and hope for children to overcrowded shelters and often ending up a place of death and misery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,295 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has also imposed a punishing siege on Gaza's 2.4 million people, eased only by sporadic aid deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aid group Doctors Without Borders has warned of "critical" shortages of medical supplies in Gaza, with no resupply for more than two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Independent UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign," a claim strongly rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Army spokesman David Baruch on Wednesday said that "the food is getting there, maybe not as much as everyone would want, but I don't see starvation." (AFP)

 UK police were searching on Wednesday for a suspect who may have a crossbow after the wife and two daughters of a BBC radio racing commentator were killed in a suspected "targeted" attack.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyle Clifford, 26, from north London, is wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC confirmed on its news website that the victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, aged 25 and 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local police said officers were called to a house in the town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said armed officers and specialist search teams were involved in the manhunt, urging Clifford to contact police and warning the public not to approach him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simpson called it "a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths "truly shocking" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning," she said. "It's really sad what's happened, very shocking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A union representing tens of thousands of workers at Samsung Electronics in South Korea on Wednesday said it would extend a three-day strike indefinitely in a bid to force management to negotiate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike is the biggest labour action in the tech giant's history and steps up pressure on the chipmaker's management, who last week predicted a huge second-quarter operating profit increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(We) declare a second indefinite general strike from July 10, after learning that the management has no willingness to talk," the National Samsung Electronics Union said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 5,000 members stopped working Monday for what was meant to be a three-day strike, part of a long-running battle over pay and benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows a one-day walkout in June, the first such collective action at the company, which went decades without unionisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union has more than 30,000 members -- more than a fifth of the company's total workforce. (AFP)

    Heavy battles in Gaza City on eve of new truce talks

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Hamas says the fighting in Gaza City is "the most intense in months." Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760931_1_20240710013814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli forces in war-ravaged Gaza City pushed on with a major offensive on Tuesday that has again displaced Palestinians, as UN experts said children were dying in a "starvation campaign."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Troops, tanks and fighter jets swooped on Gaza's biggest urban area on the eve of new contacts in Qatar aiming for an eventual hostage-prisoner exchange and a truce in the war raging into its 10th month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CIA director William Burns and Israel's Mossad chief David Barnea are due to travel to Qatar on Wednesday, after Burns held talks with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas, whose October 7 attack triggered the war, has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of deliberately escalating fighting in Gaza City and Rafah, in the territory's south, to thwart an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamist group's Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh said he had made "urgent contact" with mediators, warning that the "catastrophic consequences" of the latest battles could "reset the negotiation process to square one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, described the fighting in Gaza City in recent days as "the most intense in months."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants were fighting with rockets, mortars and explosives, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two weeks of battles in Gaza City's eastern Shujaiya district, Israeli forces have extended the fighting into the city's east, west and south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents reported helicopter strikes, "explosions and numerous gun battles" in the city's southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it was pursuing Palestinian militants in Gaza City, six months after it said it had dismantled Hamas's "military framework" in the territory's north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aircraft struck the city as troops were engaged in "close-quarters combat," seizing weapons and destroying tunnels, the military said, reporting "dozens" of militants killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said tens of thousands of civilians have been affected by the surge in fighting since the first of three evacuation orders for Gaza City was declared on June 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands were seen marching down dusty roads past bombed-out buildings, with mothers carrying babies and others packing belongings onto donkey carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Human Rights Office said it was "appalled" at the way civilians, many of whom have been displaced multiple times, have been ordered to head to areas where "military operations are ongoing and where civilians continue to be killed and injured."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza City residents have now been told to move south to Deir al-Balah, which the UN office said "is already seriously overcrowded" with displaced Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, independent UN rights experts accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign" that has resulted in the deaths of Gazan children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence," the experts said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thirty-four Palestinians have died from malnutrition since October 7, the majority being children," said the experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva accused the panel's members of "spreading misinformation" and "supporting Hamas propaganda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war started with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,243 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The toll includes at least 50 killed over the past 24 hours, said a ministry statement on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar and Egypt, supported by the United States, have been engaged in months of behind-the-scenes contacts to start truce talks and organise an exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has signalled that it would drop its insistence on a "complete" ceasefire – which Israel had repeatedly rejected – as a condition for starting talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has set out conditions for talks, including that "any deal will allow Israel to return and fight until all the goals of the war are achieved," including the destruction of Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Gaza war has raged on, Israel has also exchanged regular cross-border fire with Lebanon's Hezbollah, allies of Hamas, heightening fears of an all-out war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah on Tuesday released a video showing aerial surveillance footage it said was taken over intelligence and military positions in the Israeli-annexed Syrian Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release came after an Israeli strike killed a senior Hezbollah commander last week. The group's chief Hassan Nasrallah was expected to make a televised address on Wednesday at an event commemorating the slain fighter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Nasrallah on social media to "stop the threats and violence," and "withdraw" Hezbollah forces from the border area, in line with a 2006 UN Security Council resolution that ended their latest major war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Lebanese government has supported the implementation of Resolution 1701, which called for armed personnel to pull back north of the Litani River, some 30 kilometres from the border with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If a full-blown conflict breaks out, Israel's top diplomat said Nasrallah "will be considered the destroyer of Lebanon." (AFP)

    Labour takes governing seats as UK parliament returns

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Keir Starmer addresses the House of Commons for the first time as Britain's prime minister. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760929_1_20240710010917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's new lawmakers excitedly squeezed into parliament on Tuesday with Labour sitting on the government's side of the chamber for the first time in 14 years following last week's landslide election win.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 400 Labour MPs jostled for space on the ruling side of the green-benched House of Commons, with many having to stand, as parliament returned after being dissolved before Thursday's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the house for the first time as Britain's leader, vowing to "put an end to a politics that has too often seemed self-serving and self-obsessed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all have a duty to show that politics can be a force for good," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted the new parliament was "the most diverse parliament by race and gender this country has ever seen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the House of Commons Library, a record 263 or 40 percent of the 650 MPs are women, up from 220 in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 90 are from minority ethnic backgrounds, an increase from 66 five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rishi Sunak – Conservative prime minister until last week – made his first speech as leader of the opposition, and congratulated Starmer on his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described being an MP as the "greatest honour, privilege and responsibility," in a congenial session that contrasted sharply with the usual arguing and shouting seen in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The session started with lawmakers re-electing Lindsay Hoyle as speaker of the house unopposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tradition dictated that he was physically dragged to the speakers' chair by colleagues, a custom rooted in the speaker's original function to communicate the Commons' opinions to the monarch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historically, if the monarch did not agree with the message being communicated then the early death of the speaker could follow – leading to reluctance among some to take up the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the addresses by Starmer and Sunak, other party leaders had their turn, including arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage who declared the five MPs from his anti-immigration Reform UK party the "new kids on the block."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have no experience in this parliament whatsoever, even though some of us have tried many times over the years previously," he said, a reference to his previous seven failed attempts to be elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament then began the lengthy process of swearing in all 650 MPs. Some 335 of them are new to parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are required by law to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the British monarchy and are not allowed to speak in debates, vote or receive their salary until they do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Monday, new MPs have been receiving tours of the parliamentary estate, while some ex-lawmakers who lost their seats last week have been seen saying their goodbyes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour won 411 seats, securing a majority of more than 170 as it returned to power for the first time since Gordon Brown was prime minister in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tories suffered their worst-ever electoral defeat, succumbing to just 121 MPs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak is due to stay in charge of the party until the Conservatives work out the timetable for his successor to be chosen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new parliamentary session will officially begin after Starmer's government puts forward its priorities for the term in the King's speech on Wednesday 17 July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is expected to include the establishment of a new publicly owned investment company called Great British Energy and a plan to renationalise Britain's much-maligned railways. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers resumed the search on Tuesday for 45 people still missing after a landslide at an illegal gold mine on Sulawesi island that killed at least 17 people, an official at the country's search and rescue agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain triggered the disaster on Sunday morning in the district of Suwawa in Gorontalo province, with the landslide engulfing miners and residents living nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salama, an official at Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said rescue efforts restarted on Tuesday after being temporarily halted on Monday due to heavy rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 400 people were involved in the rescue operation, aided by a helicopter, said Salama.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far 52 people had been found alive, though the operation was being hampered by thick mud and with some rescuers having to walk more than 20km to reach the site of the disaster, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said torrential rains that have pounded the mountainous district since Saturday triggered the landslide and broke an embankment, causing floods up to the roofs of houses in five villages in Bone Bolango, which is part of a mountainous district in Gorontalo province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 300 houses were affected and more than 1,000 people fled for safety.
  <br/>

    Nato meets in Washington as questions swirl over Biden

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Leaders of Nato's 32 member countries will meet in Washington for a summit of the transatlantic security alliance, with further military and financial support for Ukraine high on the agenda. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760842_1_20240709120924.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato leaders gather on Tuesday in Washington for a summit aimed at showing resolve against Russia and support for Ukraine – but the meeting is set to be overshadowed by US President Joe Biden's fight for political survival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old leader will try to use the three days of pomp marking Nato's 75th anniversary to reassure allies over US leadership, and his own ability to govern, as calls grow for him to quit the fight for a second term in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has so far defied pressure from some within his own party to step aside, after a bad debate performance against election rival Donald Trump last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our allies are looking for US leadership," Biden said in an interview on Monday. "Who else do you think could step in here and do this? I expanded Nato. I solidified Nato."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As doubts swirl over Biden, the rest of the 32-nation alliance is nervously eyeing a potential return to the White House by Trump after elections in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the campaign trail the ex-reality TV star has threatened to blow apart the principle of mutual self-defence that has underpinned Nato since it was founded in the wake of the Second World War.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is not just the United States that faces political questions. French President Emmanuel Macron arrives after fending off a push by the country's far-right to win power, new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has his first international outing, and Hungary's premier Viktor Orban flies in after a much-criticised meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said he would discuss with Nato leaders the distinct threat North Korea poses to Europe by deepening military ties with Russia, warning that Moscow must choose between the two Koreas where its true interests lie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It "depends entirely" on Russia where it wants to take future ties with South Korea, Yoon said, adding that Seoul would make a decision on weapons support for Ukraine based on how a new military pact between Moscow and Pyongyang plays out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Military co-operation between Russia and North Korea poses a distinct threat and grave challenge to the peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Europe," Yoon said. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia has attacked cities across Ukraine with a missile barrage that killed more than three dozen people and ripped open a children's hospital in Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of volunteers including hospital staff and rescue workers dug through debris from the Okhmatdyt paediatric hospital in search for survivors after the rare day-time bombardment on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched dozens of missiles toward five towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine as well as the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 37 people were killed, including three children, with more than 170 wounded, Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strikes damaged nearly 100 buildings, including multiple schools and a maternity hospital, he added. The air force said air defence systems downed 30 projectiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is necessary to shoot down Russian missiles. It is necessary to destroy the Russian combat aircraft on its bases. It is necessary to take strong steps that will not leave any security deficit," Zelensky said ahead of a Nato summit where arming Ukraine's air defences is expected to top the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council over the barrage and urged Ukraine's allies to deliver "a stronger response" to Russia's attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the strikes, US President Joe Biden on Monday promised "new measures" to boost Ukraine's air defences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with our allies, we will be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine's air defences to help protect their cities and civilians from Russian strikes," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack spurred a fire at a power substation and at an oil depot in Russia's Volgograd region, the governor of the region in southern Russia said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Air defence and electronic warfare forces suppressed a UAV [unnamed aerial vehicle] attack on the territory of the Volgograd region," Andrei Bocharov, the governor, said in a post published on the Telegram channel of the region's administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of falling UAV debris, fires broke out at a substation in Frolovo and an oil depot in Kalach-on-the-Don." (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing said on Monday it had reached a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, which court papers show would see the aviation giant plead guilty to fraud.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department," Boeing told AFP in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of crash victims immediately filed an objection to the deal, arguing that it "unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine Berthet, who lost her daughter Camille in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in 2019 -- involving a 737 MAX 8 -- said the deal reflects "weakness and manifest contempt for the victims' families and public interest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Court papers filed in Texas on Sunday said the company had agreed to plead guilty to "conspiracy to defraud the United States" during the certification of MAX airplanes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plea deal sees Boeing avoid a criminal trial, instead agreeing to a series of terms including a US$243.6 million fine on top of the same sum already paid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company will also be required to make a minimum investment of US$455 million in "compliance and safety programs".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such changes at the firm will be overseen by an independent monitor appointed by the government for a three-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's board of directors will also be required to meet the families of crash victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-profile agreement follows the DOJ finding in May that Boeing failed to improve its compliance and ethics program, in breach of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in the wake of the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The families of victims will ask the court to reject the plea deal at an upcoming hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises," said the objection filed by their legal team Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement shared by her lawyers, Berthet added that the agreement shows the DOJ's "deafness" despite an alarming rise in incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing flouted its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conclusion opened up the company to possible prosecution, with Boeing initially arguing it did not violate the 2021 accord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DOJ representatives briefed families in late June on the proposed plea deal and the company was given until July 5 to accept the offer, or face trial. (AFP)

    World should help Ukraine, Russia resume talks: Xi

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called on the international community to help Ukraine and Russia resume dialogue in a bid to resolve their conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi and visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis in talks in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban briefed Xi on his recent visits to Ukraine and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president stressed an early ceasefire and a political settlement are in the interests of all parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi called on the international community "to create conditions and provide support for the resumption of direct dialogue and negotiation between the two sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted him as saying that "only if all major countries inject positive rather than negative energy, can a ceasefire in this conflict emerge as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Russia and Ukraine, the end of the war “depends on the decision of three world powers, the United States, the European Union and China,” Orban wrote in a Facebook post showing him shaking hands with Xi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Peace mission 3.0” is how Orban captioned a picture posted on the X social media platform depicting him after having stepped off his plane in Beijing earlier on Monday in this previously unannounced visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the EU at the start of July, and Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Orban had come to Moscow as a top representative of the European Council. Several top European officials dismissed that suggestion and said Orban had no mandate for anything beyond a discussion about bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi visited Hungary in May this year for the final leg of a European tour that also took him to France and Serbia. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of the leftist New Popular Front gather at the Place de la République in Paris to celebrate its strong showing in the polls. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760678_1_20240708123101.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France faced a hung parliament and the prospect of taxing negotiations to form a government, after a surprise left-wing surge blocked Marine Le Pen's quest to bring the far right to power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leftist New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the dominant force in the National Assembly after Sunday's election, but with no single group securing a working majority the possibilities include the NFP forming a minority government or the building of a broad, unwieldy coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result delivered a stinging blow to President Emmanuel Macron and leaves the euro zone's second largest economy in limbo, heralding a period of political instability just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron ended up with a hugely fragmented parliament, in what is set to weaken France's role in the European Union and further afield, and make it hard for anyone to push through a domestic agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left won 182 seats, Macron's centrist alliance 168 and Le Pen's National Rally (RN) and allies 143, interior ministry data cited by Le Monde newspaper showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would tender his resignation, but it was not clear whether the president would accept it immediately, given the daunting task ahead to form a government. Attal said he would be willing to stay on in a caretaker role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will of course do my duties as long as it's needed – it cannot be otherwise on the eve of a date (the Olympics) that is so important for our country," Attal said as it became clear Macron's alliance had endured a humbling setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties from the NFP – made up of the French Communist Party, hard left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialist Party – met overnight for first talks on how to proceed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France Unbowed's firebrand leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said the new prime minister should hail from NFP. However, the bloc has no leader and its parties are strongly divided over who they could select as a suitable premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some prominent centrist figures, including Edouard Philippe, a former prime minister under Macron, said they were ready to work on a pact to ensure a stable government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The euro fell on Sunday after the vote projections were announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France's legislative ability," said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Le Pen's RN, the result was a far cry from weeks during which opinion polls consistently projected it would win comfortably.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left and centrist alliances cooperated after the first round of voting last week by pulling scores of candidates from three-way races to build a unified anti-RN vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first reaction, RN leader Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's protege, called the cooperation between anti-RN forces a "disgraceful alliance" that he said would paralyse France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen, who will likely be the party's candidate for the 2027 presidential election, said however that Sunday's ballot, in which the RN made major gains compared with previous elections, had sown the seeds for the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our victory has been merely delayed," she said. (Reuters)

    June hottest on record: EU climate monitor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last month was the hottest June on record across the globe, the EU's climate monitor said on Monday, capping half a year of wild and destructive weather from floods to heatwaves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Every month since June 2023 has eclipsed its own temperature record in a 13-month streak of unprecedented global heat, the Copernicus Climate Change Service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is more than a statistical oddity and it highlights a large and continuing shift in our climate," said the service director, Carlo Buontempo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if this specific streak of extremes ends at some point, we are bound to see new records being broken as the climate continues to warm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was "inevitable" as long as humanity kept adding heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The global average temperature notched last month broke the previous June record set in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fresh high came at the midway point of a year marked by climate extremes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scorching heat has blanketed swathes of the world from India to Saudi Arabia, the United States and Mexico in the first half of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relentless rain, a phenomena scientists have also linked to a warmer planet, caused extensive flooding in Kenya, China, Brazil, Afghanistan, Russia and France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires have torched land in Greece and Canada and last week, Hurricane Beryl became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane on record as it barrelled across several Caribbean islands. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday he had arrived in Beijing on "Peace mission 3.0" after recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Orban was greeted at the airport by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, according to a photo he posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His arrival in Beijing follows surprise visits to Russia and Ukraine in the past week since Hungary took over the European Union's rotating presidency at the start of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban, the friendliest EU leader towards Moscow, held talks with President Vladimir Putin on Friday about the war in Ukraine during a trip criticised by both Kyiv and the EU, which said it threatened to undermine the bloc's stance on the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit also came days before a Nato summit that will address further military aid for Ukraine against what the Western defence alliance has called Russia's "unprovoked war of aggression".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a short statement, the Foreign Ministry said the Hungarian leader would meet President Xi Jinping on Monday "for in-depth communication on issues of mutual interest".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary, under Orban, has become an important trade and investment partner for China, in contrast with some other EU nations. (AFP/Reuters)

    Pressure mounts for Joe Biden to step aside

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden, 81, has faced growing calls to end his re-election bid after a halting performance in a June 27 presidential debate. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760617_1_20240708014147.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An embattled US President Joe Biden faced escalating pressure on Sunday from fellow Democrats worried about his candidacy, concerns he aimed to ease with campaign stops in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, has faced growing calls to end his reelection bid after a halting performance in a June 27 debate with Republican Donald Trump, 78, raised questions about his ability to do the job for another four years. He has vowed to stay in the race, dismissing calls for him to drop out as "nonsense" in a fundraising email on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the Democratic president attended a Black church service in Philadelphia and was later due to travel to the state capital, Harrisburg, for an event with union members and local Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coming week is crucial, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN's "State of the Union." He encouraged the president to try hold a town hall or news conference to convince voters he is "the old Joe Biden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do think the president needs to do more," Murphy said. "I do think the clock is ticking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democrats also suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris, seen as the likeliest candidate to replace Biden in the November 5 election were he to bow out, could perform well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A much-anticipated Biden interview with ABC News on Friday did little to ease concerns of lawmakers and donors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic US Representative Adam Schiff said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that Biden needs to move swiftly to put concerns to rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think she very well could win overwhelmingly, but before we get into a decision about who else it should be, the president needs to make a decision about whether it's him," Schiff said of Harris, a fellow Californian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a meeting on Sunday with senior House Democrats to discuss the president's candidacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Democratic National Committee (DNC) member from Florida, Alan Clendenin, urged Biden to step aside on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Joe Biden will be remembered by historians as one of the finest presidents in American history, but this election is about the next four years, not the last three and a half," Clendenin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DNC has steadfastly supported Biden since his debate stumbles so any defections would suggest a further deepening of the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Friday's interview, Biden said only the "Lord Almighty" could persuade him to drop out, dismissing the prospect that Democratic leaders could join forces to try to talk him into standing down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pennsylvania is one of the half dozen or so states that can swing Democratic or Republican and are expected to determine the outcome of what has been a tight race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunday's trip - Biden's 10th to Pennsylvania during the 2024 election cycle - is part of a July voter outreach blitz by the Democratic Party that includes a US$50 million media campaign aimed at events such as the Olympics and travel by the president, the first lady, Harris and her husband to every battleground state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign said it aims to have volunteers and staff knock on more than 3 million voters' doors in July and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pressure from Congress is expected to steadily increase in the coming days as lawmakers return to Washington from a holiday recess, and donors mull their willingness to keep funding Biden's campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The political crisis is unfolding as Biden prepares to host dozens of world leaders at a high-stakes Nato summit in Washington and hold a rare solo news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five US lawmakers have called for Biden to end his reelection bid, including Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the first Democratic member of the House of Representatives from a battleground district, with others said poised to join in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Given what I saw and heard from the President during last week’s debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the President himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,” Craig, a top 2024 target of House Republican efforts, posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two letters are circulating among House Democrats calling for Biden to step aside, House Democratic sources have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Senator Mark Warner of Virginia invited fellow senators to a meeting on Monday to discuss Biden's campaign. Biden told reporters he had spoken with 20 congressional Democrats, who urged him to stay on. Biden said he knew of no senators ready to join Warner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senator Bernie Sanders, 82, who has run for the Democratic nomination for president in the past, stood firmly in Biden's camp on Sunday, saying Democrats' focus should be on policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not a beauty contest," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation." (Reuters)

    Pope warns against rise in autocracy, nationalism

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pope Francis attended an event in Trieste on Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760611_1_20240707224520.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis decried the state of democracy and warned against "populists" during a short visit to Trieste in Italy's northeast on Sunday ahead of a 12-day trip to Asia -- the longest of his papacy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Democracy is not in good health in the world today," Francis said during a speech at the city's convention centre to close a national Catholic event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without naming any countries, the pope warned against "ideological temptations and populists" on the day that France holds the second round of a snap parliamentary vote that looks set to see the far-right National Rally (RN) party take the largest share of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ideologies are seductive. Some people compare them to the Pied Piper of Hamelin: they seduce but lead you to deny yourself," he said in reference to the German fairytale.

  "The culture of rejection creates a city where there is no place for the poor, the unborn, the fragile, the sick, children, women, the young," he regretted, urging facilitation of social participation from childhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of last month's European parliament elections, bishops in several countries also warned about the rise of populism and nationalism, with far-right parties already holding the reins to power in Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis also urged people to "move away from polarisations that impoverish" and hit out at "self-referential power".

  After Venice in April and Verona in May, the half-day trip to Trieste, a city of 200,000 inhabitants on the Adriatic Sea that borders Slovenia, marked the third one within Italy this year for the 87-year-old pontiff, who has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.

  Since travelling to the French city of Marseille in September 2023, the Argentine Jesuit has limited himself to domestic travel.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A man enters a polling booth to vote in the second round of France's legislative election at a polling station in Le Touquet.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French voters turned out in number on Sunday for the second round of a historic election that is expected to leave the far right as the biggest force in a deeply divided parliament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At midday, according to interior ministry figures, some 26.63 percent of voters had turned out for the high-stakes poll -- the highest number at that time since 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mood in France is tense, with 30,000 police deployed to head off trouble and voters anxious about a potential electoral earthquake shifting the French political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the village of Rosheim, outside the eastern city of Strasbourg, an "anguished" 72-year-old Antoine Schrameck said he feared France would see "a turning point in the history of the republic".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Tourcoing, near the northeast city of Lille, 66-year-old retiree Laurence Abbad said she feared violence after the results are announced. "There's so much tension, people are going mad," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections three years ahead of time after his forces were trounced in June's European parliament vote, a gamble which seems to have backfired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) came top in the June 30 first round, and is on course to repeat the feat in Sunday's run off races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she may not win the outright majority that would force Macron to appoint Le Pen's lieutenant, the RN party leader Jordan Bardella, 28, as prime minister just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hung parliament with a large eurosceptic, anti-immigration contingent could weaken France's international standing and threaten Western unity in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Union officials, already learning to deal with far-right parties in power in Italy and the Netherlands, are watching France closely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Rome, Pope Francis chose the day of the French vote to warn against "ideological temptations and populists", adding: "Democracy is not in good health in the world today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the country on tenterhooks, last week saw more than 200 tactical-voting pacts between centre and left wing candidates in seats to attempt to prevent the RN winning an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This has been hailed as a return of the anti-far right "Republican Front" first summoned when Le Pen's father Jean-Marie faced Jacques Chirac in the run-off of 2002 presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls now forecast that the RN will fall well short of the 289 seats needed for an outright majority in the 577-seat National Assembly, while still becoming the largest party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an outcome could allow Macron to possibly build a broad coalition against the RN and keep Gabriel Attal as prime minister on a caretaker basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it could also herald a long period of paralysed politics in France, as it prepares to host the Olympics from July 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many in France remain baffled over why Macron called an election that could end with the RN doubling its presence in parliament and his contingent of centrist MPs halving in number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the president, known for his theatrical gestures, appears intent on executing what he calls a "clarification" of French politics, which he hopes will eventually leave three clear camps of far right, centre and hard left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final opinion polls published by two organisations on Friday projected the RN would win between 170 to 210 seats, followed by the New Popular Front (NFP) broad left-wing coalition on 145 to 185 and Macron's centrists on 118 to 150.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Macron's Ensemble alliance is forecast to come third, the more successful NFP is a fragile mix of several warring factions ranging from traditional Socialists to the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) of firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "France is on the cusp of a seismic political shift," said analysts at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), warning that even if Macron controlled the government after the election he would face "legislative gridlocks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would weaken "France's voice on the European and international stage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After voting began on Saturday in France's overseas territories, polls opened in mainland France at 0600 GMT and were due to close by 1800 GMT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Projections -- which usually give a very close idea of the final outcome -- are published shortly afterwards, with the political leaders then reacting rapidly to any frenzy that grips the nation. (AFP)

    Biden remains defiant in TV interview

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden's presidential reelection bid hung in the balance Saturday, after his latest efforts to put a disastrous debate showing behind him failed to silence voices urging him to quit the White House race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murmurs of dissent within his own Democratic Party have -- in the case of five individual House representatives -- morphed into direct calls for him to drop out. And a number of key donors have threatened to cut off funding if Biden insists on staying the course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump," Angie Craig, the latest House Democrat to break ranks, said Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has scheduled a virtual meeting of senior Democrat representatives for Sunday to discuss the best way forward, and Democrat Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the upper chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what had been billed as a make-or-break TV interview on Friday, Biden's strategy was to flatly deny the falling poll numbers and concerns over his mental and physical fitness triggered by his dismal performance against rival Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed a severe cold for the debate debacle and insisted it was just a "bad night" rather than evidence of increasing frailty and cognitive decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the 81-year-old was adamant that he would not be pressured to end his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race," he said. "But the Lord Almighty is not coming down."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for less divine intervention do, however, appear to be strengthening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's campaign team is pushing ahead regardless, with two events planned in Pennsylvania on Sunday and visits to other battleground states later in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a rally in Wisconsin before Friday's interview, Biden had delivered a forceful, energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then came the sit-down with the ABC network that appeared unlikely to soothe the concerns of critics who say that -- away from a teleprompter -- Biden can struggle to communicate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of his answers were tentative, meandering and difficult to follow, even as he sought to deflect questions about his mental acuity and dismissed the notion that his party would consider replacing him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign had another small fire to put out Saturday after it emerged that the White House had provided the questions for interviews the president gave to two Black radio stations on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic strategist David Axelrod suggested in a CNN op-ed that Biden is engaged in "Denial. Delusion. Defiance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stakes are as great as Biden describes. And if he believes it, as I think he does, he will eventually do what duty and love of country requires, and step aside," Axelrod wrote in the piece published Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If he does not, it will be Biden's age, and not Trump's moral and ethical void, that will dominate the rest of this most important campaign and sully the president's historic legacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, meanwhile, sarcastically suggested Biden should "ignore his many critics and move forward, with alacrity and strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He should be sharp, precise and energetic, just like he was in The Debate," the Republican challenger said in a social media post Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, Democrats are largely keeping a lid on any simmering discontent with their leader -- at least in public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with election day just four months away, any move to replace Biden as nominee would need to be made sooner rather than later, and the meetings of top Congressional Democrats in coming days will be scrutinized for any signs of more open rebellion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, for Biden and his campaign team, the strategy seems to be to ride it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His next major test will be a press conference scheduled for Thursday during the NATO leaders' summit in Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When pressed in the ABC interview on why he doesn't take an independent neurological exam, Biden argued that the role of US president meant being subjected to constant mental assessment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a cognitive test every single day," he said. "Not only am I campaigning, I'm running the world." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Saturday prepared for its most consequential legislative election of recent times, with residents of overseas territories opening voting for a poll expected to give the far right its biggest ever presence in parliament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A traditional final day pause was observed on Saturday ahead of Sunday's second round runoff after a frenetic campaign that saw tensions rise across the country and dozens of attacks on candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Underlining France's global footprint that spans the oceans of the world, the first French region to vote was Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a small French archipelago off the coast of Canada where citizens began voting from 1000 GMT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were to be followed on Saturday by residents of French Caribbean territories including Martinique and Guadeloupe as well as Guiana in South America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Pacific territories come next before people in mainland France cast their ballots from 0600 GMT on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls will close by 1800 GMT on Sunday when projections of seat numbers -- regarded in France as a firm indicator of the final outcome -- are published.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Final opinion polls on Friday suggested that far-right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) would fall short of winning an outright majority in the National Assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Emmanuel Macron's gamble in calling snap elections is expected to end with his centrist alliance having half the number of deputies it had before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now faces the final three years of his presidency with no clear ruling majority, and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal perhaps trying to hold together a caretaker government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen insists that she is still on course for victory and an absolute majority that would force Macron to appoint her 28-year-old lieutenant Jordan Bardella as prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attal vowed to stay on "as long as necessary" in a caretaker role, while Macron's office is studying options to maintain some form of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron is to remain in office until presidential and legislative elections in April 2027, but he must now face the possibility of sharing power with political foes. (AFP)

    New UK PM Starmer 'restless for change' after win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly elected UK prime minister Keir Starmer on Saturday began his first full day in charge declaring himself "restless for change" and pledging that growth would be his Labour government's "number one mission".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Starmer also confirmed his previously declared intention to end the outgoing Conservative government's flagship scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started... I'm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don't act as a deterrent," he told reporters following his first cabinet meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party on Friday won a landslide election victory, bringing to a close 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour leader told his top team, including Britain's first woman finance minister Rachel Reeves and new foreign minister David Lammy, it had been "the honour and the privilege of my life" to be invited by King Charles III to form the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a huge amount of work to do, so now we get on with our work," he said to applause and smiles around the cabinet table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer spent his first hours in Downing Street on Friday appointing his ministerial team, hours after securing his centre-left party's return to power with a whopping 174-seat majority in the UK parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notable lower-ranking appointments included Patrick Vallance, chief scientific government adviser during the Covid-19 pandemic, who has been made a science minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James Timpson, whose shoe repair company employs ex-offenders, was also made a prisons minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both would be given seats in the upper house of parliament in order to join the government as neither is an elected lawmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said both new ministers were people "associated with change" and illustrated his determination to deliver concrete improvements to people's lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm restless for change, and I think and hope that what you've already seen demonstrates that," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flag-waving crowds of cheering Labour activists on Friday had welcomed Starmer to Downing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But daunting challenges await his government, including a stagnating economy, creaking public services and households suffering from a years-long cost-of-living crisis. (AFP)

    Reformer wins presidential runoff in Iran

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An electoral official said the voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760513_1_20240706155606.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, the interior ministry said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes and Jalili more than 13 million out of about 30 million votes cast, electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said, adding that voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of spoiled ballots was reported to be over 600,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian said the vote was the start of a "partnership" with the Iranian people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy, and trust. I extend my hand to you," Pezeshkian said in a post on social media platform X, after on Tuesday saying he would "extend the hand of friendship to everyone" if he won.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, followed a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority, had called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act "against the system".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ballot comes against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme, and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist allowed to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with around 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for "constructive relations" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to "get Iran out of its isolation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalili, 58, is Iran's former nuclear negotiator who is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters and received backing from other conservative figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Friday's runoff, Pezeshkian and Jalili took part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian vowed to ease long-standing internet restrictions and to "fully" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping congratulated reformist Masoud Pezeshkian for his win in Iran's presidential runoff election, state media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I attach great importance to the development of China-Iran relations and am willing to work with the President to lead the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership towards deeper advancement," state news agency Xinhua reported Xi as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries "have a long history of friendly exchanges, and bilateral relations have maintained healthy and stable development... for over half a century," Xi said, according to Xinhua.(AFP)

 California firefighters battled multiple blazes in record heat on Friday, with a new fire breaking out near the famous Yosemite National Park even as a larger inferno further north came under control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Temperatures up to 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius) were recorded in the western US state on Friday, as the region's latest heat wave nears its peak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Dangerous heat is likely to become more widespread in the West today and Saturday... Temperatures will be 15-30 degrees above average for much of the West Coast today," warned the National Weather Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or broken," the NWS said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The excessive heat comes on the July 4 weekend, when millions of Americans celebrate the anniversary of their nation's independence with displays of fireworks that can spark blazes in hot, dry conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fast-moving fire erupted just outside Yosemite National Park late on Thursday, causing large parts of the former Gold Rush town of Mariposa to be evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Friday afternoon, the fire had burnt nearly 405 hectares and was 15 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winds have calmed which has helped firefighters make progress overnight," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some residents had been allowed to return to their homes. The fire's cause was not yet known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was also progress in northern California, where earlier this week thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Thompson Fire near Oroville.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some of the region's highest temperatures, firefighters reported success in containing the blaze, with some evacuation orders lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, fire officials and forecasters warned that the danger is far from over, with high temperatures expected to spread further and to peak Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week," warned the NWS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate scientists say the western US is undergoing a decades-long aridification as weather patterns change, at least in part because of human-caused global warming. (AFP)

    'I was sick. I was feeling terrible' - Biden

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Campaign officials have resisted suggestions that President Biden may withdraw from the presidential race. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760477_1_20240706090231.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden vowed on Friday to stay in the White House race and blamed his dismal debate performance on "feeling terrible" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign with a make-or-break TV interview.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As rebellion brews among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old's long career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong," the president said in an excerpt of his first TV interview since the debate with Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden sounded raspy and gave meandering answers in the clip, which appeared unlikely to reassure Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trump campaign offered a lightning-quick mocking reaction, posting on X that "Biden sounds great!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sit-down -- which was due to be aired in full later Friday, came after Biden's debate in Atlanta triggered panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As supporters cheered, he went on the attack against his rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's focus on what really matters," Biden said, reading from tele-prompters. "We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least three Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have several major newspapers and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wealthy Disney heiress and Democratic supporter Abigail Disney, told CNBC she plans to withhold donations to the party until Biden drops out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose (in November)", she said. "This is realism, not disrespect," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senate Intelligence Committee chariman Mark Warner has approached fellow Democrats to organize talks on Monday on Biden's path forward, multiple US media outlets reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was convening his own meeting -- a video call with senior Democrats -- on Sunday, according to NBC News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" he do more major interviews to prove himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has announced he will hold a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next Thursday, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the Nato meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the American Southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With speculation swirling over a potential switch in the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 59-year-old former prosecutor has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading alternative if he steps aside. (AFP)

    Deadline looms for beleaguered Boeing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are assembled at the company’s plant in Renton, Washington. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760474_1_20240706084446.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than five years after two fatal 737 MAX crashes, Boeing faces a fresh legal reckoning now that prosecutors have concluded the company flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The aviation giant had been on a Friday night deadline to accept or reject a Department of Justice proposal that would require it to plead guilty to fraud during the certification of MAX airplanes, sources told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been no public comment either way by the evening, and a lawyer for the families of the 737 crash victims, Robert Clifford, told AFP that he believed the deadline would be extended over the weekend if Boeing asked for more time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest legal predicament was triggered by a DOJ determination in mid-May that the company ignored a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) by not meeting requirements to improve its compliance and ethics program after the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under a proposal presented by the DOJ to families of MAX crash victims, Boeing would pay an additional US$243 million penalty and agree to have an external monitor, said Tracy Brammeier, an attorney at Clifford Law who represents families of MAX victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The guilty plea is significant. No one wants to be a convicted or admitted felon," said Brammeier, who nonetheless described family members as dissatisfied with the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a US court on how it will proceed no later than July 7, with the agency expected to announce steps to prosecute Boeing should the company reject the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing, which has previously said it honoured the terms of the DPA, declined comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021 near the end of the Trump administration over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification of the MAX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year. But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing breached its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of victims, who have pressed for a criminal trial of Boeing and its top executives, remain unhappy that the new plea agreement does not explicitly link Boeing's fraud to the 346 fatalities from crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, according to Brammeier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The families want accountability and still are not getting it," Brammeier said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash, said the DOJ should also impose much stiffer fines on Boeing -- from US$10 billion to US$20 billion -- with the caveat that they could be suspended if the company invests in safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's too good a deal for Boeing," said Stumo, who added that Boeing should not have a say in who is appointed its independent monitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, said the DOJ's decision to stick with the original charge -- rather than supplement it -- reflects a desire to "bring the claims that could be most easily proven if it goes to trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said DPAs like Boeing's often "poorly serve" the public interest because "prosecutors probably care much more about achieving a conviction than ensuring the defendant is adequately deterred and restrained," he wrote in a blog post this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coffee suggested the DOJ should consider measures such as barring CEO compensation models that encourage risk-taking, or ensuring that funds clawed back from executives who plead guilty of wrongdoing go to whistleblowers as a way "to shift some of the cost of deterrence from shareholders to senior management." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday said positions in the Ukraine war were "far apart" and "many" steps would be needed to end the conflict after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have found that positions are far apart. The number of steps needed to end the war and bring about peace are many," the Hungarian leader told a press conference alongside Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in terms of dialogue and restoring dialogue, the first important step has been taken today and I will continue this work," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin told Orban that Ukraine must abandon four regions in the east and south that Moscow claims as its own if Kyiv wants peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about the full withdrawal of all troops from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and from the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions," Putin said in televised remarks after what he called a "frank and useful" conversation with Orban in Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban informed Nato ahead of his visit to Moscow, alliance head Jens Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, Viktor Orban is not representing Nato at these meetings. He's representing his own country," Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hungary agrees that Russia is responsible for the war. Russia is the perpetrator, and Russia can end this war today by stopping attacking Ukraine," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban unsettled the European Union and Nato allies by flying to Moscow to sit down for talks with Putin, with whom he has long fostered friendly relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said he viewed Orban as a representative for Europe, despite EU leaders emphasising that Orban was acting on his own initiative in an exclusively bilateral role with no mandate to speak for the bloc. (AFP)

    Starmer pledges to rebuild UK after election win

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Keir Starmer speaks at a reception in London to celebrate the Labour victory. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760411_1_20240705174724.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer vowed to rebuild Britain as its next prime minister after his Labour Party on Friday surged to a landslide victory in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of Conservative government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour won a massive majority in the 650-seat parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rishi Sunak's Conservatives suffered the worst performance in the party's long history as voters punished them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services and a series of scandals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did it," Starmer said in a victory speech. "Change begins now... We said we would end the chaos, and we will, we said we would turn the page, and we have. Today, we start the next chapter, begin the work of change, the mission of national renewal and start to rebuild our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election result has upended British politics. Labour won some 410 seats, an increase of 210, while the Conservatives, the western world's most successful party, lost about 250 lawmakers, including a record number of senior ministers and former Prime Minister Liz Truss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scottish National Party imploded, losing 38 seats, ending its own decade of dominance in Scotland and leaving its dream of independence for Scotland in tatters, while conversely the Irish nationalists Sinn Fein became Northern Ireland's largest party for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the populist right-wing Reform UK party, headed by Nigel Farage, the Brexit campaigner and friend of Donald Trump, won more than four million votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While it secured only four lawmakers, its impact on the outcome by siphoning vast tracts of Conservative support will make Farage a major thorn in the side of the two major parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A glum Sunak conceded defeat and will meet King Charles later to formally resign before Starmer is appointed in his place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides," Sunak said. "There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates... I am sorry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his convincing victory, polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party. Thanks to the quirk of Britain's first past the post system and a low turnout, Labour's triumph was achieved with fewer votes than it secured in 2017 and 2019, the latter its worst result for 84 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pound and British stocks and government bonds rose on Friday, but Starmer comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, have already been scaled back while Starmer has promised not to raise taxes for "working people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Likewise, he has promised to scrap the Conservative's controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but with migration a key electoral issue, he will be under pressure himself to find a way to stop tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel from France on small boats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't promise you it will be easy," Starmer said. "Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. It's hard work. Patient, determined, work, and we will have to get moving immediately." (Reuters)
