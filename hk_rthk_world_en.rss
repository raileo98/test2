<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched raids on Wednesday across the occupied West Bank, where its forces killed at least nine Palestinians and sealed off the volatile city of Jenin, according to Palestinian officials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jewish state has carried out near-daily raids across the West Bank since Hamas' October 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the ongoing war there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militant groups said they were exchanging fire with the Israeli military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governor of Jenin, Kamal Abu al-Rub, said on Palestinian radio that Israeli forces had surrounded the city, blocking exit and entry points and access to hospitals, and ripping up infrastructure in the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank said Israeli forces had blocked the roads leading to a hospital with dirt barriers and surrounded other medical facilities in Jenin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military confirmed it was operating in the cities of Jenin and Tulkarem but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz drew comparisons with Gaza and called for similar measures in the West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must deal with the threat just as we deal with the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza, including the temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and whatever steps might be required. This is a war in every respect, and we must win it," he wrote on the platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank to rise up, saying the raids are part of a larger plan to expand the war in Gaza and blaming the escalation on US support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 652 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed by Israeli fire since the war in Gaza began over 10 months ago, according to the Palestinian ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most have died during such raids, which often trigger gun battles with militants. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan issued an emergency warning on Wednesday as powerful Typhoon Shanshan approached the southwestern region with heavy rain and strong winds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Airlines and rail operators cancelled some services over the coming days as the typhoon, categorised as "very strong", packed strong winds and gusts of up to 252 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Maximum caution is required given that forecasts are for strong winds, high waves and high tides that have not been seen thus far," the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanshan is expected to strike the southwestern Kyushu island over the next few days and approach the central and eastern regions, which includes the capital Tokyo, around the weekend, JMA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities issued evacuation orders for more than 800,000 residents in Kagoshima prefecture in Kyushu and the central Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two people were missing after a landslide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A wall of mud, rocks and other debris on Tuesday swept away a house in Gamagori, a city in central Aichi prefecture. Three others had been pulled out, according to public broadcaster NHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The typhoon also prompted Toyota Motor to suspend operations at all of its domestic factories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 28 production lines at 14 group companies will suspend operations from Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Typhoon Shanshan is the latest storm to hit Japan following last week's Typhoon Ampil, which also led to blackouts and evacuations. (Reuters/AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police fire tear gas shells during a clash between police, citizens, and students in Kolkata, India. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767995_1_20240828161624.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of protesters clashed in India's eastern city of Kolkata on Wednesday as demonstrations seeking justice for a murdered doctor spiralled into violent street skirmishes between political rivals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's body at a state-run hospital in Kolkata on August 9 stoked nationwide anger over the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sparked strikes by medics and rallies backed by thousands of ordinary citizens across India, although many doctors have since returned to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But repeated protests in West Bengal state capital Kolkata have transformed into clashes between the state's ruling All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hindu-nationalist BJP is the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and holds power nationally, but sits in opposition in West Bengal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want justice", BJP supporters chanted, referring to the murdered doctor, then demanding the resignation of AITMC leader Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Go back! Go back!" AITMC supporters shouted in return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, police clashed with protesters, firing tear gas canisters and water cannons, and arresting at least 245 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That prompted BJP supporters on Wednesday to launch a day-long shutdown of Kolkata, with skirmishes against AITMC supporters in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters erected barricades to close roads and railway lines, with police reporting clashes between rival workers across the city and in adjoining districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man has been detained for the murder, but Banerjee's government has faced public criticism for the handling of the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's Supreme Court has ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the "horrific" killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation". (AFP)

    Trump faces revised indictment in 2020 election case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Special counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment against Donald Trump over his alleged efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767987_1_20240828152343.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump faced a revised federal indictment on Tuesday accusing him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, with prosecutors narrowing their approach after a US Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US Special Counsel Jack Smith's team obtained the superseding indictment in the Washington case, though it was highly unlikely to proceed to trial ahead of the November 5 election when Trump faces his Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised indictment lays out the same four charges prosecutors brought against the former president last year, but this one focuses on Trump's role as a political candidate seeking re-election, rather than as the president at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that Trump is at least presumptively immune from criminal prosecution for actions that were within his constitutional powers as president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington was expected to decide in coming weeks which aspects of the case must be tossed out based on the Supreme Court's immunity decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump in a statement on his Truth Social media platform said the Supreme Court's immunity ruling should lead to the entire case being thrown out, saying, "Smith rewrote the exact same case in an effort to circumvent the Supreme Court Decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, denouncing this case and the others he faces as politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls have shown Harris opening up a narrow national lead over Trump since President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This indictment, like the initial one, accuses Trump of a multi-part conspiracy to block the certification of his election defeat to Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It retains allegations Trump pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to use his role presiding over the congressional certification of the election on January 6, 2021, to reject electoral votes from battleground states Trump lost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on that January 6 in an attempt to halt the congressional certification, which remains part of the case against Trump. (Reuters)

    SpaceX mission to feature first private spacewalk

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767918_1_20240828062642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX is poised for another attempt at launching a daring orbital expedition featuring an all-civilian crew that is aiming to carry out the first-ever spacewalk by private citizens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Polaris Dawn mission, organised by billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman is now set to lift off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida during a four-hour window beginning on Wednesday at 3:38 am local time (0738 GMT), with backup opportunities available on Thursday if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather conditions appeared 85 percent favourable, according to a US Space Force forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier launch attempt on Tuesday was scrapped due to a helium leak on a line connecting the tower to the rocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket, the SpaceX Dragon capsule is set to reach a peak altitude of 1,400 kilometres – higher than any crewed mission in more than half a century, since the Apollo era.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mission commander Isaacman will guide his four-member team through the mission's centrepiece: the first-ever spacewalk carried out by non-professional astronauts, equipped with sleek, newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity (EVA) suits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rounding out the team are mission pilot Scott Poteet, a retired US Air Force Lieutenant Colonel; mission specialist Sarah Gillis, a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX; and mission specialist and medical officer Anna Menon, also a lead space operations engineer at SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quartet underwent more than two years of training in preparation for the landmark mission, logging hundreds of hours on simulators as well as skydiving, centrifuge training, scuba diving, and summiting an Ecuadorian volcano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polaris Dawn is set to be the first of three missions under the Polaris programme, a collaboration between Isaacman, the founder of tech company Shift4 Payments, and SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Isaacman declined to reveal his total investment in the project, though reports suggest he paid around US$200 million for the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission in September 2021, the first all-civilian orbital mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day, venturing briefly into the Van Allen radiation belt, a region teeming with high-energy charged particles that can pose health risks to humans over extended periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On day three, the crew will don their state-of-the-art EVA spacesuits – outfitted with heads-up displays, helmet cameras, and advanced joint mobility systems – and take turns to venture outside their spacecraft in twos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each will spend 15 to 20 minutes in space, 700 kilometres above Earth's surface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on their to-do list are testing laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and Starlink, SpaceX's more than 6,000-strong constellation of internet satellites, in a bid to boost space communication speeds, and conducting nearly 40 scientific experiments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include tests with contact lenses embedded with microelectronics to continuously monitor changes in eye pressure and shape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After six days in space, the mission will conclude with a splashdown off the coast of Florida. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The protests over the gruesome rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata continue. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767902_1_20240828013657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in India fired tear gas and water cannon on Tuesday as they clashed with thousands of protesters seeking justice for a doctor who was raped and murdered in Kolkata this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a state-run hospital in the eastern city stoked nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's demonstration saw thousands march to a government building in Kolkata to demand the resignation of Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They shouted slogans and clashed with police, who charged the crowd with batons in an effort to disperse it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Namita Ghosh, a college student who attended the protest, said that the crowd had intended to "protest peacefully" before the baton charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 100 protesters "have been arrested on the charge of creating violence," a senior police official said on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous protests in Kolkata prompted by the crime have transformed into unruly political rallies, with police scuffling with demonstrators from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) angry at the state government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hindu-nationalist BJP is the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but it is an opposition party in West Bengal, of which Kolkata is the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have accused Banerjee's government of creating an unsafe environment for women that allowed crimes including the doctor's murder to occur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman's body was found in the teaching hospital's seminar hall, suggesting she had gone there for a break during a 36-hour shift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doctors' associations in many cities launched strikes over the murder that cut off non-essential services, though medical professionals have since returned to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man has been detained over the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gruesome nature of the attack has invoked comparisons with the horrific 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That incident sparked widespread outrage in a country where sexual violence against women is endemic, with an average of nearly 90 rapes a day were reported in 2022 in the country of 1.4 billion people. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='General Director of the IAEA Rafael Grossi says he was in "close contact" with Russian authorities and would visit Kyiv next week. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767893_1_20240827225153.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UN nuclear watchdog head Rafael Grossi on Tuesday warned during a visit to Russia's Kursk nuclear plant that its proximity to ongoing fighting was "extremely serious" following Ukraine's unprecedented cross-border offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Grossi said his tour enabled him to "look at the most important parts" of the plant, which is less than 50 kilometres from fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A nuclear power plant of this type so close to a point of contact or military front is an extremely serious fact," Grossi said after visiting the plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact we have military activity a few kilometres, a few miles away from here, make it an immediate point of attention," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the end of the day, again, this may sound common sense and simple: Don't attack a nuclear power plant."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he was in "close contact" with Russian authorities and would visit Kyiv next week to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, adding it was "important to talk" and "keep dialogue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Kursk power plant currently was "operating in a very close to normal conditions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly warned of the dangers of fighting around nuclear plants following Russia's full-scale military offensive into Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first days of the conflict, Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, and also briefly held the decommissioned Chernobyl plant in the north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine launched its surprise incursion into Kursk on August 6 and has said it is making advances, even as Russian forces move deeper into eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused Ukraine of trying to attack the Kursk nuclear power plant, with drone fragments found near its spent nuclear fuel storage facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was informed about the impact of drones, I was shown some of the remnants of those, signs of impact they had," Grossi said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant lies some 60 kilometres from the Russia-Ukraine border, next to the Seym river, and less than 50 kilometres away from Kursk city, the region's capital with a population of around 440,000. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said it rescued an Israeli hostage in Gaza on Tuesday after a "complex operation", as the Israel-Hamas war, now in its 11th month, showed no signs of abating.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kaid Alkadi, a 52-year-old Israeli Bedouin, was abducted by Palestinian militants during the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kaid Alkadi was rescued... in a complex operation in the southern Gaza Strip," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is in a stable medical condition and is being transferred for medical checks to a hospital."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alkadi is a resident of Rahat, a mainly Arab town, and on October 7 he had been working as a guard at a warehouse in southern Israel when he was seized by militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to seizing every opportunity to bring the hostages back to their homes," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the rescue of Alkadi was "miraculous".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, we must remember that military operations alone cannot free the remaining hostages who have suffered 326 days of abuse and terror," it said, insisting only a ceasefire could ensure the return of other captives", it said adding that "a negotiated deal is the only way forward".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On October 7, militants attacked southern Israeli communities in an unprecedented attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, mostly civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 104 of whom are still captive in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign since then has killed at least 40,476 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory. Most of the dead are women and children, according to UN rights office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the United Nations said humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip has taken a serious blow after Israel ordered a new evacuation in the centre of the besieged territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday the Israeli military ordered people to "evacuate immediately" a part of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, sparking a rapid exodus of civilians and displacing UN and NGO workers. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Fans of Oasis buzzed with anticipation as the band announced its reunion 15 years after its last performance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Oasis will reunite for a tour, the Britpop band known for their timeless hits like “Wonderwall” and “Don't Look Back in Anger” announced Tuesday, ending a 15-year hiatus and, presumably, the long-held feud between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The guitar band said tickets for the 14-date tour will go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday. The tour will begin July 4-5, 2025 in Cardiff, Wales, before moving on to four dates in Manchester, four at London's Wembley stadium, two in Edinburgh and two in Dublin where the tour will conclude on Aug. 17, the band said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is it. This is happening,″ the band said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oasis split in 2009 after many years of infighting, with Noel Gallagher officially leaving the band just before a performance at a festival near Paris. Even before the dissolution, the brothers had long had an antagonistic relationship and reportedly did not speak to each other for years after the breakup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer,” Noel Gallagher, the band's guitarist and songwriter, wrote in a statement at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the Gallagher brothers haven’t performed together since, both regularly perform Oasis songs at their solo gigs. They've also each fired off criticisms of the other in the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noel Gallagher accused his younger brother of having a hangover that forced them to cancel a 2009 concert. The frontman disputed the accusation and sued, later dropping the lawsuit. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Tuesday arrived in Beijing where he will hold talks with senior officials including Foreign Minister Wang Yi in a three-day visit aimed at easing tensions between the two countries ahead of the November presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sullivan's plane landed just before 2pm and was greeted at the airport by US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sullivan wants to expand military-to-military talks between the China and the US down to the theatre command level, a move Washington hopes could help manage tensions in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US also wants China to take more action at home to prevent the development of chemicals that can be made into fentanyl, the leading cause of American drug overdoses, and reach an understanding about safety standards for artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing plans to express its disapproval over US tariffs on a range of manufactured goods and export controls targeting Chinese chip makers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US has continuously taken unreasonable measures against China in terms of tariffs, export controls, investment reviews and unilateral sanctions, which have seriously undermined China's legitimate rights and interests," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency said Sullivan's visit will mark the start of a new round of strategic communication between the two sides. "This visit is another opportunity for both nations to stabilise their bilateral relationship and seek common ground amid rising global uncertainties," Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Sullivan's first visit to China and the first by a US national security advisor to the country in eight years. (Agencies)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767830_1_20240827145801.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was charged on Tuesday with sedition over a speech he made that allegedly questioned the integrity of the country's previous king.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin, who led Malaysia from March 2020 until August 2021, pleaded not guilty in a court in northeast Kelantan state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the charge sheet, Muhyiddin made the seditious remarks last month during a by-election campaign in Kelantan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine ethnic Malay state rulers take turns as Malaysia’s king for five-year terms under the country’s rotating monarchy, which began when Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monarchy plays a largely ceremonial role, but are revered by the nation's majority Muslims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his speech on August 14, Muhyiddin had questioned why then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah didn't invite him to be prime minister following a hung Parliament in November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin had claimed he had the backing of majority lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin's Islamic nationalistic bloc received stronger-than-expected support from Malays, who account for two-thirds of Malaysia’s 34 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sultan Abdullah appointed then-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim as prime minister after Anwar cobbled up support from rival parties to form a unity government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sultan Abdullah from central Pahang state, who ended his reign in January this year, didn't comment on the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his son issued a strong rebuke to Muhyiddin, saying his remarks were dangerous and could divide the people and undermine the royal institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muhyiddin was questioned by police following complaints against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied insulting the royalty, saying his remarks were factual and that he had handed in a sworn oath of support by 115 lawmakers in the 222-member parliament. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian authorities issued new air raid alerts across the country on Tuesday as Russian bombers took to the skies, a day after Moscow carried out a "massive" attack on Ukraine's power grid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia fired hundreds of drones and missiles at Ukraine on Monday, killing at least four people and battering the country's already weakened energy grid, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian attack triggered widespread blackouts and came after Kyiv claimed new advances in its incursion in Russia's Kursk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's air force confirmed early Tuesday the "takeoff of several Tu-95MS from the Engels airfield" in western Russia, prompting air raid alerts across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three more people were killed in overnight Russian attacks, according to local officials, two in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rig and one in southeastern Zaporizhzhia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched at least 127 missiles and 109 drones in "one of the largest Russian attacks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of those, 102 missiles and 99 drones were shot down, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk, who described it as Russia's "most massive" attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and Britain both condemned the assault, with US President Joe Biden calling it "outrageous" and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy branding it "cowardly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany's foreign ministry said that "once again, Putin's Russia is saturating Ukraine's lifelines with missiles". (AFP)

    UN says movement of aid, aid workers in Gaza halted

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Israeli military has told people in Deir al-Balah to evacuate immediately. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767753_1_20240827033817.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations said on Monday it had to halt the movement of aid and aid workers within Gaza due to a new Israeli evacuation order for the Deir al-Balah area, which had become a hub for its workers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A senior UN official had earlier said that UN operations had stopped completely within the Strip, but officials later clarified that operations "in situ" and "embedded" with local populations would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the official, the UN had relocated most of its personnel in operations to Deir al-Balah following a Rafah evacuation order several months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said on Monday it was targeting "terror operatives" in Deir al-Balah and working to dismantle the remaining "infrastructure" of Hamas, whose October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has told people to evacuate immediately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the UN humanitarian agency (Ocha), 15 premises hosting UN and NGO aid workers and four UN warehouses were affected, being either in or near the area ordered to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After it appeared that the UN had shut down its Gaza operations, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, clarified that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees was continuing operations, although under restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What our senior UN official was referring to is UN officials and UN humanitarian staff moving about," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If humanitarian workers are embedded with a certain population in a certain area, they have the tools to operate and to share and to distribute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They will do so," he added, though warning that it would be "half a drop in a barrel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sam Rose, senior deputy field director for Unrwa in Gaza, added that "health services continue across eight or nine primary healthcare centres and over 90 health points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But indeed, the space and the ability of the UN system, of the humanitarian system to operate in Gaza is becoming increasingly difficult," Rose added. (AFP)

    Paris metro 'impossible' for disabled, admits boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Paris metro comprises more than 300 stations, but only 29 stops are wheelchair-accessible. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767747_1_20240827012015.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Paris regional transport network admitted on Monday that the city's metro system is near-impossible for disabled people to navigate as the French capital prepares to host the Paralympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Games start on Wednesday, with a lack of accessible metro transport for disabled visitors a major gripe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first Paris metro opened in 1900 and the network has grown into the busiest system in the European Union, with more than 300 stations spread over 16 lines carrying over four million passengers daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But only 29 stops are wheelchair-accessible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city's historic metro lines "remain the weak spot" in terms of accessibility, said Valerie Pecresse, who as president of the Paris region also runs its transport network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called for a massive effort to fix the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While all buses running in central Paris can take wheelchairs, only 25 percent of rail services – metros, trams and the RER suburban mass transit system – were accessible, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the metro could be modernised in terms of accessibility, she told reporters, although it would take 20 years and cost between 15 and 20 billion euros (US$16.7 to 22.3 billion) in investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an effort "could become the great project of this decade", she said, dubbing the idea "A Metro for All."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris's preparations for the Paralympics, which run to September 8, has highlighted the lack of accessible transportation in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Pecresse said some solutions had been put in place for the Games, including around 100 minibuses to take disabled visitors to competition venues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There would also be a smartphone app to help them prepare their journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities expect up to 300,000 daily visitors during the Paralympics, about half that of the Olympics. (AFP)

    Israel strikes Gaza after Lebanon flare-up

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military struck the Gaza Strip on Monday a day after truce talks in Cairo coincided with a major but brief cross-border escalation involving Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, has drawn in Tehran-aligned armed groups across the Middle East, repeatedly heightening fears of a broader regional conflagration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the latest flare-up between Israel and Hamas-ally Hezbollah, the Lebanese group on Sunday launched rockets and drones in retaliation for a top commander's killing as Israel carried out air raids the military said thwarted a larger attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel swiftly revoked a state of emergency declared early on Sunday, and Hezbollah said its operation was "completed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intense diplomacy has sought to head off a broader retaliation for the late July killings of senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike on Beirut, and of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators held meetings in the Egyptian capital on Sunday but reported no breakthrough in months of protracted negotiations to end the Gaza war as the fighting raged on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key sticking point has been Israel's insistence that it keep control of several strategic areas, including the so-called Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, to stop Hamas from re-arming, something the militant group has refused to countenance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cairo, which has been mediating the talks alongside Qatar and the United States, made clear on Monday it would not support continued Israeli control of the corridor, according to state-linked media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt "reiterated to all parties that it will not accept any Israeli presence" along the corridor, Al-Qahera news reported, citing a high-level source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the ground, witnesses reported air strikes and shelling in Gaza City and other parts of the besieged Palestinian territory overnight and Israel's military said it had struck militants in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medics said an air strike on a Gaza City house killed at least five people, with two rescuers saying more victims may be buried in the ruins in Al-Rimal neighbourhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still martyrs and body parts under the rubble," ambulance driver Hussein Muhaysen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli military statement said troops had "eliminated" dozens of militants over the past day in the southern areas of Khan Younis and Rafah, and near Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,199 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40,435 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not break down civilian and militant deaths. The UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants in their attack, 105 remain in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces throughout the war, in what the group says is support for its Palestinian ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After weeks of retaliation threats, Hezbollah early on Sunday launched what it said was part of its response to Shukr's killing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking hours after Hezbollah announced its attacks on Israel with hundreds of rockets and drones, the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah said the "main target" was an intelligence base outside Tel Aviv, more than 100 kilometres from the Lebanese border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said there were "no hits" on the Glilot intelligence complex, which according to Israeli media is home to the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli air strikes at the same time hit more than 270 targets in Lebanon, "90 percent" of which were rockets "aimed at northern Israel," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet the strikes were "not the final word" in the campaign against Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasrallah appeared to suggest Hezbollah's retaliation for Shukr's killing might be over, saying "if the result is satisfactory" then its response "has been accomplished."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Foreign Minister Nasser Kanani praised the Hezbollah attack, saying the "strategic balance has undergone fundamental changes" to the detriment of Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas official said that a delegation from the group met mediators in Egypt's capital on Sunday. Israeli negotiators were also scheduled to go to Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks have been based on a framework laid out in late May by US President Joe Biden and a "bridging proposal" Washington put forth earlier this month with support from Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 10 months of war have left large parts of Gaza in ruins, ravaged its healthcare system and sparked a dire humanitarian crisis and warnings of famine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A batch of polio vaccines entered Gaza on Sunday, Israeli authorities said. UN agencies have planned a mass inoculation drive after the first case there in 25 years was confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successive Israeli evacuation orders have forced many Gazans, most of whom have already been displaced at least once by the war, to move again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters on Sunday from her hospital bed outside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, Tamam al-Raei said she did not know where to seek safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a war injury. I have broken bones and have had an amputation, and I have been receiving treatment for that," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now they're telling us to evacuate Al-Aqsa. Where do we go? Where do I get treatment?" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said its military was carrying out armed patrols near the Myanmar border this week, with Beijing concerned about the potential fallout from a civil war on the other side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Troops were deployed to Yunnan Province on Monday to test their ability to maintain security in border areas, the military’s Southern Theatre Command said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An alliance of ethnic militias has dealt a series of setbacks to Myanmar's military in the country's northeast, which is near China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five people were injured on the Chinese side in January by a stray artillery shell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live-fire drills would be held from Tuesday to Thursday in four locations including two in Ruili city, the Yunnan government said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The units will carry out armed patrols and joint air-ground patrols to test their ability to mobilise quickly, block and control and strike together, the southern command said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military previously held live-fire drills near the Myanmar border in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi said earlier this month that China “opposes chaos and war in Myanmar," according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing helped broker a cease-fire in Myanmar back in January, but that fell apart in June when one member of the Three Brotherhood Alliance launched new attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar issued a reminder this month to citizens in Shan State to strengthen their security precautions and stay away from conflict zones or return to China. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistani officials on Monday said at least 23 people were killed in a militant attack on a highway in southwestern Pakistan which targeted vehicles from buses to goods trucks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Armed men blocked the route in the province of Balochistan on Sunday night, took passengers off the vehicles, and shot them after checking their identity cards, a senior superintendent of police, Ayub Achakzai, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The armed men also not only killed passengers but also killed the drivers of trucks carrying coal," said Hameed Zahir, the deputy commissioner of the area where the incident occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 trucks were set on fire after their drivers had been killed, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants fighting a decades-old ethnic insurgency to demand the secession of resource-rich Balochistan from Pakistan have targeted workers from the eastern province of Punjab whom they see as exploiting their resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Balochistan Liberation Army group said its fighters had targeted military personnel travelling in civilian clothes, who were shot after being identified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's interior ministry said the dead were innocent citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack in a statement, vowing that security forces would retaliate and bring those responsible to justice. (Reuters)

    Australia gives workers the right to disconnect

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People can now "refuse to monitor, read, or respond to" their employers' attempts to contact them outside work hours. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767630_1_20240826094025.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia gave millions of workers the legal right to "disconnect" on Monday, allowing them to ignore unreasonable out-of-hours contact from employers, to the distress of big industry.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People can now "refuse to monitor, read, or respond to" their employers' attempts to contact them outside work hours -- unless that refusal is deemed "unreasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law is similar to legislation in some European and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unions welcomed the legislation, saying it gave workers a way to reclaim a level of work-life balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a historic day for working people," said Michele O'Neil, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The union movement has won the legal right for Australians to spend quality time with their loved ones without the stress of being forced to constantly answer unreasonable work calls and emails," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australian unions have reclaimed the right to knock off after work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the reforms got a cool welcome from Australian industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'right to disconnect' laws are rushed, poorly thought out and deeply confusing," the Australian Industry Group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the very least, employers and employees will now be uncertain about whether they can take or make a call out of hours to offer an extra shift," said the country's peak industry group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law, enacted in February, came into force for medium-sized and large companies as of Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smaller companies with fewer than 15 employees will be covered from August 26, 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We encourage workplace participants to educate themselves on the right to disconnect and take a common sense approach to applying it within their workplace," said the head of Australia's workplace relations regulator, Fair Work Ombudsman Anna Booth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the law, workers may be ordered by a tribunal to stop unreasonably refusing out-of-hours contact, and employers likewise may be ordered to stop unreasonably requiring employees to respond, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The question of what is reasonable will "depend on the circumstances", the Fair Work Ombudsman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deciding factors may include the reason for the contact, the nature of the employee's role, and their compensation for working extra hours or being available, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France introduced the right to disconnect in 2017, hoping to tackle the "always on" culture facilitated by smartphones and other digital devices. (AFP)

    UK mobile operator warns about smartphones for kids

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767599_1_20240826081103.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Britain's biggest mobile network operators said on Sunday it will warn parents they should not give smartphones to children under the age of 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new guidance comes after growing concern from parents about the potential pitfalls of smartphone access for young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A recent study by the UK communications regulator found around a quarter of British children aged between five and seven-years-old now had a smartphone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EE will say in new guidance that children should only be given phones with "limited capability devices" allowing them only to text and call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will also advise enabling parental control features for teens under the age of 16 and restrictions on social media for the under-13s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK parents have increasingly started to push back against the trend of giving children one of the devices when they transfer from primary to secondary school at the age of 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widely justified on safety grounds in case of an emergency on the way to or from school, parents fear the phones also potentially open children up to online predators, bullying, social pressure and harmful content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While technology and connectivity have the power to transform lives, we recognise the growing complexity of smartphones can be challenging for parents and caregivers," said Mat Sears, EE corporate affairs director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They need support, which is why we are launching new guidelines on smartphone usage for under 11s, 11 to 13-year-olds, and 13 to 16-year-olds to help them make the best choices for their children through these formative years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US author Jonathan Haidt -- whose recent book "The Anxious Generation" argued that smartphones have rewired children's brains -- has urged parents to act together on smartphone access so it becomes the norm for children not to have one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A child "breaks our heart" by telling us they are excluded from their peer group by being the only one without a phone, he said earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haidt advocates for no smart phones before the age of 14 or social media before 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These things are hard to do as one parent. But if we all do it together -- if even half of us do it together -- then it becomes much easier for our kids," he added. (AFP)

 Israeli jets launched strikes in Lebanon after the military assessed that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement was preparing to fire rockets and missiles towards Israel, the military said early on Sunday.

  "The IDF identified the Hezbollah terrorist organization preparing to fire missiles and rockets toward Israeli territory. In response to these threats, the IDF is striking terror targets in Lebanon," the Israel Defence Forces said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 French police arrested Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov on Saturday at an airport near Paris for alleged offences related to the popular messaging app, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Franco-Russian billionaire, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport north of the French capital on Saturday evening, one of the officials told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had just travelled from Baku, in Azerbaijan, another source close to the case said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov was expected to appear in court on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's OFMIN, an agency tasked with preventing violence against minors, had issued an arrest warrant for Durov as the coordinating agency in a preliminary investigation into alleged offences including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organised crime and promotion of terrorism, one of the sources close to the case said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Durov is suspected of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enough of Telegram's impunity," said one of the investigators, adding they were surprised Durov came to Paris knowing he was a wanted man. (AFP)

    French police hunt man after synagogue fire, blast

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police were on Saturday hunting for a man who, draped in a Palestinian flag, was suspected of setting fires at a synagogue in southern France and triggering an explosion that injured a police officer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the incident was being treated as a potential terror attack and "all means" were being deployed to find the perpetrator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security around Jewish sites was tightened following the attack early on Saturday at Beth Yaacov synagogue in the seaside resort of La Grande Motte, near the city of Montpellier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two cars outside the synagogue were set alight, with a gas canister then likely exploding inside one of the vehicles, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two fires were also started at the entrance of the synagogue, but were quickly put out, with two doors damaged, investigators said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded police officer was injured by the blast after rushing to the scene after the fires were started, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron called the incident "an act of terror", adding on X that "the fight against anti-Semitism is a daily fight".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "all means are being deployed" to apprehend the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  La Grande Motte's mayor, Stephan Rossignol, said that CCTV had picked up images of an individual setting fire to the cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On part of the footage, seen and authenticated by AFP, a man is seen with a Palestinian flag draped around his waist, his head covered by a red Palestinian keffiyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man carried two bottles filled with a yellowish liquid. The footage also seems to show the contours of a handgun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources close to the investigation said the suspect left the scene hurriedly on foot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fires and explosion come amid a heightened state of alert in France and other European countries because of the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said France's national anti-terror prosecutors had been tasked with probing the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "La Grande Motte's synagogue was the target of an attack this morning," Attal said in a post on X. "An anti-Semitic act. Once again, our Jewish fellow citizens are being targeted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin called the incident "an obviously criminal act".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "all means are being deployed to find the perpetrator".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police presence outside Jewish sites in France would be increased following the explosion, the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blast occurred during Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest that runs from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday, with many attending synagogue services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was, however, no religious service ongoing at the time of the incident, a police source said. A rabbi and four other people were inside the synagogue at the time but all were unharmed, investigators said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town of La Grande Motte has about 8,500 permanent residents but the population swells during the summer tourism season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Darmanin said this month that the government had counted 887 anti-Semitic acts in France in the first half of 2024, nearly three times as many as in the same period in 2023.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two NASA astronauts who flew to the International Space Station in June aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule will need to return to Earth on a SpaceX vehicle early next year, NASA said on Saturday, deeming issues with Starliner's propulsion system too risky to carry its first crew home.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agency's decision, tapping Boeing's top space rival to return the astronauts, is one of NASA's most consequential in years. Boeing had hoped the test mission would redeem the Starliner program after years of development problems and over US$1.6 billion in budget overruns since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing is also struggling with quality issues on production of commercial planes, its most important products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, both former military test pilots, became the first crew to ride Starliner on June 5 when they were launched to the ISS for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Starliner's propulsion system suffered a series of glitches beginning in the first 24 hours of its flight to the ISS, triggering months of cascading delays. Five of its 28 thrusters failed and it sprang several leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare reshuffling of NASA's astronaut operations, the two astronauts are now expected to return in February 2025 on a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft due to launch next month as part of a routine astronaut rotation mission. Two of the Crew Dragon's four astronaut seats will be kept empty for Wilmore and Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will undock from the ISS without a crew and attempt to return to Earth as it would have with astronauts aboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing struggled for years to develop Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule designed to compete with Crew Dragon as a second US option for sending astronaut crews to and from Earth's orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner failed a 2019 test to launch to the ISS uncrewed, but mostly succeeded in a 2022 do-over attempt where it also encountered thruster problems. Its June mission with its first crew was required before NASA can certify the capsule for routine flights, but now Starliner's crew certification path has been upended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Starliner docked to the ISS in June, Boeing has scrambled to investigate what caused its thruster mishaps and helium leaks. The company arranged tests and simulations on Earth to gather data that it has used to try and convince NASA officials that Starliner is safe to fly the crew back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But results from that testing raised more difficult engineering questions and ultimately failed to quell NASA officials' concerns about Starliner's ability to make its crewed return trip - the most daunting and complex part of the test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NASA's decision, and Starliner's now-uncertain path to certification, will add to the crises faced by new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who started this month with the goal to rebuild the planemaker's reputation after a door panel dramatically blew off a 737 MAX passenger jet in midair in January.

    Nasa to decide on Boeing Starliner ISS astronauts

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams originally planned to spend eight days at the International Space Station. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767470_1_20240824100555.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa is expected to decide Saturday whether two astronauts who arrived at the International Space Station aboard Boeing's Starliner should return on that craft -- or brace for a longer wait to fly home with rival SpaceX.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latter solution would not only create a fresh public relations headache for Boeing, but possibly result in astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams spending a total of eight months in orbit, not the eight days as originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A decision-making committee, with Nasa chief Bill Nelson sitting in, will meet Saturday to weigh the tough issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US space agency has tentatively scheduled a news conference for 1:00 pm (1700 GMT), presumably to announce its verdict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After years of Starliner development delays, the spacecraft finally lifted off in early June carrying Wilmore and Williams, both veteran astronauts, to the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The capsule was originally set to bring them to Earth after eight days in space, but Nasa put their return on indefinite hold as it studied problems with the craft's propulsion system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa officials are weighing the highly unusual option of bringing the two astronauts back from the flying laboratory not on their own craft, but aboard a previously scheduled SpaceX vehicle in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Engineers at Boeing and Nasa have spent weeks conducting intensive tests on the Starliner's systems, trying to get to the root of the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their worry is that the craft might not have the propulsive power to wrest itself out of orbit and begin the descent toward Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Nasa experts decide the Starliner is not safe, the craft would return without any passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SpaceX Crew-9 mission would then take off in late September, but carrying only two passengers instead of the originally planned four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would remain moored to the ISS until its scheduled return in February, bringing back its own crew members plus their two stranded colleagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an approach would be a stinging blow to the already tarnished image of US giant Boeing, whose airplane arm has been beset in recent years with concerns about safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten years ago, following the retirement of the Space Shuttle, Nasa ordered new vessels from both Boeing and SpaceX that could ferry astronauts to and from the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With two such vehicles available, Nasa reasoned, there would always be a backup in case one of the two experienced problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Elon Musk's SpaceX beat Boeing to the punch and has been the lone vehicle used to taxi astronauts for the past four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's crewed Starliner flight, which followed years of delays and disappointments during the craft's development, was meant to be a last test of the vehicle before it enters regular operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa has said the astronauts on the ISS have plenty of supplies, are trained for extended stays and have plenty of experiments to conduct. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Emergency services at the scene of the attack in Solingen. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767456_1_20240824063306.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people were killed and four severely wounded in a knife attack at a festival in the western German city of Solingen on Friday, according to a spokeswoman for the police in nearby Duesseldorf.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police have launched a "major operation" to find the suspect, who is on the run, the spokeswoman said, adding that a "wide area" had been cordoned off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were at the scene with helicopters and emergency vehicles, and had asked the public to avoid the area, according to the broadcaster ZDF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival was part of a series of events to celebrate the city's 650th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted online, Tim-Oliver Kurzbach, the mayor of Solingen, said the whole city was in "shock, horror and great grief".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all wanted to celebrate our town's anniversary together and now we have to mourn the dead and injured," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kurzbach thanked the emergency services for their work at the scene and expressed sympathy with those who had witnessed the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It tears my heart apart that there was an attack on our city. I have tears in my eyes when I think of those we have lost. I pray for all those who are still fighting for their lives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Solingen is a city of some 150,000 people located an equal distance from Duesseldorf and Cologne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People had gathered in the town on Friday evening for the first day of a three-day "Festival of Diversity", according to the event's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival was set to feature music, street theatre, variety shows and comedians in the city centre and several other areas, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to 75,000 visitors were expected to attend over the three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Solinger Tageblatt newspaper reported that one of the co-organisers of the festival had come on stage to cancel the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd were also asked to leave the city centre, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the announcement, thousands of attendees cleared the area, the paper reported, with a journalist at the scene describing the atmosphere as "ghostly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People left the scene in shock, but calmly," Philipp Mueller, one of the organisers, told the newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness who spoke to the Tageblatt said he was a few metres from the attack, not far from the stage, and "understood from the expression on the singer's face that something was wrong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, a metre away from me, a person fell," said the man, Lars Breitzke, who at first thought it was someone who was drunk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But when he turned around, he saw other people lying on the ground and several pools of blood, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany has seen a series of knife attacks over the past 12 months, with Interior Minister Nancy Faeser promising to crack down on knife crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police officer was killed and five people were wounded in a knife attack at a far-right rally in the city of Mannheim in late May. (AFP)

    Independent Kennedy drops US poll bid, backs Trump

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Robert F Kennedy Jr announces that he's dropping his presidential run. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767443_1_20240824033757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr said on Friday he would suspend his campaign, and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, likely ending a presidential bid that he began as a Democrat trading on one of the most famous names in American politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His campaign indicated that he feared staying in the race would siphon support from former President Trump, who is locked in a tight contest with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An environmental lawyer, anti-vaccine activist and son and nephew of two titans of Democratic politics who were assassinated during the turbulent 1960s, Kennedy entered the race in April 2023 as a challenger to President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With voters at the time turned off by both the aging Biden and the legally embattled Trump, interest in Kennedy soared. He shifted his plans and decided to run as an independent, and a November 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Kennedy drawing the support of 20 percent of Americans in a three-way race with Biden and Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ran a high-profile advertisement during the February 2024 Super Bowl that invoked his father, US Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, US President John F Kennedy, and drew outrage from much of his high-profile family, who condemned his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In exchange for endorsing Trump, Kennedy was hoping for a job in a potential Trump administration, a super PAC supporting Kennedy said on Wednesday. He also wanted Trump to allow his political movement to continue in some fashion, which could include staying on the ballot in some states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kennedy said this month in a video posted online that he dumped a dead bear in New York City's Central Park a decade ago and staged it to look like a bike had hit it. He proclaimed he had "so many skeletons in my closet" after a former family babysitter accused him of sexual assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He denied that a picture of him posing with the barbecued carcass of a large animal belonged to a canine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And then there was the brain worm. Kennedy had a parasite in his brain more than a decade ago, but has since fully recovered, a fact unearthed by the New York Times and confirmed by the campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those stories prompted ridicule from late-night talk show hosts. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi urged President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday to sit down for talks with Russia to end the war in Ukraine and offered to act as a friend to help bring peace as the two leaders met in wartime Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history comes at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in Februaru 2022, with Moscow making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The optics closely resembled the Indian leader's visit to Moscow last month where he called for peace and embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin, angering Ukraine where a Russian missile strike hit a children's hospital on the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The road to resolution can only be found through dialogue and diplomacy. And we should move in that direction without wasting any time. Both sides should sit together to find a way out of this crisis," Modi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to assure you that India is ready to play an active role in any efforts towards peace. If I can play any role in this personally, I will do that, I want to assure you as a friend," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what Kyiv made of his remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India, which traditionally has close economic and defence ties with Moscow, has publicly criticised the deaths of innocent people in the war, but also strengthened its economic ties with Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both leaders described Modi's visit as "historic" in their statements, in which Modi spoke second and Zelenskiy did not have an opportunity to respond to the call for dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskiy said that "the matter of ending the war and a just peace are the priority for Ukraine".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that talks were out of the question after Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police announced on Friday that a probe into betting on the date of the last general election had ended, saying the bar for misconduct had not been met.
 <br>
  <br/>
  London's Metropolitan Police said in late June it would investigate a "small number" of bets placed on the timing of last month's elections, as part of a joint probe with the gambling watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scandal overshadowed the latter stages of campaigning ahead of the July 5 poll, after it emerged senior Conservative officials and one of then-prime minister Rishi Sunak's aides had placed bets shortly before he announced the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met also arrested one of its officers on suspicion of misconduct in public office over election betting claims, while six other officers were identified as having placed bets on its date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission launched an investigation into whether any broke laws on "cheating" while the Met opened a separate inquiry into whether other criminal offences had been committed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While political bets are allowed in the UK, using insider knowledge to make them is against the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Britain's biggest police force announced its criminal investigation had concluded with no action being taken, including against the officer who had been arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Met said the "high bar" for proving misconduct in public office had not been met, following advice from the country's prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gambling Commission investigation remains ongoing and could still result in criminal charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile the Met's internal watchdog unit is continuing to investigate the seven officers alleged to have placed bets on the election date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These allegations caused a significant dent in public confidence during the election campaign and it was right that they were investigated to explore all possible offences," Detective Superintendent Katherine Goodwin said in a statement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 14 people were killed, 16 others injured and several more believed to be missing after a bus carrying dozens of Indian pilgrims drove off a key highway on Friday in Nepal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials said the bus veered off Prithvi Highway and rolled towards a fast-flowing river, stopping on the rocky bank just shy of the rushing, murky water. The top part of the bus was ripped, but the wreckage did not plunge into the Marsyangdi River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An armed police spokesperson said that, among those pulled out of from the bus, 14 were declared dead and 16 were injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials could not yet say how many more were missing or the exact number of people on the bus when it crashed, but they estimated there were some four dozen on board at the time of the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police and army rescuers were helping to pull people from the wreckage near Abukhaireni, a town about 120 kilometres west of the capital, Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bus from neighbouring Indian town of Gorakhpur was heading toward Kathmandu from the resort town of Pokhara on Friday when it drove off the highway midway in the journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, two buses were swept by landslides not too far from Friday's accident site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 65 people on board those two buses, only three survived and only about half the bodies were recovered. The wreckage of those buses have not been found yet but authorities have continued to search.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bus accidents in Nepal are mostly due to poorly maintained roads and vehicles and much of the country is covered by mountains with narrow roads. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Kamala Harris called on Americans to join her to “chart a new way forward” as she accepted the Democratic nomination on Thursday, arguing her personal story and her career as a prosecutor made her uniquely qualified to protect their interests and beat Republican candidate Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taking the stage to a thunderous standing ovation at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Harris sought to introduce herself to the American public and outline her vision for leading the nation for the next four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' address in Chicago caps a whirlwind eight weeks in American politics and manifests the stunning reversal of Democratic fortunes just 75 days until Election Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party leaders who had publicly despaired over President Joe Biden's candidacy after his disastrous debate against Trump in June, were jubilant both at the historic nature of Harris' candidacy which has boosted their hopes for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Harris became the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to accept a major party's presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If elected, she would become the first female US president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected. But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris talked about being raised primarily by her mother in San Francisco's East Bay after her parents divorced, and being raised as well by friends and caregivers who were “family by love.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also detailed a key part of her political origin story, when Wanda, her best friend from high school, confided in her that she was being abused by her stepfather and came to live with Harris' family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor. To protect people like Wanda,” Harris said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outlining her career as a prosecutor, state attorney general, senator and now vice president, Harris said, “My entire career I’ve only had one client: the people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said Trump has only ever acted in the interests of "the only client he has ever had: himself.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As she took the stage, she saw a sea of female delegates and Democratic supporters wearing white — the colour of women’s suffrage — the movement that culminated with American women securing the right to vote in 1920.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris also pledged to get a Gaza ceasefire deal completed and said as US president she would stand with Ukraine and not "cozy up" to dictators like Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the time to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done." (Agencies)

    Canada to order rail companies to resume operations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Canadian government moved quickly on Thursday to end an unprecedented rail stoppage, announcing it would ask the country's industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order that could come in a few days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Canada's top two railroads had locked out more than 9,000 unionised workers earlier in the day, triggering a simultaneous rail stoppage that business groups said could inflict hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon told reporters he was acting "to ensure that the activities of both of these rail companies immediately resume" and said he was referring the matter to the board for binding arbitration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MacKinnon said he was confident the board would issue a back-to-work order within the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I assume that the trains will be running within days," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The companies – Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City – and the Teamsters union blamed each other for the work stoppage after multiple rounds of talks failed to yield an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision marked a change of mind by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which had long made clear its desire to see the matter settled at the bargaining table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We gave negotiations every possible opportunity to succeed ... but we have an impasse here," said MacKinnon. "And that is why we have come to this decision today." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities confirmed late on Thursday that five Chinese nationals were among nine people who died when a small plane crashed minutes after taking off from Bangkok’s main airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Media reports in Thailand say the dead included children aged 12 and 13, as well as three adults in their 40s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other four victims were Thai nationals, including two pilots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok said Thai authorities had confirmed the death of five Chinese nationals, and it was seeking further information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Immigration Department said no SAR residents were involved in the tragedy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports say the jet took off from Bangkok’s main Suvarnabhumi Airport at 2.46pm. Air traffic control lost radio and radar contact with the aircraft 11 minutes later, when it was an estimated 35 kilometres southeast of the airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thai media said rescuers found no survivors at the crash site in a mangrove swamp in Chachoengsao province about 40 kilometres from the airport. Rescue teams continued their work into the night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cessna Caravan C208B operated by the Thai Flying Service Company had been bound for the coastal province of Krabi. (Additional reporting by AP, Xinhua)

    US top court revives Arizona voter rules

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The US Supreme Court voted to reinstate Arizona's voting rules in part. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767277_1_20240823034309.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court on Thursday revived part of an Arizona voter law requiring documented proof of US citizenship to register to vote, in response to a request from the Republican National Committee and Arizona Republicans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The justices in a 5-4 ruling agreed to reinstate a provision of the law after a federal judge blocked it in response to legal challenges by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration and advocacy groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision comes before the November 5 election in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is facing off against Republican former President Donald Trump, who continues to falsely claim that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arizona's Republican-controlled legislature adopted new restrictions on voter registration in 2022. The law requires applicants who submit a federal registration form to provide evidence of US citizenship to vote in presidential elections or vote by mail in any federal election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voter registrants who use a separate, state-created form face even tighter restrictions. Without proof of US citizenship, state applications are rejected in their entirety, and officials who fail to do so face a minor felony charge under the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court's ruling revived the restriction related to the state voter registration form, but kept intact a judicial decision blocking the provision that sought to tighten limits on the federal form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts joined with fellow conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch to grant Republicans' request in part, though Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the entire request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, along with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, would have denied the request in full. (Reuters)

    Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Venezuelan court affirms Maduro as election winner" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767274_1_20240823013000.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal on Thursday ratified President Nicolas Maduro's victory in the July 28 presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The supreme tribunal has reviewed material from the electoral authority and agrees that Maduro won the election, court president Caryslia Rodriguez said, adding the decision cannot be appealed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The electoral material assessed is certified unobjectionably and the results of the presidential election of July 28 released by the national electoral council, where Nicolas Maduro was elected president of the republic, are validated," said Rodriguez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electoral authority has said since the night of the election that Maduro won just over half of votes, though it has not published full tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has published online what it says are 83 percent of voting machine tallies, which give its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez a hearty 67 percent support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Western countries have urged full publication of results, while Russia, China and others have congratulated Maduro on his victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme court would be in violation of separation of powers rules in the constitution if it were to carry out any electoral functions, thus making its ruling null, the opposition said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ratification gives Maduro, who took office in 2013, another six-year term, set to begin in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president, a long-time ruling party official before he rose to the presidency, had asked the court to verify the results. The court's judges summoned all the candidates to hand over the copies of voting machine tallies they are entitled to by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez did not attend the summons. The opposition says the court, though constitutionally independent, operates as an arm of the ruling party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition's failure to hand over its copies and Gonzalez's non-appearance are "blatant disrespect", Rodriguez said, and exposes him to sanctions, though she did not specify what kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 23 protesters have been killed at anti-government demonstrations since the election, and some 2,400 arrested, according to the United Nations. Maduro says the demonstrators are extremists. (Reuters)

    Indonesia shelves elections shake-up amid protests

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767270_1_20240822233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's parliament shelved planned changes to electoral laws on Thursday after protesters in the capital set fires and faced down tear gas and water cannon over legislation they say would weaken opponents of the outgoing president and his successor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislature, dominated by supporters of outgoing President Joko Widodo and his successor, Prabowo Subianto, was scheduled to vote to reverse changes to election laws made by the constitutional court, a ruling that effectively reopened a chance for a vocal government critic to run in regional elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties backing Prabowo had earlier this week rallied behind a single candidate for the influential post of Jakarta governor, killing off chances of the president-elect's rival, Anies Baswedan, from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anies at the time needed the backing from a party or a coalition of parties with at least 20 percent of seats in the local parliament, under rules for regional elections in place since 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tuesday's Constitutional Court ruling had lowered the threshold to under 10 percent, giving Anies a chance to be nominated by the only party that has not named a candidate, PDIP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national parliament had sought to return to the previous threshold, contradicting the country's highest court in a move critics said would favour the outgoing president and his family, and the incoming government, as they consolidate power and freeze out any opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a republic. It's a democracy, but if its leadership is decided by one person, or an oligarchy, we can't accept that," said 29-year-old teacher Afif Sidik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, deputy parliament speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad said that deliberations would be resumed by the incoming parliament, meaning there would be no change for this year's regional elections, scheduled for November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That means Anies will be able to seek the Jakarta governor's office if PDIP nominates him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parliament decision came as security forces fired tear gas and water cannon as protesters breached and set ablaze part of the gates of parliament, while demonstrations broke out across the country against the election law changes. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at a hotel in South Korea has killed seven people and injured 12 others, fire authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fire began on the eighth floor of the nine-story hotel in Bucheon, just west of the capital Seoul at around 7.40pm on Thursday, before being put out in about two hours, according to the interior ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven people died, mostly guests, and 12 were sent to hospitals for treatment, including three in critical condition, said Lee Sang-don, an official at the Bucheon fire station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those killed were a couple who jumped out the windows onto an air mattress installed in front of the building, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was unfolded normally but appeared to have flipped over when they jumped down," he told a televised briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities were looking into the exact cause of the incident, adding there were no sprinklers inside, which was not mandatory when the building was completed in 2003, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Lee Sang-min ordered all-out rescue efforts by mobilising all available resources, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 70 vehicles and 160 firefighters were dispatched to the scene, Yonhap news agency said, citing provincial fire authorities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Italian coast guard on Thursday said the body of British tech magnate Mike Lynch was among those recovered off the coast of Sicily from the wreckage of a superyacht.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One woman remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies of Lynch, who had been celebrating his recent acquittal on fraud charges with his family and the people who had defended him at trial in the United States, and five others were recovered by rescue crews following Monday's tragedy.

  The Bayesian, a 56-metre British-flagged yacht, went down in a storm early Monday as it was moored about a kilometre offshore. Civil protection officials said they believe the ship was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout, and sank quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators are now looking at why the Bayesian sank, killing at least six people. A seventh remains missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen of the 22 people aboard survived, including a mother who reported holding her one-year-old baby over the waves to save her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divers have struggled to find the bodies in the yacht’s hull on the seabed 50 metres underwater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We would need a crystal ball to know when we'll be able to find the next body," said Luca Cari, spokesperson for the fire rescue service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's very difficult to move inside the wreckage. Moving just one metre can take up to 24 hours,” Cari said. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tim Walz formally accepted his nomination to be the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate in a keynote address on Wednesday at the party's convention in Chicago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It's the honour of my life to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States. We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple reason -- we love this country," Walz said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Minnesota governor, who was little known in America 15 days ago, acknowledged he had never given such a big speech but said that as a former high school football coach, "I have given a lot of pep talks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd responded with chants of "Coach, Coach, Coach!" Walz brought his plain-speaking style and small-town values to the national stage, joined by a litany of political luminaries and star entertainers on the third night of the Democratic National Convention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said America should be a place where children don't go hungry, healthcare and housing are human rights, "and the government stays the hell out of your bedroom," referring to Republican assaults on abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He spoke of preserving the freedoms that Democrats say are under attack from Trump, who is making his third major-party run for the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz said a second Trump White House would serve nobody except the wealthy and most extreme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kamala Harris will address the gathering on its final night on Thursday when she will accept her party's nomination for president. (Agencies)

    Ship catches fire after attack off Yemen: UK agency

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Houthi rebels have waged a nine-month-old campaign against international shipping in the Red Sea in support of Hamas in the Gaza war. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767125_1_20240822013132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three projectiles hit a merchant vessel off Yemen's rebel-held port city of Hodeida on Wednesday, causing a fire onboard and leaving the ship without engine power, a British maritime security agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Athens identified the vessel as the Greek-flagged Sounion oil tanker, and Greece's Maritime Affairs Minister Christos Stylianides condemned "a serious threat" to international shipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tanker was "struck by two unidentified projectiles before being hit by a third," said the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is run by Britain's Royal Navy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its crew earlier exchanged fire with two small vessels, one with three to five people onboard while the second carried around 10, said the agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a fire onboard and the vessel has lost engine power," UKMTO said, adding that "the vessel is drifting and not under command."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the UKMTO and the Greek port authority said there were no reports of casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson for the port authority said the Sounion, an oil products tanker owned by Greek shipping company Delta Tankers, carried a crew of 25 people, mostly Filipinos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had departed from Iraq and was destined for a port near Athens where many refineries are based, the Greek port authority said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the ship could have been hit either by missiles or drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the attack came as the Iran-backed Houthi rebels keep up a nine-month-old campaign against international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden that they say is in support of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stylianides in a statement "condemned the attack, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and a serious threat to the security of international shipping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such acts put the lives of seafarers at risk and disrupt the free movement of goods along vital maritime routes," the minister added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate incident south of the Yemeni port city of Aden on Wednesday, another ship reported three explosions in the water in close proximity, UKMTO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew are reported safe and vessel is proceeding to the next port of call, the agency added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis' campaign of rocket and drone attacks has severely disrupted maritime traffic through the Red Sea, which normally accounts for up to 12 percent of world trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many merchant vessels passing through the Red Sea now have security teams on board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States and Britain have responded to the attacks by striking Houthi targets in Yemen since January, but it has done little to deter the rebels. (AFP)

    Israel kills Fatah leader accused of 'terror attacks'

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767121_1_20240822012148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel killed a senior member of the Palestinian Fatah movement in Lebanon on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating attacks in the West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In response, the slain militant's Fatah party accused Israel of seeking to "ignite a regional war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khalil Maqdah was killed in a strike on his car in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, according to Fatah and a Lebanese security source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said an air force "aircraft struck the terrorist Khalil Hussein Khalil Al-Maqdah in the area of Sidon in southern Lebanon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said Maqdah was the brother of Mounir Maqdah, who heads the Lebanese branch of Fatah's armed wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, and accused them both of "directing terror attacks and smuggling weapons" to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It alleged that the pair "collaborate on behalf of" Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack marks the first such reported attack on a senior member of Fatah, the movement led by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, in more than 10 months of cross-border clashes between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement following the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fatah said Maqdah had been killed "in a cowardly assassination carried out by ... Zionist (Israeli) warplanes on Sidon," describing him as "one of the leaders" of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades in Lebanon, the movement's armed wing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said Maqdah had "a central role" in "supporting the Palestinian people and its resistance" during the Gaza war and an "important role in supporting resistance cells" for years in the West Bank. (AFP)

    Indian PM Modi begins landmark Poland, Ukraine visit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Indian PM Modi begins landmark Poland, Ukraine visit" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767123_1_20240822003604.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's Narendra Modi launched on Wednesday his historic trip to Poland and Ukraine, where the premier has pledged to campaign for a peaceful resolution of Russia's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Modi will be the first Indian prime minister to make a Ukraine trip and first in 45 years to travel to Poland, Kyiv's staunch ally that is a key transit for foreign leaders heading to its war-torn neighbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and President Andrzej Duda on Thursday, as well as with Indian nationals living in the Central European country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This visit will add momentum to the India-Poland friendship and benefit the people of our nations," Modi said on X upon landing in Warsaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Modi commemorated an Indian maharaja who sheltered Polish children during World War II, before laying flowers at a war memorial and delivering a speech to the Indian community in Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland "needs a lasting partnership with India," deputy Polish Prime Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told reporters before Modi's visit, adding that economic ties would also be on the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi has trodden a delicate balance between maintaining India's historically warm ties with Russia while courting closer security partnerships with Western nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His government has avoided explicit condemnations of Russia's 2022 operation in Ukraine, instead urging both sides to resolve their differences through dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a friend and partner, we hope for an early return of peace and stability in the region," Modi said in a statement published on Wednesday before his departure for Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Kyiv, Modi will hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and "share perspectives on peaceful resolution of the ongoing Ukraine conflict," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "India has consistently advocated for diplomacy and dialogue to reach a negotiated settlement," Indian foreign ministry official Tanmaya Lal said before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky announced on Monday that "a number of documents are also expected to be signed" during the meeting with Modi, whose previous diplomatic efforts drew condemnation from Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, hours after Russia pummelled multiple cities across Ukraine, Modi visited Moscow and was pictured hugging Putin at his residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also visited Russia in 2019 and hosted Putin in New Delhi two years later, weeks before Moscow began its offensive against Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India has largely shied away from explicit condemnation of Russia and abstained on UN resolutions targeting the Kremlin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Russia's fight with Ukraine has also had a human cost for India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi has pushed Moscow to return several of its citizens who signed up for "support jobs" with the Russian military but were later sent to fight on the frontlines in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least five Indian soldiers have been killed in the conflict. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistani man appeared in court on Wednesday to face charges of cyber terrorism after allegedly spreading disinformation on his clickbait website thought to have fuelled anti-immigration riots in Britain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Farhan Asif was accused of publishing an article on his Channel3Now website falsely claiming that a Muslim asylum seeker was suspected in a deadly knife attack on children in the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK authorities have blamed online misinformation for sparking days of riots which targeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers as well as police officers and other properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is a 31-year-old software engineer with no journalism credentials, apart from running the Channel3Now website, which served as a source of income for him," a senior official at Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Initial investigations indicate that his sole intent was to make money through clickbait content."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asif appeared at a Lahore district court on Wednesday charged with cyber terrorism and was remanded to custody for one day, the official added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The article with the false information was published on Channel3Now just hours after the attack and was widely cited in viral social media posts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen English towns and cities saw unrest and riots after the July 29 knife attack that killed three girls during a dance class in Southport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man charged with murder and attempted murder over the stabbing spree, Axel Rudakubana, was born in Britain to parents who hail from Rwanda, an overwhelmingly Christian country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have blamed far-right elements for helping to stir up the disorder. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Divers searching for six missing people following the sinking of a superyacht off Sicily in a storm have found two bodies, sources told media.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The discovery brings the confirmed death toll to three. It was not immediately clear who had been found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The missing include British tech tycoon Mike Lynch and the chairman of Morgan Stanley International Jonathan Bloomer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long superyacht, was carrying 22 people, and was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it capsized during a fierce storm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen people survived, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inspection of the wreck, lying sideways at a depth of around 50 metres, was a "long and complex" operation, the Italian fire department said, with inside spaces obstructed by furniture and debris, and scuba divers having just 8-10 minutes beneath the water before needing to resurface.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the coast guard deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide "useful and timely elements" for prosecutors looking into the disaster. (Agencies)

    Blinken says 'time is of the essence' for Gaza truce

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken said in Qatar on Tuesday there was no time to waste in securing a Gaza ceasefire deal, as he wrapped up a Middle East tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Time is of the essence" for a truce deal between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas, Blinken told reporters at Doha airport as he prepared to fly back to Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This needs to get done, and it needs to get done in the days ahead, and we will do everything possible to get it across the finish line," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said on Monday in Tel Aviv that Israel has accepted a proposal by the United States to bridge the gaps between the two sides and urged Hamas to follow suit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports however quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as saying his government would insist on keeping control of the Philadelphi corridor on the Gaza-Egypt border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken, asked about Netanyahu's remarks, said that since the start of the conflict it was made "very clear that the United States does not accept any long-term occupation of Gaza by Israel."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And recent talks have been "very clear on the schedule and location of IDF (army) withdrawals from Gaza, and Israel has agreed to that," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He declined explicitly to reject Netanyahu's reported remarks, although another US official earlier said the stance was "not constructive" to closing the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1967 and withdrew troops and settlers in 2005, although it has since maintained a crippling blockade on the Palestinian territory and imposed a siege during the current war. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Scotland recorded an increase in drug deaths last year, official figures showed on Tuesday, as the country continues to have one of the highest rates of such deaths in Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deaths by drug misuse have blighted some of Scotland's poorest communities for decades and are often branded its "national shame."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Records of Scotland (NRS) said drugs claimed the lives of 1,172 Scots in 2023 – up 121, or 12 percent, from 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland had recorded its lowest drug death figures in five years in 2022, sparking hopes that the country had turned a corner in its fight against drug misuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 279 fewer people died from drug misuse that year compared to 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The longer-term trend shows that drug misuse deaths are still much more common than they were over two decades ago," said Phillipa Haxton of the NRS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opioid drugs – such as heroin and methadone – were implicated in 80 percent of all drug deaths last year, according to the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures also highlighted a growing threat from super-strong synthetic opioids such as nitazenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They showed that the number of men who died from drug misuse rose by 113 in 2022 to 805 last year, with men twice as likely to die as women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cities of Glasgow and Dundee had the highest rates of death, according to the data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People in the most deprived areas of Scotland are more than 15 times as likely to die from drug misuse compared to people in the least deprived areas," said the NRS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scotland regularly appears at the top of studies measuring drug deaths per million people in European countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the UK, the drug misuse mortality rate was 2.7 times higher in Scotland than in England and Northern Ireland using data from 2022. (AFP)

    US official says Netanyahu remarks 'not constructive'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US official on Tuesday criticised "maximalist" remarks attributed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on maintaining control of the Gaza-Egypt border, saying it was not helpful to reaching a ceasefire with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Maximalist statements like this are not constructive to getting a ceasefire deal across the finish line," said the senior official travelling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the Middle East, requesting anonymity to talk about sensitive discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such remarks "certainly risk the ability of implementing-level, working-level and technical talks to be able to move forward (once) both parties agree to a bridging proposal," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said that Blinken stood by his public statement in Tel Aviv on Monday that Netanyahu had agreed to a US proposal to bridge the gaps on a ceasefire laid out on May 31 by President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, in reported remarks to families of victims of attacks, said that Israel would insist on maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor between Gaza and Egypt which Israeli forces seized from Hamas in the more than 10-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We saw the prime minister's comments, especially on some of these items. We're not going to negotiate in public," the US official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said that such "technical" issues would need to be ironed out in further discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing Secretary Blinken and the United States are convinced of is the need for getting the ceasefire deal across the finish line," the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be additional conversations on technical specifics, many of which of course are being discussed in the press, which is certainly not helpful to the process," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States expects diplomacy to move forward this week between Israel and Hamas on reaching a ceasefire, despite uncertainties in particular on Hamas's response, the official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We fully expect this process to continue into this week," the official said, without confirming any formal meeting this week involving Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House last week, when presenting the bridging proposal in Doha, said that it expected new talks on finalising the deal to take place later this week in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived in Doha late Tuesday for talks with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, after meeting the leaders of Egypt and Israel. (AFP)

    Putin likens Kursk incursion to Beslan school massacre

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Vladimir Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766960_1_20240821011916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday likened Ukraine's incursion into Russia to the 2004 Beslan school massacre, in which some 330 people died in a hostage siege.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin visited the school for the first time in almost 20 years, paying tribute to the victims at memorials, including a cemetery and the site of the destroyed school, where Chechen militants took more than 1,000 people hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meeting mothers who lost children in the siege, Putin said that Russia's enemies are again trying to destabilise the country, referring to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just as we fought the terrorists, today we have to fight those who are carrying out crimes in the Kursk region," Putin said, referring to Ukraine's cross-border offensive that began two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But just as we achieved our goals in the fight with terrorism, we will achieve these goals also in this direction in the fight with neo-Nazis," Putin added, sitting opposite three women from the Mothers of Beslan group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And we will undoubtedly punish the criminals, there can be no doubt of that," Putin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mothers of Beslan group has long called for an objective probe into the attack and the Russian authorities' response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The September 2004 siege lasted some 50 hours, ending in a gunfight when Russian special forces stormed the building following explosions in the school gym, where the hostages were being held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege in the Caucasus region of North Ossetia came amid a guerilla insurgency by Islamist Chechen separatists, branded "terrorists" by Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin launched a major Russian offensive to quash Chechnya's armed bid for independence in late 1999, weeks before becoming president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war against the Chechen insurgency helped fuel Putin's initial popularity, but at the end of 2019 he described the Beslan siege as a "personal pain" that would remain with him for life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin and the Kremlin were criticised for their handling of the attack at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the meeting with Putin, the Mothers of Beslan complained that Russia's investigation into the school siege has never been completed, the group's co-chairwoman Aneta Gadiyeva told the Agentstvo news outlet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This part of the meeting, unlike Putin's remarks about Ukraine, was not televised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gadiyeva said Putin told the women that he had not known this and would ask the head of the Investigative Committee to intervene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2017 that Russia's handling of the siege had "serious failings" in terms of preventing the attack and its use of excessive lethal force and called on Moscow to take measures to establish the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack came two years after Chechen fighters took hundreds hostage in a Moscow theatre, a stand-off which saw more than 130 killed – most by sleeping gas pumped into the theatre by Russian special forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack," the Kremlin press service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also laid red roses at a monument to members of Russia's special forces who died during the storming of School Number One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An "international cultural and patriotic centre for the prevention of terrorism" has been set up at the site of the former school, the Kremlin's press service said on Telegram. (AFP)

    Mpox 'not the new Covid', says WHO

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Democratic Republic of Congo Health minister Samuel-Roger Kamba announces a dramatic rise in cases in his country. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766951_1_20240820224627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The mpox outbreak is not another Covid-19, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday, because much is already known about the virus and the means to control it.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While more research is needed on the Clade 1b strain which triggered the UN agency into declaring an international health emergency, the spread of mpox can be reined in, the WHO's European director Hans Kluge said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mpox is not the new Covid," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know how to control mpox. And, in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether," he told a media briefing in Geneva, via video-link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July 2022, the WHO declared an emergency over the international outbreak of the less severe Clade 2b strain of mpox, which mostly affected men who have sex with men. The alarm was lifted in May 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We controlled mpox in Europe thanks to the direct engagement with the most affected communities," said Kluge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robust surveillance, investigating case contacts, behaviour changes in the affected communities and vaccination all contributed to controlling the outbreak, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kluge said the risk to the general population was low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Are we going to go in lockdown in the WHO European region, (as if) it's another Covid-19? The answer is clearly: 'no'," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1b is spreading mainly through sexual transmission among adults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kluge said it was also possible that someone in the acute phase of mpox infection, especially with blisters in the mouth, may transmit the virus to close contacts by droplets, in circumstances such as in the home or in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The modes of transmission are still a bit unclear. More research is required," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency was not recommending the use of masks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not recommending mass vaccination. We are recommending to use vaccines in outbreak settings for the groups who are most at risk," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO declared an international health emergency on August 14, concerned by the rise in cases of Clade 1b in the DR Congo and its spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two subtypes of mpox: the more virulent and deadlier Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1b is a new offshoot of Clade 1, which is now called Clade 1a.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clade 1b outbreak in northeastern DRC was first detected in September last year and is spreading rapidly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine Smallwood, WHO Europe's emergency operations programme area manager, explained that the split of Clade 1 into 1a and 1b reflects "change in the evolution of the virus."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1a traditionally has outbreaks resulting from infections from sick animals, with some limited follow-on transmission between humans at the household level, or within communities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with Clade 1B, "we have not isolated or detected zoonotic transmission of Clade 1b," said Smallwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it seems to be a strain of the virus that's circulating exclusively within the human population."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts are trying to work out if there is a difference in disease severity between Clades 1a and 1b.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The available vaccines were originally developed for smallpox, and are effective against other viruses in the wider orthopoxvirus family, such as mpox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two mpox vaccines have been used in recent years – MVA-BN, produced by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, and Japan's LC16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also ACAM2000, a second-generation smallpox jab approved in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether a person vaccinated post-exposure to mpox goes on to develop the disease depends on the early administration of the vaccine, said Smallwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vaccines can also be used preventatively in people likely to be exposed to the virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jasarevic said results from effectiveness studies indicated that a good level of protection was provided against mpox following vaccination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it takes several weeks to develop immunity after being vaccinated. (AFP)

    Blinken builds case for Gaza ceasefire

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives from Israel at El-Alamein in Egypt on the next leg of his Mideast trip to secure a truce in Gaza. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766883_2_20240820165113.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Egypt on Tuesday for talks on a Gaza ceasefire as he pushes Hamas to accept a deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday, will afterwards head to Qatar, which along with Egypt is brokering negotiations for a truce in the 10-month Gaza conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His departure from Tel Aviv came as an Israeli kibbutz community announced the death in captivity in Gaza of 79-year-old hostage Avraham Munder, underlining the urgency of a truce and hostage release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kibbutz Nir Oz said Munder had endured "physical and mental torture for months" and called his death "murder". There was no immediate comment from his captors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat flew to El Alamein, the Mediterranean city famous for a World War II battle in 1942, to speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at his summer palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will then head to meet Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, in Doha, the scene of ceasefire talks last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Doha negotiations, the United States presented proposals to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas and seal the May 31 ceasefire blueprint laid out by US President Joe Biden, who has faced growing domestic criticism over the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said on Monday that Israel had accepted the US proposal and that he would speak to Egypt and Qatar to gauge the reaction of Hamas, which has no direct relationship with the United States as it considers the militants a terrorist group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is, I think, a real sense of urgency here, across the region, on the need to get this over the finish line and to do it as soon as possible," Blinken said on Monday in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States is deeply committed to getting this job done, to getting it done now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also said the ceasefire proposal could be the "last chance" for a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He played down a public rejection by Hamas of the modifications in the latest proposal and said Israel was ready to send a delegation to new talks later this week, which the United States previously said would take place in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A series of reports suggested that Israel has raised new conditions in recent talks, including insisting on control of the Gaza border with Egypt that Israel seized from Hamas. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An emotional Joe Biden won a huge ovation as he gave a farewell speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday, after Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance to thank him for being an "incredible" US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I love you," the tearful 81-year-old told the crowd to deafening cheers, less than a month after dropping out of the White House race against Donald Trump and passing the torch to his vice president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden took to the stage to chants of "We love you Joe" from the same party which had pushed him out over concerns about his age, in one of the biggest political shocks in US political history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We both know we have more to do, but we're moving in the right direction," he said, referring to himself and the 59-year-old Harris, who, in the space of a few breathtaking weeks, has turned the presidential race upside down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president has injected new life into the Democratic Party and wiped out Republican rival Donald Trump's lead in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She heaped lavish tribute on Biden, even breaking with tradition to speak on the first night of the convention in praise of her boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president Joe Biden," said Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are forever grateful to you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he has been so often in his five-decade-long political journey, Biden was surrounded by family, with wife Jill Biden and their daughter Ashley introducing him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Joe and I have been together for almost 50 years. And still, there are moments when I fall in love with him all over again," the first lady said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democrats are in an exuberant mood in Chicago, daring to hope for victory in November that seemed inconceivable just weeks ago after Biden's disastrous debate against Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Monday's first night of the convention was an emotional one on many levels, and for many of the key players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hillary Clinton, who lost against Trump in 2016 in her own bid to become America's first woman president, backed Harris to finally break the glass ceiling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Something is happening in America, you can feel it -- something we've worked for and dreamed of for a long time," the former secretary of state and first lady said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris will formally accept the party's nomination on the final day Thursday, in her biggest chance yet to define her candidacy in front of a huge audience of tens of millions of American voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her star turn will cap a week where the biggest names from the party's past will endorse her as its future, with former president Barack Obama speaking on Tuesday, and ex-president Bill Clinton introducing Harris's running mate Tim Walz on Wednesday. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US security agencies on Monday said Iran was behind a recent hack targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign, accusing Tehran of seeking to influence the 2024 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed the Trump campaign claim from earlier in August that it had been targeted, potentially by Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns," the security agencies said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former president Trump's campaign, which the [intelligence community] attributes to Iran," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Iran's mission to the United Nations denied the country's role in the hack and challenged Washington to release evidence for the claim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such allegations are unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing," the mission said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbours neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the US presidential election. Should the US government genuinely believe in the validity of its claims, it should furnish us with the pertinent evidence -- if any -- to which we will respond accordingly," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States goes to the polls on November 5, with both Trump's and Democratic rival Kamala Harris's campaigns saying they had been targeted by cyber attacks in recent weeks. (AFP)

 Former US Representative George Santos pleaded guilty on Monday to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with the federal fraud case that led to his expulsion from Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New York Republican entered the plea in a courtroom in Long Island just weeks before his trial was set to begin in early September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was indicted on felony charges that he stole from political donors, used campaign contributions to pay for personal expenses, lied to Congress about his wealth and collected unemployment benefits while actually working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was expelled from the US House after an ethics investigation found “overwhelming evidence” that he had broken the law and exploited his public position for his own profit. (AP)

    Trump posts images implying Taylor Swift supports him

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump's Truth Social platform shared AI-generated images appearing to show he has Taylor Swift's support. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766817_1_20240820024552.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has shared doctored images on social media showing Taylor Swift and her fans support his presidential campaign, in an apparent effort to tap into the pop singer's mega star power in the US election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swift has not yet publicly thrown her weight behind any presidential candidate in the November 5 election, but she backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and has previously been critical of Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Trump shared screenshots of posts with manipulated images – including some that an expert said appeared to be AI-generated – suggesting that the pop star and her fans, popularly known as Swifties, support his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his Truth Social post, which includes a poster of Swift clad in an Uncle Sam outfit and instructing her fans to vote for Trump, the former president wrote: "I accept!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That poster is either "AI generated or just classically manipulated," said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The post also includes photos of women wearing shirts with the slogan "Swifties for Trump," some of which Farid said had the "tell-tale signs of being AI generated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What makes the mash-up "particularly devious" is that is a combination of real and fake imagery, with at least one photo of a woman wearing such a shirt looking legitimate, Farid said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from Swift about the post by Trump, who separately shared on Truth Social a video of a supporter voicing the dubious claim that "Swifties were rallying for Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's soaring popularity and sway over her fans could make her support valuable in the upcoming presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Republicans and Democrats have long wanted to count on her support, but the megastar has been largely reticent about her political leanings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a demonstration of her star power, when Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote last fall, directing them to the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org, her plea had an immediate impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following her message, the institution said it recorded more than 35,000 new registrations, 23 percent more than last year and the most since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's feelers into politics have been heavily scrutinised, making her a ripe target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her reserve led many critics to speculate Swift was a closet Republican, until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right US Senator Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since spoken out in particular for the legal right to an abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent weeks, intense speculation has swirled on social media that Swift will endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The megastar has not commented publicly, but that has not stopped legions of fans to form a group called "Swifties for Kamala," attracting tens of thousands of followers on platforms such as Instagram and X, formerly Twitter. (AFP)

    City of Pokrovsk evacuated as Kremlin rules out talks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday ruled out entering peace talks with Ukraine over Kyiv's surprise offensive into Russian territory, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said was meeting its goals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine sent troops over the border on August 6 and has since held onto a part of the western Kursk region, in the biggest attack on Russian soil since Moscow attacked in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move has rattled Moscow and taken Ukraine's Western allies by surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has said the offensive is aimed at stretching Russian forces, creating a "buffer zone" and bringing the conflict "closer" to an end on "fair" terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said on Monday that it had pushed the prospect of peace talks further away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the current stage, given this escapade, we will not talk."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called entering a negotiating process "completely inappropriate" and said future talks "depend on the situation on the battlefield, including in the Kursk region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow, intent on not letting the offensive affect its own advance in eastern Ukraine, claimed another village in the war-battered Donetsk region on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bracing for a further assault, Ukraine ordered the evacuation of families from the key city of Pokrovsk as Moscow's forces inched closer to the logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, meanwhile, said his troops in Kursk – who have set up administrative offices and published previously unthinkable footage of Ukrainian soldiers patrolling Russian streets – are meeting their targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are achieving our goals. This morning we have another replenishment of the (prisoner of war) exchange fund for our country," Zelensky said, referring to more Russian troops being taken prisoner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Zelensky said the push into Russian territory was designed to create a "buffer zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prospect of peace talks appeared distant even before Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin had demanded Ukraine cede swathes of territory if it wanted a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, who has ruled out direct talks with the Kremlin, demands Russia's full withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and reparations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, Ukraine has destroyed two key bridges over the Seym river inside Russia, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes to the combat zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bridge over the river was hit over the weekend, a Russian military investigator said in a video published by high-profile pro-Kremlin TV commentator Vladimir Solovyev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on the bridges have left Russia with limited options, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's defence ministry said on Monday Russia had thwarted Ukrainian attacks on three more villages in the Kursk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has also been accused of sending inexperienced conscripts to protect the Kursk region, unwilling to redeploy experienced fighters from the frontlines in eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incursion has visibly worried Russians, prompting some in Kyiv to hope that sentiment could turn the country against the Kremlin's more than two-year war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accustomed to seeing the war as a television show, Russians are now seeing it up close and personal," Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you don't want to see the war, you have to end the war by forcing your 'leadership' to make peace on fair terms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, Moscow said it captured the town of Artemovo, which is called Zalizne in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zalizne had a population of around 5,000 at the start of 2022 – making it one of the largest places captured by Russian troops in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine also said Russian attacks killed four people in frontline towns on Monday, with a 71-year-old woman killed in her garden in Toretsk and three civilians in their 60s and 70s killed in the village of Zarichne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the front moved further west towards the city of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian officials announced the compulsory evacuation of families with children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are starting the forced evacuation of families with children from the Pokrovsk community," Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin said, ordering the "compulsory" evacuation of children and their parents from Pokrovsk and about a dozen surrounding villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said more than 53,000 people live in the area, including almost 4,000 children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Filashkin called the decision to evacuate "necessary and inevitable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has long tried to capture Pokrovsk, which lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Phil Donahue, a pioneering US talk show host, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Donahue's death in Manhattan on Sunday following a long illness was announced on NBC's Today Show, where he made frequent appearances from 1979 to 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Phil Donahue Show," launched in 1967, was the first on daytime US television to feature audience participation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It remained popular through the 1970s and into the 1980s, earning Donahue numerous Emmy Awards, and the format was adopted by future talk show hosts such as Oprah Winfrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Donahue show was also notable for bringing conversations about controversial issues such as abortion, religion and sex to daytime television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Joe Biden in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He pioneered the live daytime talk show, holding a mirror up to America," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He interviewed everyone from our greatest stars to our forgotten neighbours, uniting us around the toughest issues of our time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue was married for 44 years to actress Marlo Thomas, the star of the 1960s sitcom "That Girl." (AFP)

    Blinken meets Israeli leaders at 'decisive moment'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken on Monday urged Israel and Hamas not to derail negotiations that he said may be a "last opportunity" to secure a Gaza truce and hostage release deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, on his ninth visit to the Middle East since Hamas's October 7 attack triggered the war, said he was back in Israel "to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a decisive moment – probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US secretary of state later met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, and is due to travel on Tuesday to Egypt where ceasefire talks are expected to resume this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for delays in reaching a truce accord that diplomats say could help avert a wider conflagration in the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places, and to greater intensity," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is time for it to get done. It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Months of on-off negotiations with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have failed to produce an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of talks in Qatar last week, Hamas called on mediators to implement a framework outlined in late May by US President Joe Biden, rather than hold more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said on Sunday that a ceasefire was "still possible" and that the United States was "not giving up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Sunday, hours after Blinken had landed in the city, there was a bombing in Tel Aviv that was later claimed by the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One person – the bomber according to Israeli media – was killed and another wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The groups threatened to carry out more such attacks in Israel "as long as the occupation's massacres, the displacement of civilians and the policy of assassinations continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the bombing could have been more serious but the assailant detonated the explosives before managing to reach a more heavily populated area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as Israel and Hamas traded blame for delays in reaching a truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Qatar meeting last week, the United States submitted what mediators called a "bridging proposal," which Hamas on Sunday said "responds to Netanyahu's conditions" and includes terms that the Palestinian group would not accept.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas insisted on "a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip," saying Netanyahu wanted to keep Israeli forces at several strategic locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators," the Palestinian movement said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order for an agreement to be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday Netanyahu said that Hamas "remains obstinate" and must be pressured, a day after his office said Israeli negotiators had expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators also reported progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to the prime minister's governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 40,139 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan announced by Biden at the end of May would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks while Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence raged on in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, an Israeli soldier and two Hezbollah fighters were killed in cross-border clashes, the Israeli military and the Lebanese militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In southern Gaza, a medical source said three people were killed in Abassan village and witnesses reported Israeli air strikes near the Islamic University in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops were operating in southern and central Gaza, and that the air force "struck over 45 terrorist targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It later said that it had "expanded" operations in Khan Younis and the outskirts of Deir el-Balah. A medical source said a baby girl was killed and several women wounded in air strikes west of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighting has devastated Gaza. A video posted to social media by a UN official showed a convoy passing scenes of utter destruction with almost every building reduced to rubble and the few still standing badly damaged. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least one person was killed and six people were missing after a luxury yacht was struck by a whirlwind and sank off the coast of the Sicilian capital Palermo, Italian media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "One body was located in the wreck but not yet recovered, at a depth of around 50 metres," a coast guard spokesman told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's fire brigade and coast guard had earlier said divers were searching for seven missing people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 56-metre-long luxury sailboat, which was British registered, sank with 22 people on board when it was hit by a violent storm at sunrise, the coast guard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said one crew member and six passengers were missing, adding they were of British, American and Canadian nationality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight of those rescued, including a one-year-old child, were transferred to local hospitals and were all in a stable condition, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coast guard named the yacht as the "Bayesian", which was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The luxury ship has an aluminium hull, can reach a maximum speed of 15 knots and can carry 12 guests and a crew of up to 10, according to specialist online yacht sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boat left the Sicilian port of Milazzo on August 14 and was last tracked east of Palermo on Sunday evening, with a navigation status of "at anchor", according to vessel tracking app Vesselfinder. (Agencies)

 French movie star Alain Delon, who died Sunday aged 88, said that in Japan he was like a deity. It wasn't an exaggeration, local fans told AFP on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In Japan I am a kind of a god," Delon told Figaro Magazine in 1986 on one of his many visits to Japan, when women fainted and crowds chased his limousine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People get real pleasure from touching me, caressing my hand, kissing my fingers," he told the magazine, reporting on fans showering him with gifts from red roses to statuettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's breakthrough role in Japan was "Purple Noon" (1960) as the handsome, homicidal anti-hero for the original screen version of Patricia Highsmith's thriller "The Talented Mr Ripley".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon played an "ambitious roughneck who loved money, women, and was ready for anything," said Sahoko Hata, a film critic who worked in the Japanese movie industry at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This thirst symbolised that of Japanese youth at the time," Hata told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon made the first of many visits to Japan in 1963 to promote his films, but also increasingly to appear in television variety shows and at society events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His TV appearances frequently broke audience records and up until the mid-1970s he regularly topped rankings of the Japan's most popular celebrities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My friends in their 70s and 80s are still all madly in love with him. Even at 88, he looked great," Delon fan Seta, 74, told AFP on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I used to think to myself: 'How is it possible for such an attractive person to exist in this world?'," the pensioner said in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was handsome, elegant and slightly mysterious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Kaoru Fujita, a woman in her late 50s shopping in Tokyo with her daughter, Delon's name was "synonymous with 'the handsome man'."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I have to think of someone to compare him with, I would say George Clooney or Brad Pitt," she told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't think there is anyone who is as so classically handsome as he was. As an actor he was one of a kind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon gradually transformed himself into a sort of ambassador of French chic, becoming the face of Japanese fashion brand D'Urban and appearing in adverts for Mazda cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Alain Delon" brand was launched in 1978, mainly aimed at Japan and other Asian countries, selling accessories from watches and socks to cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1980s and 1990s, a Japanese tour operator even offered organised trips to Europe that featured a banquet in Paris in the presence of Delon himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extra paid options included having the honour of presenting Delon with a bouquet or having a souvenir photo taken with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon had a "dark, sad, mysterious, ambitious side, but also a bit of a loser", Yoshi Yatabe, a former programmer of the Tokyo International Film Festival, told AFP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This dark side really appealed to Japanese viewers who tend to like losers. In kabuki theatre, for example, the audience sympathises with the weakest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "France and Europe were a very far away place for me, so I would always wonder where he came from," remembered pensioner Mikiko Tsuburaya, 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was still a child, not a grown up yet (when he was popular). I would look at him as someone living in another world," the pensioner said. (AFP)

    President Xi Jinping meets Vietnam's leader in Beijing

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping hosted Vietnam's new top leader To Lam in Beijing on Monday, in Lam's first overseas trip since being named general secretary of the country's Communist Party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi welcomed Lam with a military parade outside the Great Hall of the People, before the pair held talks and signed cooperation documents inside the state building off Tiananmen Square.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the two ruling communist parties in the world today, China and Vietnam should uphold the original spirit of friendship, continue the traditional friendship...and continue to deepen the strategically important Sino-Vietnamese shared community of destiny," Xi told Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congratulating Lam, Xi said if the two countries adhered to a "common endeavour of promoting the cause of world socialism, we believe that our road will be wider and wider."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said Xi had guided China to become a "strong and prosperous country", and lauded him for developing Beijing's "role towards peace, cooperation and development in the region and the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was formally named Vietnam's leader earlier this month, pledging to "speed up" a sweeping anti-graft campaign that has snared thousands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ascension came two weeks after the death of Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades, who presided over the so-called "blazing furnace" crackdown on corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam had already assumed the largely ceremonial role of president in May after his predecessor resigned in the face of the vast anti-graft purge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But now as the Communist Party of Vietnam's general secretary, Lam is the most powerful figure in the country's leadership structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His three-day trip to China has already taken him to Guangzhou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last December, China and Vietnam pledged to deepen bilateral ties when Xi visited the country, his first time there in six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That trip came after Vietnam and the United States upgraded diplomatic ties during US President Joe Biden's visit in September 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam has long pursued a "bamboo diplomacy" approach, striving to stay on good terms with both China and the United States. (AFP)

    Tokyo shrine vandalised again: Japan authorities

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Japanese authorities said the Yasukuni Shrine had been vandalised again on Monday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766739_1_20240819130118.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tokyo shrine seen as a symbol of Japan's past militarism on Monday reported a second case of graffiti in three months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo honours 2.5 million mostly Japanese killed in wars since the late 19th century, including convicted war criminals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials regularly pay homage at Yasukuni, as did three government ministers and scores of other lawmakers on the 79th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such visits have angered some of Japan's Asian neighbours and former victims of its imperialism, especially China and South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Yasukuni shrine official confirmed the new case of graffiti to reporters, without elaborating further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late May, a Chinese man allegedly conspired with two others to spray-paint the word "toilet" in red on a pillar at the shrine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jiang Zhuojun, 29, who lived north of Tokyo, was later arrested "on suspicion of vandalism and disrespect for a place of worship", Tokyo police said in July. (AFP)
