<div class="itemFullText">
 More than a dozen Republicans called on US President Joe Biden to step down on Sunday after he ended his re-election bid, saying that his unwillingness to continue to campaign raises questions about his ability to continue to govern.
 <br>
  <br/>
  House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, US Senator JD Vance – the just-nominated running mate of Donald Trump in the November 5 election – and other lawmakers urged the 81-year-old incumbent to step down from office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden insisted in his statement that he would finish his term, which ends January 20, 2025, and fellow Democrats blasted the calls as "ridiculous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Joe Biden is not fit to run for president, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough," said Johnson, who is next in line to the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's fellow Democrats for weeks had called on him to end his campaign after a disastrous June 27 debate against former President Trump in which Biden at times struggled to finish his thoughts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?" Vance tweeted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, including Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin, called on Biden's Cabinet to remove him from office by invoking the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution. Biden's Cabinet, composed of officials hand-picked by the president, is highly unlikely to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the resignation calls, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close associate of Biden, said, "I think that is ridiculous." (Reuters)

    Democrats rally behind VP Harris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kamala Harris hopes to make history as the first Black woman to be US president. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762584_1_20240722052554.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Many Democrats on Sunday quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris to run as the party's presidential nominee against Donald Trump after incumbent President Joe Biden's abrupt departure from the race, but some powerful party members, including former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, stayed quiet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After weeks of in-party fighting between Democrats on whether Biden, 81, should stay in the race, a rush of support coalescing behind her is crucial just over 100 days before November's election. However, there are plenty of doubts inside the Democratic Party about whether Harris can beat Trump in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden himself endorsed Harris on Sunday, not in his initial letter stepping down, but in a separate statement. He was quickly followed by the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, several key donors, lawmakers including US Senator Patty Murray, and super PACs including Priorities USA and Unite the Country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year," Biden said on social media platform X. "Democrats – it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder and a major Democratic donor, called Harris "the American dream personified," noting she was the daughter of immigrants. "She is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, others including Pelosi thanked Biden for his patriotism but did not yet throw their support behind Harris or any other candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Senator Peter Welch, the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to drop his re-election run, called for an open process to nominate Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democrats should have “an open process so that whoever our nominee is, including Kamala, has the strength of having a process that shows the consensus position of the party,” he said. “The debate in the Democratic Party is who can carry on the legacy of President Biden and defeat Trump.” (Reuters)

    Biden quits re-election bid, backs VP Harris

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden will not seek re-election. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762576_1_20240722015536.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday after fellow Democrats lost faith in his mental acuity and ability to beat Donald Trump while endorsing Vice President Kamal Harris to replace him as the party's candidate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, in a post on X, said he will remain in his role as president and commander-in-chief until his term ends in January 2025 and will address the nation this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term," Biden wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His initial statement had not included an endorsement of Harris, but he followed up a few minutes later with an expression of support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman to do run at the top of a major-party ticket in the country's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear whether other senior Democrats would challenge Harris for the party's nomination – she was widely seen as the pick for many party officials – or whether the party itself would choose to open the field for nominations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's announcement follows a wave of public and private pressure from Democratic lawmakers and party officials to quit the race after his shockingly poor performance in a June 27 televised debate last month against Republican rival Trump, 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's failure at times to complete clear sentences took the public spotlight away from Trump's performance, in which he made a string of false statements, and trained it instead on questions surrounding Biden's fitness for another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's historic move – the first sitting president to give up his party's nomination for reelection since President Lyndon Johnson in March 1968 – leaves his replacement with less than four months to wage a campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Harris emerges as the nominee, the move would represent an unprecedented gamble by the Democratic Party: its first Black and Asian American woman to run for the White House in a country that has elected one Black president and never a woman president in more than two centuries of democracy.

    Paris rejects 4,000 Games accreditation requests

<div class="itemFullText">
 French security services rejected more than 4,000 applications for Paris 2024 Olympics accreditations, including over espionage and cyberattack concerns, the country's caretaker interior minister said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gerald Darmanin said French authorities have so far checked close to one million accreditation requests for the Games that kick off on July 26 and had rejected 4,340 people, some over radical Islamist connections or suspicion of being foreign spies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Close to one hundred were rejected over espionage fears or concerns they were agents trying to get an accreditation using a different profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are probably not there to carry out attacks. But in addition to intelligence and traditional espionage, there is the possibility of accessing entry points into computer networks to carry out a cyberattack," Darmanin told the weekly Journal du Dimanche.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they had applied as journalists or technical staff and their countries of origin were Russia and Belarus, among others, which he did not name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we refused a large number of 'journalists' who claimed to cover the Games. On the other hand, we accepted the presence of Russians who work for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We apply the precautionary principle," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian journalists have been allowed to get accredited for the Games and have already arrived in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris will be deploying 45,000 security personnel to guarantee the safety of the Games and its unique opening ceremony along the river Seine where athletes will float on barges past hundreds of thousands of spectators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers have reduced the initial number of spectators from 600,000 to around 300,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To our knowledge, we have no known threat to the security of the Olympic Games," Darmanin said. "In the past days I did a new reconnaissance by boat on the Seine with the police. I confirm that the ceremony will take place in the format announced by the President of the Republic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the flow of the river and the low risk of bad weather, there is – to date – no identified threat to the Games. Neither our intelligence services nor the foreign services with which we coordinate have detected any foreign threat. But you have to stay very humble and focused." (Reuters)

    Bangladesh scraps most job quotas that sparked riots

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bangladesh's top court scales back job quotas that triggered days of deadly unrest. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762546_1_20240721170912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladesh’s top court on Sunday scaled back a controversial quota system for government job applicants after it led to nationwide unrest and deadly clashes between police and protesters that killed scores of people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court in its verdict ordered 93 percent of government jobs to be allocated on a merit-based system, leaving the remaining seven percent for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971 and other categories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the system reserved 30 percent of such jobs for the relatives of war veterans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunday's verdict comes after weeks of demonstrations — mostly led by students — that turned deadly on Tuesday after protesters began clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the week, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and hurled smoke grenades to scatter stone-throwing protesters who filled the streets and university campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sporadic clashes in some parts of Dhaka, the capital, were reported on Saturday but it was not immediately clear whether there were any fatalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladeshi authorities haven’t shared any official numbers of those killed and injured, but the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reported Saturday that at least 103 people have died so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the court's hearing, soldiers patrolled cities across the South Asian country, while a nationwide curfew and an internet blackout remained in force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the curfew will be relaxed from 3 pm to 5 pm on Sunday for people to run essential errands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government has declared Sunday and Monday as public holidays, with only emergency services allowed to operate. (AP)

    Trump holds first rally since assassination attempt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US presidential candidate Donald Trump, holding his first campaign rally since surviving an assassination attempt a week ago, rejected concerns he was a threat to America's democratic system, telling the crowd: "I took a bullet for democracy."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I'm not an extremist at all," the newly-crowned Republican presidential nominee continued at the rally in swing state Michigan, dismissing his reported links to Project 2025, a manifesto from the Heritage Foundation that has been characterised by opponents as an authoritarian, right-wing wish list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he mocked the rival Democratic Party, roiled by unprecedented pressure for US President Joe Biden to abandon his re-election bid, amid concerns over his age and fitness to serve, if re-elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have no idea who their candidate is...this guy [Biden] goes and he gets the votes, and now they want to take it away. That's democracy," Trump told the 12,000-strong crowd of supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fiery, but typically rambling speech, the Republican riffed on his hardline immigration views, espoused falsehoods about migrant crime, and repeated his baseless claim that Democrats "rigged" the 2020 election. (AFP)

    N Korea resumes trash balloon flights: S Korea

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korea says North Korea has resumed sending balloons carrying trash across the border into the South. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762522_1_20240721115803.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean officials said North Korea launched more balloons likely carrying trash towards the South on Sunday, days after Seoul restarted blaring anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts across the border in retaliation for the North’s repeated balloon campaigns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Cold War-style psychological battle between the two Koreas is adding to tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the rivals threatening stronger steps against each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North Korean balloons were flying north of Seoul, the South Korean capital, after crossing the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the public should be alert for falling objects and report to police and military authorities if they see any balloons on the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea’s latest balloon-flying is the ninth of its kind since late May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has floated more than 2,000 balloons to drop waste paper, scraps of cloth, cigarette butts, waste batteries and even manure on South Korea, though they have so far caused no major damage in South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has said the balloons were launched in response to South Korean activists sending political leaflets to the North via their own balloons. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Planes were gradually taking off again on Saturday after global airlines, banks and media were thrown into turmoil by one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Airport Authority said most systems are operating normally again, but contingency plans remain in place, and mainland state media said Beijing's airports had not been affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passenger crowds had swelled at airports on Friday as dozens of flights were cancelled after an update to a programme operating on Microsoft Windows crashed systems worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday, officials said the situation had returned virtually to normal in airports across Germany and France, as Paris prepared to welcome millions for the Olympic Games starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple US airlines and airports across Asia said they had resumed operations, with check-in services restored in Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand, and mostly back to normal in India, Indonesia and at Singapore's Changi Airport as of Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft estimated Saturday that 8.5 million Windows devices were affected in the global IT crash, adding that the number amounted to less than one percent of all Windows machines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services", it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft said the issue began at 1900 GMT on Thursday, affecting Windows users running the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Saturday blog post, CrowdStrike said it had released an update on Thursday night that had caused a system crash and the infamous "blue screen of death" fatal error message.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said it had rolled out a fix for the problem, and the company's boss, George Kurtz, told US news channel CNBC he wanted to "personally apologise to every organisation, every group and every person who has been impacted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company also said it could take a few days for things to fully get back to normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's National Health Service was hobbled by the crash on Friday, preventing doctors from accessing patient records and booking appointments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "majority of systems... are now coming back online in most areas, however they are still running slightly slower than usual", an NHS spokesperson said, warning of disruption continuing into next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media companies were also hit, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its Friday morning news broadcasts. Australia's ABC also reported major difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian, British and German authorities warned of an increase in scam and phishing attempts following the outage, including people offering to help reboot computers and asking for personal information or credit card details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks in Kenya and Ukraine reported issues with their digital services, some mobile phone carriers were disrupted and customer services in a number of companies went down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of this outage is unprecedented, and will no doubt go down in history," said Junade Ali of Britain's Institution of Engineering and Technology, adding that the last incident approaching the same scale was in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While some airports halted all flights, in others airline staff resorted to manual check-ins for passengers, leading to long lines and frustrated travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of US flights were grounded, although airlines later said they were re-establishing their services and working through the backlog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior US administration official said Friday that "our understanding is that flight operations have resumed across the country, although some congestion remains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's largest airline Indigo said Saturday that operations had been "resolved", adding in a statement on X that the process of resuming normal operations would "extend into the weekend".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Low-cost carrier AirAsia said it was still trying to get back online and had been "working around the clock towards recovering its departure control systems".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said the issue was "not the result of or related to a cyberattack". (AFP)

    Yemen's Houthi rebels say Israeli strikes hit Hodeida

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli warplanes struck the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida on Saturday, a day after a Houthi drone attack killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, the rebels said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement on social media, top Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam reported a "brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Axios news outlet cited US and Israeli officials as saying that Israel carried out the strikes in retaliation for a Houthi drone strike on Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi attack on Friday penetrated Israel's vaunted air defences and killed a civilian in a Tel Aviv apartment building, drawing Israeli threats of retaliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi-run health ministry said there were deaths and injuries in the Hodeida strikes but it did not give a toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement carried by the Houthi-run Al Masirah television, it said several people suffered "serious burns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage aired by Al Masirah, which has not been independently verified, showed a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness in Hodeida reported hearing several large explosions and seeing smoke over the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel pumps across the city closed following the attack, the correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hodeida has been hard hit by a series of strikes carried out by Britain and the United States since January in response to attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis have attacked at least 88 commercial vessels since November in a campaign they say targets Israeli-linked shipping in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza war. (AFP)

    Bangladesh army on streets as police shoot protesters

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Soldiers were patrolling Bangladeshi cities on Saturday to quell growing civil unrest sparked by student demonstrations, with riot police firing on protesters who defied a government curfew.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's violence has killed at least 123 people so far, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, and poses a monumental challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government curfew went into effect at midnight and the premier's office asked the military to deploy troops after police again failed to subdue widespread mayhem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The army has been deployed nationwide to control the law and order situation," said armed forces spokesman Shahdat Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The curfew will remain in effect until at least 10:00 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday, private broadcaster Channel 24 reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Streets in the capital Dhaka were almost deserted at daybreak, with troops on foot and in armoured personnel carriers patrolling the sprawling megacity of 20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But thousands returned to the streets later in the day in the residential neighbourhood of Rampura, with police firing at the crowd and wounding at least one person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our backs are to the wall," protester Nazrul Islam, 52, said at the scene. "There's anarchy going on in the country... They are shooting at people like birds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals have reported a growing number of gunshot deaths since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hundreds of thousands of people" had battled police across the capital on Friday, said police spokesman Faruk Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At least 150 police officers were admitted to hospital. Another 150 were given first aid treatment," he said, adding that two officers had been beaten to death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The protesters torched many police booths... Many government offices were torched and vandalised."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said that another two police officers were killed on Saturday, while four people admitted to intensive care succumbed to their injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more protesters were killed in the industrial town of Savar on Dhaka's outskirts, a major centre of Bangladesh's garment exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enam Medical College Hospital spokesman Zahidur Rahman confirmed the latter deaths, adding that "nine people came here with bullet wounds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for Students Against Discrimination, the main group organising the protests, said that two of its leaders had been arrested since Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a planned diplomatic tour but abandoned her plans after a week of escalating violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She has cancelled her Spain and Brazil tours due to the prevailing situation," said her press secretary Nayeemul Islam Khan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have called for an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the scheme benefits families loyal to Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the first deaths on Tuesday, protesters have begun demanding Hasina leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not about the rights of the students anymore," said business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, at the scene of the Rampura protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are here as the general public now," he added. "Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pierre Prakash of Crisis Group said the lack of competitive elections since Hasina took office had led to mounting public frustration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With no real alternative at the ballot box, discontented Bangladeshis have few options besides street protests to make their voices heard," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rising death toll is a shocking indictment of the absolute intolerance shown by the Bangladeshi authorities to protest and dissent," Babu Ram Pant of Amnesty International said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities imposed a nationwide internet shutdown on Thursday that remains in effect, severely hampering communication in and out of Bangladesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government websites remain offline and major newspapers including the Dhaka Tribune and Daily Star have been unable to update their social media platforms since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh Television, the state broadcaster, also remains offline after its Dhaka headquarters was set on fire by protesters the same day. (AFP)

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762403_1_20240720091646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations' highest court said on Friday that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible, in its strongest findings to date on the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advisory opinion by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, was not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law," President Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said Israel's obligations include paying restitution for harm and "the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a swift reaction, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the opinion as "fundamentally wrong" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICJ opinion also found that the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor "render aid or assistance" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the occupied territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called the opinion "historic" and urged states to adhere to it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade...no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation," Palestinian envoy Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague. (Reuters)

    Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong dies aged 80
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1762370-20240720.htm

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In power since 2011, Trong had enjoyed remarkable longevity in office. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762370_1_20240719235331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong died on Friday aged 80 "after a period of illness," the ruling Communist Party said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came a day after the party that Trong led said he would hand over power to focus on receiving medical treatment for an undisclosed medical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, state media announced Trong had passed away in the afternoon at a military hospital "due to old age and serious illness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be a special statement on the organisation of the funeral at the national level," state media added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trong's responsibilities have been handed to the country's largely ceremonial president, To Lam, a powerful former public security minister long seen as jockeying for the top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Politburo calls on the entire party, people and army to have absolute trust in the party's leadership and state management," it said on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's communist regime, which is in the midst of a complete overhaul, has undergone a series of upheavals in recent months, with ministers, business leaders and two presidents all falling from grace as part of a vast anti-corruption campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was voted in as president in May by Vietnam's rubber-stamp parliament after his predecessor was forced to resign as part of the anti-graft drive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said at the time that Lam, who was deputy head of the steering committee on anti-corruption matters, had weaponised investigations to take down his political rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Headed by the party general secretary, Vietnam's leadership structure gives the president the second-most authority, and also includes the prime minister and the head of the National Assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trong's poor health had fuelled widespread speculation that he would not be able to stay in power until the 2026 party congress, which is expected to appoint a successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In power since 2011, Trong enjoyed remarkable longevity in office, during a mandate that rights groups say has coincided with increasing authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known for being a technocrat and on good terms with Beijing, he structured the party around himself, benefiting from a decade of economic growth that strengthened his legitimacy. (AFP)

    Russia jails US reporter Gershkovich for 16 years

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Evan Gershkovich has spent almost 16 months in detention on charges the US government and his employer believe are fabricated. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762368_1_20240719233856.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US reporter Evan Gershkovich was sentenced by a Russian court on Friday to 16 years prison for "espionage", a verdict reached after just over three weeks of secretive court proceedings denounced by Washington as a sham.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia has a policy of not exchanging prisoners internationally unless they have already been convicted, potentially paving the way for the 32-year-old to be swapped in a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was sentenced to "punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of 16 years in a strict regime colony," Judge Andrei Mineyev said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich did not appear to react to the sentencing, standing in a glass defendants' cage in dark trousers and a T-shirt. He waved to his journalist colleagues as he was led away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Wall Street Journal correspondent, who pleaded not guilty, became the first journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Cold War when he was detained in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has spent almost 16 months in detention on charges the United States government and his employer believe are fabricated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist," the Journal's publisher Almar Latour and editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Press rights group Reporters Without Borders slammed the sentencing as "outrageous" and called for Gershkovich to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington believes he is being held as a bargaining chip to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His trial has moved rapidly since the first hearing in late June, with the prosecution and defence teams giving their final arguments on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other similar cases in Russia have dragged on far more slowly, with several weeks or even months between hearings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked on Friday, the Kremlin refused to be drawn into speculation about the prospect of a prisoner swap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin has provided no public evidence for the spying allegations against Gershkovich, saying only that he was caught "red-handed" spying on a tank factory in the Urals region and was working for the CIA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said on Friday that Gershkovich acted with "careful measures of secrecy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions are running extremely high between the countries over Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow and Washington have both said they are open to exchanging the reporter in a deal, but neither has given clues on when that might happen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that talks between US and Russian special services over possible prisoner exchanges were ongoing, without naming any specific individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has implied he wants to see the release of Vadim Krasikov, a Russian convicted in Germany of killing a Chechen separatist commander. German judges said it was an assassination orchestrated by Russian authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other US nationals detained in Russia are reporter Alsu Kurmasheva and ballerina Ksenia Karelina, who are both dual US-Russian citizens, and former US marine Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for spying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US-born son of Soviet emigres raised in New Jersey, Gershkovich had reported from Russia since 2017, still returning for reporting trips following Russia's Ukraine offensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Moscow's isolated Lefortovo prison, he communicated with friends and family in hand-written letters that revealed he had not lost hope about his situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At his first trial hearing on June 26, he spoke briefly to greet journalists and appeared smiling and cheerful, while revealing that his head had been fully shaved, as it was on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A United Nations working group this month stated that Gershkovich's detention on spying charges was "arbitrary" and called for his immediate release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Evan has never been employed by the United States government. Evan is not a spy," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has warned US citizens still in Russia to "depart immediately" due to the risk of wrongful arrest. (AFP)

    Airports, broadcasters worldwide hit by tech outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A global tech outage was disrupting operations in multiple industries on Friday, with airlines halting flights, some broadcasters off-air and everything from banking to healthcare hit by system problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United Airlines and Allegiant Air grounded flights citing communication problems. The order came shortly after Microsoft said it resolved its cloud services outage that impacted several low-cost carriers, though it was not immediately clear whether those were related.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A third party software outage is impacting computer systems worldwide, including at United. While we work to restore those systems, we are holding all aircraft at their departure airports," United said in a statement. "Flights already airborne are continuing to their destinations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's government said outages suffered by media, banks and telecoms companies there appeared to be linked to an issue at global cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to an alert sent by Crowdstrike to its clients, the company’s “Falcon Sensor” software is causing Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the “Blue Screen of Death”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alert, which was sent at 05.30GMT on Friday, also shared a manual workaround to rectify the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Crowdstrike spokesperson did not respond to emails or calls requesting comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no information to suggest the outage was a cyber security incident, the office of Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness said in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outages rippled far and wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The travel industry was among the hardest hit with airports around the world, including Tokyo, Amsterdam, Berlin and several Spanish airports reporting problems with their systems and delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International airlines, including Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned of problems with their booking systems and other disruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Britain, booking systems used by doctors were offline, multiple reports from medical officials on X said, while Sky News, one of the country's major news broadcasters was off air, apologising for being unable to transmit live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks and other financial institutions from Australia to India and South Africa warned clients about disruptions to their services, while LSEG Group reported an outage of its data and news platform Workspace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon's AWS cloud service provider said in a statement that it was "investigating reports of connectivity issues to Windows EC2 instances and Workspaces within AWS."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear whether all reported outages were linked to Crowdstrike problems or there were other issues at play. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump, sombre and bandaged, accepted the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday at the Republican National Convention in a speech that described in detail the assassination attempt that could have ended his life just five days earlier before laying out a sweeping populist agenda, particularly on immigration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 78-year-old former US president, known best for his bombast and aggressive rhetoric, began his acceptance speech with a softer and deeply personal message that drew directly from his brush with death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moment by moment, the crowd listening in silence, Trump described standing onstage in Butler, Pennsylvania, with his head turned to look at a chart on display when he felt something hit his ear. He raised his hand to his head and saw immediately that it was covered in blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin’s bullet would have perfectly hit its mark,” Trump said. “And I would not be here tonight. We would not be together.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump’s address, the longest convention speech in modern history at just under 93 minutes, marked the climax and conclusion of a massive four-day Republican pep rally that drew thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to swing-state Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensing political opportunity in the wake of his near-death experience, the often bombastic Republican leader embraced a new tone he hopes will help generate even more momentum in an election that appears to be shifting in his favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart,” Trump said, wearing a large white bandage on his right ear, as he has all week, to cover a wound he sustained in the Saturday shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While he spoke in a gentler tone than at his usual rallies, Trump also outlined an agenda led by what he promises would be the largest deportation operation in US history. He repeatedly accused people crossing the US-Mexico border illegally of staging an “invasion.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, he teased new tariffs on trade and an “America first” foreign policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also falsely suggested Democrats had cheated during the 2020 election he lost, despite a raft of federal and state investigations proving there was no systemic fraud, and suggested “we must not criminalise dissent or demonise political disagreement” even as he has long called for prosecutions of his opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not mention abortion rights, an issue that has bedeviled Republicans ever since the US Supreme Court struck down a federally guaranteed right to abortion two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump nominated three of the six justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump at his rallies often takes credit for Roe being overturned and argues states should have the right to institute their own abortion laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nor did he mention the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in which Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has long referred to the people jailed for the riot as “hostages.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indeed, Trump barely mentioned Biden, often referring only to the “current administration.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was Donald Trump who destroyed our economy, ripped away rights, and failed middle class families,” said Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair, in a statement after the speech. “Now he pursues the presidency with an even more extreme vision for where he wants to take this country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention ends at an uncertain moment in the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With less than four months to go in the contest, major changes in the race are possible, if not likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's appearance came as Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, clings to his party’s presumptive nomination in the face of unrelenting pressure from key congressional allies, donors and even former President Barack Obama, who fear he may be unable to win reelection after his disastrous debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long pressed by allies to campaign more vigorously, Biden is instead in isolation at his beach home in Delaware after having been diagnosed with Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention has showcased a Republican Party reshaped by Trump since he shocked the GOP establishment and won over the party’s grassroots on his way to the party’s 2016 nomination. Rivals Trump has vanquished – including senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis – put aside their past criticisms and gave him their unqualified support.

    Trump to rally unified Republicans in grand finale

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump arrived at the convention looking emotional and with a bandaged ear. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762205_1_20240719052225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump will get a hero's welcome on Thursday as he accepts the Republican Party's nomination to run for US president in a speech capping a convention dominated by the recent attempt on his life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 78-year-old will address the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin hoping to build momentum toward victory over President Joe Biden in the November election and a second term in the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supporters have been lining up all week to applaud the former president for his bravery since Saturday's assassination bid by a gunman at a Pennsylvania rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As some of his loyalists blamed Democrats' rhetoric for the attack, Trump said he had torn up a more aggressive version of his keynote address in favour of one to "unite our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just grateful we're going to hear from him. It's a miracle that his life was spared, and I really believe it was God's hand," said Teena Horlacher, a 50-year-old convention delegate from Utah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd love for him to talk about Saturday, what his feelings were."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has a 90-minute speaking slot, from 9:00 to 10:30 pm (0100 to 0230 GMT on Friday), according to a source familiar with the schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also set to address the convention are the world-famous retired professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, and longtime friend Dana White who is chief executive of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has attended multiple UFC bouts as he seeks to cultivate his image as an alpha-male stereotype and lock in younger male votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The schedule notably shows no speaking slot for former first lady Melania Trump, a clear break from tradition at modern-era US nominating conventions, where spouses have almost always taken the stage in bids to personalise the candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has seen his poll lead expand since Biden's dismal debate performance last month threw his party into chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican campaign has even been talking up Trump's chances in Democratic strongholds like Minnesota and Virginia, potentially forcing Biden funds and manpower away from defending his "blue wall" in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's keynote address on Thursday will be followed on television and online by millions, closing the convention by promising what his team calls "a new golden age for America."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It brings down the curtain on four days of speeches from elected officials, entertainers, industry figures and everyday Americans who mixed with some 50,000 Republicans attending the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gathering opened on Monday with a vote to confirm Trump as the party's nominee after he won almost every state's primary contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been the first convention over which Trump has had total control, after a 2016 edition hampered by party divisions and a second appearance in 2020 reined in by the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The schedule was designed around his image, with themes for each day playing on his "Make America Great Again" rallying cry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump set the tone when he walked slowly into the Fiserv Forum arena on the opening day – looking emotional and with a bandaged ear, just two days after the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The week also saw Trump name right-wing Senator JD Vance as his running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old author of "Hillbilly Elegy," a best-selling memoir about growing up poor in working-class America, is a one-time critic who has become one of Trump's most staunch backers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump himself was a diminished figure after his 2020 election loss and a subsequent riot at the US Capitol by his supporters, but he has spent much of the last four years reshaping Republican politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Installing close allies, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump on the Republican National Committee, the mercurial tycoon has effectively crushed dissent within the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is increasingly confident of victory – despite multiple legal problems and two impeachments clouding his first term – as Biden is reeling from weak polls and concerns over his health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 81, Biden has been facing growing calls from his own side to quit the race, and he suffered another blow on Wednesday when he was diagnosed with Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's a clearly stark contrast between the strength of President Trump and the weakness of President Biden," said Mississippi delegate Clifton Carroll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And I think he'll expand on that, and really send a message that the entire United States of America can get behind whether they're Republican, Democrat or Independent." (AFP)

    Biden, Netanyahu due to meet next week: White House

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden is still expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visits Washington next week but it will depend on his recovery from Covid, the White House said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We have every expectation that the two leaders will have a chance to see each other while prime minister Netanyahu is in town" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu is set to address the US Congress on Wednesday and Israeli media had reported a meeting with Biden on Monday, but Kirby said "I can't tell you at this point what that exactly is going to look like."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to make sure that the president's health and his recovery from Covid takes priority and if and how that might expect a discussion with the prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's war in Gaza will be top of the agenda for the meeting, with Biden pressing for a peace deal with Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden was suffering from mild symptoms after testing positive with Covid on Wednesday, Kirby said, taking him off the campaign trail just as he fights mounting calls from Democrats to quit his reelection bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kirby said that neither the political turmoil nor his illness had affected his duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While he's certainly focused on getting better, as anyone who has Covid would want to do, he's being kept up to speed as appropriate by his leadership team and certainly that includes on the national security front," he said. (AFP)

    UK's Starmer pledges European reset at summit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Keir Starmer has conversations pencilled in with several European leaders, as he fleshes out what he wants the new relationship with the EU to look like. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762195_1_20240718235359.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday vowed to rebuild trust with European allies damaged by Brexit as he hosted dozens of leaders at a summit where they reaffirmed backing for Ukraine and pledged to tackle irregular migration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Starmer, premier for two weeks, told more than 45 European leaders the UK would be a "friend and partner" as he started work to improve ties hit by the country's tortuous departure from the European Union under his Conservative predecessors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to work with all of you to reset relationships, rediscover our common interest and renew the bonds of trust and friendship that brighten the fabric of European Life," the 61-year-old Labour leader told them as he opened the European Political Community (EPC) meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe is grappling with challenges ranging from supporting Kyiv after Russia's full-scale assault to breaking up people-smuggling gangs contributing to record levels of irregular migration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the background hangs the increasing possibility of Donald Trump regaining the White House in November, with fears over his commitment to the Western military alliance Nato.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's newly elected running mate JD Vance is an outspoken critic of military aid to Ukraine and has pushed for negotiations with Russia to end the two-year-plus war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important to be here, for Ukraine, especially this tough period, for us during the war," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at Blenheim Palace, near Oxford, west of London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us it's very important to maintain unity in Europe because always this unity leads to strong decisions," added Zelensky before discussions with Starmer and a meeting with head of state King Charles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While at the summit, the Ukrainian leader signed long-term security cooperation agreements with the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, attending an EPC summit for the first time, reaffirmed the alliance's support for Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a departure from the often fractious relations that characterised the run-up to Brexit, Starmer, who led Labour to a landslide election win over the Tories on July 4, told European counterparts that his government would be "a friend and a partner ready to work with you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called irregular migration a "crisis" affecting every country attending. More than 380,000 undocumented migrants crossed the EU's borders last year, and tens of thousands made their way to Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer called for a sharing of resources, intelligence and tactics to "shut down the smuggling routes and smash the gangs," behind migrant Channel crossings from northern France in small boats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a problem that dogged the Tory administrations under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cooperation was "the most efficient" way to tackle the problem, French President Emmanuel Macron said, the morning after one migrant died and 71 others were rescued off the French coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has conversations pencilled in with several European leaders, including Macron, as he fleshes out what he wants the new relationship with the EU to look like.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former human rights lawyer and chief state prosecutor supported Britain remaining in the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum and was once Labour's Brexit spokesman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has ruled out rejoining the European single market, customs union or freedom of movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he does want to negotiate a new security pact with the bloc and a veterinary agreement to ease border checks on agricultural foods, as well as an improved trading deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer was quick out of the blocks to congratulate Ursula von der Leyen on securing another term as European Commission president. He eagerly anticipated "working closely" with the EU chief, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish Premier Simon Harris described Labour's reset with Europe as a "gamechanger" while European Council chief Charles Michel said he hoped that a "new chapter" would be opened with the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One high-ranking EU official said there were "good vibes" in the early contacts with the new Labour government, but warned that the EU was not looking to "reopen" the Brexit deal with Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blenheim Palace is the birthplace of Britain's World War II leader Winston Churchill. The Treaty of London, which signed into existence the Council of Europe in 1949, was on display, adding further symbolism to the proceedings. (AFP)

    32 dead in Bangladesh unrest as state TV set ablaze

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladeshi students set fire to the country's state broadcaster on Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on the network seeking to calm escalating clashes that have killed at least 32 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of protesters demanding reform of civil service hiring rules fought back and overwhelmed riot police who had fired at them with rubber bullets, chasing the retreating officers to BTV's headquarters in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incensed crowd then set ablaze the network's reception building and dozens of vehicles parked outside, a BTV official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broadcaster said "many people" were trapped inside as the fire spread but another official from the station later said that they had safely evacuated the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's government has ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police step up efforts to bring the country's deteriorating law and order situation under control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier appeared on the broadcaster on Wednesday night to condemn the "murder" of protesters and vow that those responsible will be punished regardless of their political affiliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But violence worsened on the streets despite her appeal for calm as police again attempted to break up demonstrations with rubber bullets and tear gas volleys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 25 people were killed on Thursday in addition to seven killed earlier in the week, according to a tally of casualty figures from hospitals, with hundreds more wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police weaponry was the cause of at least two-thirds of those deaths, based on descriptions given by hospital figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've got seven dead here," said an official at Uttara Crescent Hospital in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first two were students with rubber bullet injuries. The other five had gunshot injuries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 1,000 others had been treated at the hospital for injuries sustained during clashes with police, the offical said, adding many had rubber bullet wounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Didar Malekin of the online news outlet Dhaka Times said that Mehedi Hasan, one of his reporters, had been killed while covering clashes in Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several cities across Bangladesh saw violence throughout the day as riot police marched on protesters who had begun another round of human blockades on roads and highways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Helicopters rescued 60 police officers who were trapped on the roof of a campus building at Canadian University, the scene of some of Dhaka's fiercest clashes on Thursday, the elite Rapid Action Battalion police force said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have demanded an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the scheme benefits children of pro-government groups that back Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her administration is accused by rights groups of capturing state institutions and stamping out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mubashar Hasan, a Bangladesh expert at the University of Oslo in Norway, said the protests had grown into a wider expression of discontent with Hasina's autocratic rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are protesting against the repressive nature of the state," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Protesters are questioning Hasina's leadership, accusing her of clinging onto power by force," he added. "The students are in fact calling her a dictator."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladeshis reported widespread mobile internet outages around the country on Thursday, two days after internet providers cut off access to Facebook – the protest campaign's key organising platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Junior telecommunications minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak said that the government had ordered the network cut off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earlier told reporters that social media had been "weaponised as a tool to spread rumours, lies and disinformation," forcing the government to restrict access.

  <br/>
  Along with police crackdowns, demonstrators and students allied to the premier's ruling Awami League have also battled each other on the streets with bricks and bamboo rods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's national address did not assign responsibility for the deaths, but descriptions from hospital authorities and students suggest at least some died when police used supposedly non-lethal weapons on demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rights group Amnesty International said video evidence from clashes this week showed that Bangladeshi security forces had used unlawful force. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 European lawmakers on Thursday re-elected Ursula von der Leyen to a second five-year term as president of the European Commission during their first parliamentary session since the June elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Von der Leyen won with the support of 401 MEPs in the 720-seat chamber -- comfortably over the 361-vote majority she needed to remain head of the EU's executive body. There were 284 who voted against in the secret ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was among the first world leaders to congratulate von der Leyen for securing another five-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said her re-election was "a clear sign of our ability to act in the European Union, especially in difficult times," Scholz wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among her biggest pledges was a plan to launch EU defence projects starting with a European air shield, a commitment not to weaken Europe's climate change policies, and more help for European industries struggling to compete with the US and China while they invest in curbing emissions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next European Commission would propose a new competitiveness fund in the next EU budget to invest in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also outlined changes on migration policy, including a new approach for the return of migrants, and plans to triple the number of European border and coast guards. (Agencies)

    White House says Biden has tested positive for Covid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden attended a campaign event in Las Vegas on Wednesday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762052_1_20240718070954.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid during a campaign trip to Las Vegas on Wednesday and is suffering from mild symptoms, the White House said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I feel good," 81-year-old Biden said, giving reporters the thumbs up as he leaned out of his limousine dubbed "The Beast," before boarding Air Force One to head for isolation at his beach home in Rehoboth, Delaware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came minutes after the head of a Latino union said Biden had called to apologise that he could no longer address its members because he had been diagnosed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also comes as Biden is under growing pressure to drop his reelection bid against Donald Trump after a disastrous debate performance sparked concerns about his age and health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Earlier today following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for Covid-19," spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's doctor said he was suffering from a runny nose and a "non-productive cough" along with "general malaise," the White House said in an accompanying note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was now receiving the Covid drug Paxlovid, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97 percent," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Janet Murguia, the president of the Unidos union, told the crowd about the diagnosis shortly before the White House announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was just on the phone with President Biden, and he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The President has been at many events, as we all know, and he just tested positive for Covid. So of course, we understand that he needs to take the precautions that have been recommended." (AFP)

    Biden says may quit race if 'medical condition found'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said he could drop his reelection bid if doctors found he had a medical condition, as a top Democrat on Wednesday urged the 81-year-old to step aside.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's comments were the first time he has even slightly opened the door to abandoning the White House race, and came as Representative Adam Schiff, a key ally from California, urged Biden to "pass the torch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem,'" Biden told the Black media outlet BET in an interview recorded on Tuesday, when asked what could make him rethink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden however defended his decision to stay on for a rematch with Republican Donald Trump in November, and explained why he had not handed over to a younger generation after one term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said I was going to be a transitional candidate, and I thought I'd be able to move on from this, pass it on to someone else," he said. "But I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been fighting for political survival since a disastrous debate against Trump nearly three weeks ago, in which his tired and confused appearance sparked concerns about his age.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schiff became the first Democrat to call for him to step aside since the assassination attempt against Trump on Saturday, which had briefly silenced the growing chorus against Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November," Schiff said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schiff, who is expected to win a Senate seat this November, is a key White House ally in the legislature and shot to nationwide prominence as lead prosecutor during then-president Trump's first impeachment trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden was set to make a fresh attempt to prop up his candidacy in a speech to crucial Latino voters in the battleground state of Nevada later on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 20 House Democrats and one senator have now called on Biden to leave the White House race but Biden has refused, insisting he is best placed to beat Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls show Biden trailing in a tight race, with Trump pulling ahead in key swing states but no dramatic movement since the debate debacle or shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said his mental acuity was "pretty damn good" in an NBC interview on Monday, one of a series of unscripted outings aimed at showing he has what it takes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With pressure on Biden mounting, Democrats said on Wednesday they plan a virtual nomination for the president in the first week of August, ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on August 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some Democrats have slammed the scheme, accusing the party of trying to ram through Biden's candidacy and avoid a full discussion of alternative choices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party chiefs say they need to carry out the virtual roll-call by August 7, which is the deadline set by the Republican-led state of Ohio for the submission of nominations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden otherwise risks not being on the ballot in Ohio, the home state of Trump's new running mate JD Vance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Ohio's governor has signed a law giving Biden more time, the DNC said it feared further legal challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "None of this will be rushed," the heads of the DNC's rules committee said in a letter to lawmakers. "No matter what may be reported, our goal is not to fast-track."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But several lawmakers are planning to sign a letter against the virtual nomination plan and others have criticised it, according to US media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden insists that Democratic voters support him, but a poll by the Associated Press and NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research said on Wednesday that nearly two-thirds want him to step aside. (AFP)

    Deadly strikes pound Gaza as Israel PM vows no let-up

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At least 90 percent of Gazans have been forced from their homes since the war began. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762038_1_20240718041626.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel kept up its air strikes on Gaza on Wednesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to ramp up the pressure on Hamas as hopes faded for a US-announced ceasefire plan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh accused Israel of deliberately undermining negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal because it did not want to end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said it had carried out 25 strikes in 24 hours, targeting "military structures, terrorist infrastructure, terrorist cells and rigged structures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, who has repeatedly vowed to eradicate Hamas, insisted on Tuesday that despite mounting pressure, there would be no let-up in Israel's campaign against the militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is exactly the time to increase the pressure even more, to bring home all the hostages – the living and the dead – and to achieve all the war objectives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He rammed home the point in a speech to parliament, saying: "We have got them by the throat; we are on the road to absolute victory."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said 52 people, most of them women and children, had been killed in Israeli strikes over the previous 24 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The territory's civil defence agency said 30 people had been killed in three strikes in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza – one on a UN-run school, another on a house and a third on a mosque.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Wednesday it reported 15 deaths across central and northern Gaza from Israeli action, while the health ministry reported three children and a woman killed near Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In southern Gaza, two people were killed in Israeli bombardment of the Shakush area, northwest of Rafah, a medical source at Nasser Hospital said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 90 percent of Gazans have been forced from their homes, many of them seeking refuge in UN-run schools. Seven of these schools have been hit by Israeli strikes since July 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 70 percent of UN-run schools across Gaza have been hit during more than nine months of fighting, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why do they target us when we are innocent people?" asked Umm Mohammed al-Hasanat, sheltering with her family at a UN-run school in Nuseirat, which was among those hit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not carry weapons but are just sitting and trying to find safety for ourselves and our children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington has been pushing for a truce deal between Israel and Hamas since President Joe Biden released details of what he said was an Israeli ceasefire roadmap on May 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the efforts of Egyptian and Qatari mediators, indirect negotiations between the foes have made no headway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a telephone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan late on Tuesday, the Hamas leader blamed Israel for the deadlock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We dealt positively with the proposals put to us by the mediators but the occupation is avoiding the required outcome and does not want to reach an agreement under which it ends its war," Haniyeh said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a senior Hamas official said on Sunday that the group was withdrawing from the current talks following Israel's deadly strikes but was ready to return if its attitude changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza including 42 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,794 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war has devastated the coastal territory and left Gazans suffering shortages of food, medicines and basic goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference on Wednesday, the World Health Organisation's representative in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, Rik Peeperkorn, said that only 16 aid trucks had entered the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom border crossing during the last month, while dozens of trucks were still waiting to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main crossing point for aid, Rafah, which connects Gaza with Egypt, has been closed for months since Israel sent ground troops into the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO also said that out of the territory's 36 hospitals, only 15 were partially functioning and that there had been more than a thousand attacks against health facilities in Gaza since October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the US military announced that its problem-plagued mission to deliver aid via a temporary pier had officially ended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice Admiral Brad Cooper told reporters the mission was "complete, so there's no more need to use the pier." (AFP)

    Top Democrat Adam Schiff calls on Biden to exit race

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Representative Adam Schiff on Wednesday became the most heavyweight Democrat so far to publicly urge US President Joe Biden to step aside for another candidate to face Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He called on his ally to "pass the torch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schiff, a key congressional powerbroker, praised Biden but told the Los Angeles Times that he doubts that the 81-year-old incumbent can defeat Trump – a threat to "the very foundation of our democracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Californian, who is expected to win a Senate seat this November, is one of the party's most influential members and a key ally in the legislature for the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He served as chairman of the House intelligence panel when Democrats had the majority in 2019 and shot to nationwide prominence as lead prosecutor during then-president Trump's first impeachment trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Schiff aired the worry gripping the party, although often in private, that questions over Biden's age and health will doom him in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those concerns rocketed after Biden performed badly in a televised debate with Trump last month, often looking confused or unable to articulate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Biden has repeatedly said he intends to stay in the race, arguing that he remains the best person to defeat Trump. Polls show a tight overall contest, but with Trump pulling ahead in key swing states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schiff called Biden "one of the most consequential presidents in our nation's history."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he also said "a second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the president can defeat Donald Trump in November."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden should "secure his legacy" by stepping aside, he added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Bangladesh urged all universities to close on Wednesday, the day after at least six people died in violent protests over the allocation of government jobs and police raided the headquarters of the main opposition party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dhaka University, at the centre of the violence, decided to suspend classes and close its dormitories indefinitely, a university official told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University Grants Commission asked all public and private universities to close until further notice, in order to protect students, but the request did not have legal force and it was not immediately clear how many universities would comply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said at least six people were killed on Tuesday in violence across the country as student protesters clashed with pro-government student activists and with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence was reported around the capital, Dhaka, the southeastern city of Chattogram and the northern city of Rangpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight, Dhaka police raided the headquarters of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, accusing it of playing a role in the violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Asian nation has been rocked by protests for weeks over public sector job quotas, which include a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 War of Independence from Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has sparked anger among students who face high youth unemployment rates, with nearly 32 million young Bangladeshis not in work or education out of a total population of 170 million people. (Agencies)

    Thai police suspect poison killed 6 people in hotel

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Thailand on Wednesday were investigating the deaths of six people in a luxury hotel in downtown Bangkok, with police saying their demise may have been caused by poisoning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lt. Gen. Trairong Piwpan, chief of the Thai police force's forensic division, said there were traces of cyanide in the cups and thermoses that police found in the room, but initial results of an autopsy were expected on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangkok police chief Lt. Gen. Thiti Sangsawang identified the dead as two Vietnamese Americans and four Vietnamese nationals, and said there were three males and three females.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A husband and wife among the dead had invested money with two of the other victims, suggesting that money could be a motive, according to officials, citing information obtained from relatives of the victims. The investment was meant to build a hospital in Japan and the group might have been meeting to settle the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victims had booked several rooms at the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel under seven names, and some were staying on a different floor from the room where they were found dead, according to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were still looking for the seventh person included in the booking, Thiti said at a news conference at the hotel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there were no signs of a struggle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The residents of the room where the bodies were found were supposed to have checked out earlier Tuesday and their luggage had already been packed, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were discovered by a maid who went to the room after they failed to check out and found it locked from the inside, Thiti added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was food that had been ordered earlier from room service that was left uneaten, but drinks had been consumed, Thiti also said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He would not confirm a cause of death, but said the deaths appeared to have occurred about 24 hours before police arrived on the scene Tuesday evening after being called by hotel staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin went to the hotel later on Tuesday evening, and afterwards told journalists the incident was neither a robbery nor a random assault, and that it should not affect Thailand’s tourism industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pending the results of autopsies, “Our hypothesis is that they ingested something that killed them,” Srettha said. (AP)

    Elon Musk to move Space X HQ to Texas

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Musk says he will move the company's HQ from California due to the state's stance on gender issues.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk on Tuesday said he will move the headquarters of SpaceX and X to Texas after a California law blocked schools from forcing teachers to notify parents about changes to a student's gender identity.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This is the final straw," Musk said on X a day after California governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill that fired up the already fraught culture wars in a tumultuous US election year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas," Musk said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The multi-billionaire also said that he is transferring X, formerly Twitter, from its art-deco headquarters in San Francisco to Austin, a threat he has made before but never saw to completion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building," Musk wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has already moved Tesla's headquarters from Palo Alto in Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, but still maintains an "engineering headquarters" in California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tycoon has expressed deep disdain for the use of preferred pronouns, often mocking the practice on social media and dismissing it as part of a "woke" agenda that was dangerous for society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk is the father of a trans daughter from whom he is estranged, and he blames her California private school education for making her politically far left and turning her against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom on Monday enacted the law after a contentious legislative process that pitted a handful of school boards fighting for parental rights against LGBTQ activists concerned about the welfare of vulnerable students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The law reversed decisions in conservative school districts that ordered teachers to notify parents if a student changed their name or pronouns, or requested to use facilities or participate in programs that didn't match their official gender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom, who is seen as a potential alternative to President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate for the White House, has often exchanged fire with conservatives over gender issues at state schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, he signed a law that sets fines for school districts that ban textbooks portraying LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Newsom also fought bitterly with a conservative school board over its opposition to the study of gay rights figure Harvey Milk, a San Francisco public official who was assassinated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk has previously sparred with Newsom, who is a former San Francisco mayor, during the deadliest stages of the Covid-19 pandemic when he challenged the decisions of city and state health officials. (AFP)

    Five killed in Bangladesh job quota protests

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least five demonstrators were killed in Bangladesh on Tuesday during violent clashes between rival student groups over quotas for coveted government jobs, police said, a day after more than 400 others were injured.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as university students battled with counter-protesters backing the ruling Awami League party, fighting with sticks and hurling rocks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence marks an escalation in efforts to hinder a determined weekslong campaign of sit-in protests and street marches that has ignored calls by Bangladesh's prime minister and top court for students to return to class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three people were killed in the port city of Chittagong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All three had bullet injuries," Chittagong Medical College Hospital director Mohammad Taslim Uddin said, adding that "some 35 people were injured".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rival student groups marched in several key locations around the capital Dhaka, some throwing bricks at each other, with traffic in the city of 20 million almost ground to a halt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the day wore on and with some key highways blocked by the protesters, the authorities deployed the paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) force in five major cities including Dhaka and Chittagong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had been tasked with controlling "the law and order situation in view of the quota protests", a BGB spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have demanded an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of heroes from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan. (AFP)

    French PM takes on caretaker role during Olympics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal leaves following the weekly cabinet meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761868_1_20240717041226.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal's government, which will now serve only in a caretaker capacity, the presidency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French politics have been in gridlock since an inconclusive snap election earlier this month, with parties in the National Assembly scrambling to put together a governing coalition and no successor to Attal in sight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Tuesday, Attal said he would propose meetings with competing political groups "to move towards an action pact" on forming a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he ruled out any prospect of staying on himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do not aspire to be the next prime minister. I will not be the next prime minister," the outgoing premier told the broadcaster TFI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attal and his team would "handle day-to-day business until a new government is named", the Elysee Palace said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this period to come to an end as quickly as possible, it is up to republican forces to work together to build unity," it added, referring to mainstream political parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron had announced the plan earlier in the day at the government's first cabinet meeting since his allies were roundly beaten earlier this month in a snap parliamentary election he had called to "clarify" the political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron told the ministers he would ask Attal to stay on "for some weeks", probably until after the Paris Olympics, which open on July 26, meeting participants said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This gives political parties more time to build a governing coalition after the July 7 election runoff left the lower house without an overall majority grouping. (AFP)

    IMF maintains 2024 global growth forecast

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761854_1_20240716214034.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The IMF held its global growth expectations for 2024 steady in a report on Tuesday even as it cut forecasts for the United States and Japan, while warning of inflation risks and trade tensions ahead.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to grow 3.2 percent this year, unchanged from its April forecast, according to its World Economic Outlook update.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports from Asia, particularly in the technology sector," said the fund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For 2025, it expects global growth of 3.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But even as many countries saw better growth than anticipated in the first three months this year, the IMF flagged what it called notable surprises in Japan and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington-based lender also cautioned that upside risks to inflation have increased, with services prices holding up disinflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This increases the prospect of interest rates staying elevated for longer, "in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An area of concern is trade and industrial policy, with countries potentially adopting measures that impact the global economy's integration, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if risk assessments have shifted after the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump, the Republican Party's nominee in November's election, Gourinchas noted the fund will consider its implications. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people were killed and multiple others were wounded in a shooting near a Shiite mosque in Oman's capital Muscat, police said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shooting was a rare event in the otherwise stable sultanate, which has a Muslim-majority population, including a small minority of Shiites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said Pakistanis were among the wounded, but the numbers had yet to be confirmed, according to Islamabad's embassy in Oman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's ambassador to Oman, Imran Ali, visited some of the wounded in the hospital, the embassy posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert following the shooting and cancelled all visa appointments Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "US citizens should remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities," the embassy wrote on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While several mosque attacks have roiled the Arab Gulf region in recent years, the incident on Tuesday is unprecedented for Oman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 2015 suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in Kuwait killed at least 27 worshippers and wounded more than 200 others. It was claimed by the Islamic State group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That same year, Saudi Arabia saw two attacks on Shiite mosques in the span of one week. (AFP)

    Trump picks Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as running mate

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump won formal nomination on Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist for running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of last weekend's failed assassination attempt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump announced 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his vice presidential pick, rewarding a one-time harsh critic who became one of his most reliable - and uncompromising - supporters in Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 78, is guaranteed a hero's welcome at the convention in Milwaukee, where delegates delivered their formal nomination two days after the scandal-plagued former president survived an assassination attempt at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," Trump posted on Truth Social.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vance had been widely expected as Trump's pick. He will bolster the ticket on the right wing, but with less chance of expanding appeal to more moderate voters and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The standard-bearer for a new kind of populism that has come to the fore under Trump, Vance is also one of the least experienced VP picks in modern history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he embraces the ex-president's isolationist, anti-immigration America First movement. Vance is further to the right than his new boss on many issues including abortion, where he embraces calls for federal legislation. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a car bombing at a cafe in Somalia's capital Mogadishu that was packed with football fans watching the the Euro 2024 final has risen to nine, security sources said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Witnesses described scenes of panic and chaos after the powerful blast late on Sunday, with people scrambling for safety and the main entrance to the cafe destroyed by the blaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Yusuf, an official from the national security agency, said nine civilians were killed and 20 others wounded in the explosion, raising the official toll of five given by police late on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The popular Top Coffee restaurant, which is located near the presidential palace in the centre of the city, was thronged with young men watching the final that Spain won 2-1 against England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were many people inside the restaurant, most of them youth who were watching the football match... but thanks to God, most of them made their way out safely after using ladders to climb up and jump over the backside perimeter wall," Yusuf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the state-run Somali National News Agency said Sunday it was carried out by Al-Qaeda linked Al-Shabaab jihadists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images posted online showed a huge fireball and plumes of smoke billowing into the night sky as the explosion ripped through the cafe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was inside the restaurant watching the football match when I heard a huge explosion, there was smoke, dust and fire at the front side of the restaurant and we panicked," Said Muktar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I and several other people rushed towards the main entrance, but it was completely inaccessible," he said, adding that the "whole situation was chaos".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images of the aftermath of the bombing on Monday showed piles of rubble where the restaurant once stood and several burnt-out vehicles, as local residents inspected the scene. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Florida judge appointed by Donald Trump has dismissed the criminal case against the former US president on charges of mishandling top secret documents, saying the way that Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed was improper.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision is a huge victory for Trump, who had been accused of endangering national security by holding onto top secret documents after leaving the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Aileen Cannon made her ruling after lawyers for the 78-year-old argued for a partial stay of proceedings to allow for an assessment of a Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Former President Trump's Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on the Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith is GRANTED," Aileen wrote in her order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Superseding Indictment is DISMISSED because Special Counsel Smith's appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Trump is set to be annointed as his party's champion at the Republican National Convention, days after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Florida case, Trump was facing 31 counts of "willful retention of national defense information," each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also faced charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden sought to calm a divided nation after his rival Donald Trump survived an assassination bid, saying in a rare Oval Office address on Sunday it was time to lower the temperature of America's hostile politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "You know, the political record in this country has gotten very heated. It's time to cool it down," Biden said in the televised speech, just the third he has given from behind the historic Resolute Desk during his presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the country reeled from images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania, Biden added that US politics "must never be a literal battlefield, a, God forbid, a killing field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old Democrat said that both sides had a responsibility to ease the situation ahead of a deeply divided election that would now be a "time of testing" for the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators said that they were still probing the motives of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot dead by snipers at the event in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday after firing multiple shots with a legally-bought semi-automatic rifle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former president Trump said on social media on Sunday that Americans should not allow "evil to win," adding it was "more important than ever that we stand United." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The civil defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said Sunday that 15 people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering war displaced where the Israeli military said it had targeted "terrorists".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike on the UN-run Abu Araban site in central Gaza's Nuseirat camp was the fifth on a school-turned-shelter in eight days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Abu Araban school was housing "thousands of displaced people," civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said, adding that most of the dead were women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools in Nuseirat were the target for two of the earlier school strikes as Israel keeps up its offensive against Hamas Palestinian militants who triggered the war with their October 7 attack on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its air force "struck a number of terrorists who were operating in the area of UNRWA's Abu Araban school building in Nuseirat".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the building had "served as a hideout" and base for "attacks" on Israeli troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel says Hamas uses schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure for military purposes. Hamas denies the accusation. (AFP)

    Kenya police say 8 bodies found in Nairobi dumpsite

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight female bodies have been recovered so far from a dumpsite in a Nairobi slum, Kenyan police said on Sunday, adding that they were pursuing possible links to cults, serial killers or rogue medical practitioners.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gruesome discoveries of mutilated and dismembered bodies dumped in plastic bags in a rubbish tip in Mukuru in the south of the Kenyan capital have horrified and angered the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's acting national police chief Douglas Kanja said the first six corpses were found on Friday and more body parts were retrieved on Saturday, with preliminary investigations revealing that all were female.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were severely dismembered in different states of decomposition and left in sacks," Kanja told a press conference, adding that investigations were ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kanja also called for public cooperation in "so that we bring the perpetrators of these heinous acts to book".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amin Mohammed, the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, said the ages of the victims ranged between about 18 to 30 and that all had been killed and butchered in the same manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police were looking into a number of hypotheses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Are we dealing with a cult that is associated with criminal activities, are we dealing with serial killers," he said at the press briefing alongside Kanja.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We even could be dealing with rogue medical practitioners [involved in] criminal activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya was left reeling last year by the discovery of mass graves in a forest near the Indian Ocean coast containing the bodies of more than 400 members of a doomsday sect, one of the world's worst cult-related massacres. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slammed South Korean "scum" on Sunday for launching anti-regime propaganda leaflets across the border via balloon, warning they would pay "a very high price".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Korean peninsula has seen tit-for-tat balloon campaigns in recent weeks, with Pyongyang floating trash-filled balloons southward in protest of ones carrying propaganda leaflets sent northward by South Korean activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim Yo Jong, a key regime spokesperson, said she was informed the latest batch of "dirty leaflets and things of the ROK scum" had been found in North Korean territory along the border, according to a statement carried in English by the official Korean Central News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ROK is an abbreviation of South Korea's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korean military personnel were "now making an all-out search, throwing into fire and disposing of the found rubbishes", she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the ROK scum are not stopping this crude and dirty play," she added, using the initials of the North's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ROK clans will be tired from suffering a bitter embarrassment and must be ready for paying a very high price."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang has already sent more than a thousand balloons carrying trash southward in what it says is retaliation for balloons carrying propaganda criticising Kim Jong Un's rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Seoul has fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="France's President Emmanuel Macron speaks with his wife Brigitte Macron during the Bastille Day military parade along the Avenue Foch in Paris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761553_1_20240714182159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The French armed forces will take an unusual detour at the start of their annual Bastille Day march on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations to host the Olympic Games blocked the national day parade from its traditional route on the Champs Elysees, and a smaller military contingent will instead march on the nearby Avenue Foch - one of the most prestigious streets in Paris and one of the most expensive addresses in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All eyes will be on the host, President Emmanuel Macron, who last year cut a more impressive figure, hosting rising superpower India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi at France's triumphant national day parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, with the Olympics just around the corner, France has no international star guest for this year's parade - and French political leaders' minds will be elsewhere, pondering the power vacuum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This month's snap elections, called by Macron to clarify France's direction after the far right sent shock-waves through the political establishment by coming first in European polls, left the country without a ruling minority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against this backdrop, the reduced and rerouted parade risks becoming a new symbol of drift, even with the addition of the arrival in Paris of the Olympic Torch, ahead of the July 26 to August 11 Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No tank or armoured vehicle will take part, and only 4,000 foot soldiers will march, down from 6,500 last year, but the military fly-past will see 45 aeroplanes and 22 helicopters soar over Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regiments honoured on the parade will include those from France's allies and former French colonies that took part in the country's 1944 World War II liberation 80 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parade's final section will also honour the Olympic spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colonel Thibault Vallette of the elite Cadre Noir de Saumur cavalry school and 2016 equestrian gold medallist in Rio will be bringing the torch down the route before relay runners carry it around the capital. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Ryan Leung is the first person from the SAR to successfully swim across the North Channel, between Ireland and Scotland, one of the marathon swimming challenges of the Oceans Seven.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 35-year-old swam 40 kilometres in 14 hours and 5 minutes with the swim ratified by the Irish Long Distance Swimming Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an Instagram post, the swimmer said he spent more than three hours on the last seven kilometres due to the current.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also wrote: "not fast but once again my fat is proven life-saving – average water temperature is 12.7 degrees Celsius, but I am sure most of it was 11 degrees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who used the challenge to raise funds for charities supporting grassroots youth development, thanked his fans for all their support.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secret Service said former president Donald Trump was "safe" after he was rushed off stage when gunshots were fired at a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the bangs rang out, 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspected shooter was confirmed dead, along with one bystander, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The former president is safe," the Secret Service said in a post on X, and his campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," said spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in a bitter replay of their 2020 clash, said there was "no place for this kind of violence in America".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well," Biden said in a statement, adding: "I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old, staying at his house in Rehoboth, Delaware, gave a televised statement repeating his message, saying "we cannot be like this".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. (AFP)

    UK's Labour party to focus on 'turbo charging growth'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's incoming Labour government will focus on measures to "turbo charge growth" when it unveils its legislative plans at next week's King's Speech, prime minister Keir Starmer said in comments released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "From energy, to planning, to unbreakable fiscal rules, my government is serious about delivering the stability that is going to turbo charge growth that will create wealth in every corner of the UK," said Starmer, whose party won a huge landslide earlier this month, ending 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our work is urgent. There is no time to waste. We are hitting the ground running by bringing forward the laws we will need to rebuild our country for the long-term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The task of national renewal will not be easy... but the legislation set out at the King's Speech will build on the momentum of our first days in office and make a difference to the lives of working people," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charles III will deliver the King's Speech on Wednesday, as parliament formally reopens after the July 4 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite its name, the address is not written by the monarch but by the government which uses it to detail the laws it proposes to make over the coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it was working on more than 35 bills "to deliver an ambitious parliamentary session that will be built on a bedrock of economic security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include measures to enforce public spending rules and others to prevent a repeat of the utility bill price hikes that triggered the UK's recent cost-of-living crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislation will also flesh out announcements already made this week, such as the launching of a fund to draw investment into the UK and of a body tasked with boosting clean power by 2030, as well as the opening of recruitment for a new border security command. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senator Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure of the US political left, on Saturday threw his support behind Joe Biden's White House campaign, dismissing calls for the president to withdraw from the race over health concerns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Enough! Mr Biden may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate," independent senator Sanders wrote in a New York Times column, adding that "it's time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking."
  <br/>

  Sanders's column comes amid steadily growing calls from Democratic officials and donors for the 81-year-old Biden to step aside following a disastrous performance in his June 27 debate with former president Donald Trump. So far, some 20 members of Congress have called for him to leave the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls taken since the debate show Trump with a national lead over Biden, though within the margin of error. They also show some key battleground states, including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, shifting in the Republican's favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a majority of Americans – including Democrats – believe Biden is too old to serve again, according to a recent poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president did not help his own cause when, at a summit in Washington earlier this week, he mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as his foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, however, insisted during an appearance on Friday that he is, and will remain, his party's flagbearer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am running and we're going to win," he told an enthusiastic audience in Detroit, amid chants of "Don't you quit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate and Vice President Kamala Harris doubled down her support for Biden, calling him a "fighter" at a campaign event on Saturday in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where Trump is also holding a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, we will continue to fight. We will continue to organise. And in November, we will win," said Harris, who some pundits have speculated could lead the Democratic ticket if Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seeking to allay concerns, Biden spoke with members of the Democratic Party's left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus in a virtual meeting on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will also sit for interviews next week with NBC News and Black Entertainment Television (BET).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders, who at 82 is himself seeking reelection to the Senate in November, did acknowledge the signs of the president's aging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But given Biden's achievements – and the record of Trump, "who has 34 felony convictions and... has told thousands of documented lies" – the senator brushed Biden's shortcomings aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, I know," he wrote. "Mr Biden is old, is prone to gaffes, walks stiffly and had a disastrous debate with Mr Trump. But this I also know: A presidential election is not an entertainment contest. It does not begin or end with a 90-minute debate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed the eruption of anti-Biden rhetoric partly on "the corporate media (which) has obsessively focused on the June presidential debate and the cognitive capabilities of a man who has, perhaps, the most difficult and stressful job in the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders also blamed those Democrats who he said had "joined that circular firing squad."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He challenged the president to do more – to "propose and fight for a bold agenda" that would help lift working families "who have been left behind for far too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden, he concluded, was "a good and decent Democratic president with a record of real accomplishment," including helping rebuild the US economy and shoring up the country's crumbling infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the sake of our kids and future generations, he must win." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Alec Baldwin made his first public comments to thank his supporters on Saturday after the stunning early end to his involuntary manslaughter trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now," Baldwin said in a brief Instagram post that accompanied a photo of him sitting in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, courtroom. “To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor wept a day earlier when Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case three days into the trial and said he could not be criminally charged again in the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Neither he nor his lawyers spoke to reporters as he left the courthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evidence that sank the case was ammunition that was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammunition unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers alleged they “buried” it and filed a motion to dismiss the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge said the withholding of the evidence tainted the “fundamental fairness” of the trial of the 66-year-old Baldwin, who could have gotten 18 months in prison if he were convicted. (AP)

    Death toll in Gaza camp 'safe zone' strike rises to 90

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel had declared Al-Mawasi a "safe zone" as it pushed into Rafah near the Egyptian border, but on Saturday Palestinians raced to collect dozens of casualties from the military's latest strike.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sirens wailed and women screamed as children were pulled bloody and unmoving from the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What have they done? they're children, children," one woman cried. "Seven-year-old and 12-year-old children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Mawasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people had sought refuge, was left a chaos-strewn wasteland by one of the deadliest Israeli strikes since the start of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas-run territory's health ministry said at least 90 people were killed, half of them women and children. It said another 300 people were wounded in the "massacre".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an attack in the Khan Younis area had targeted Hamas military strategist Mohammed Deif and Rafa Salama, a brigade commander, but there was "no certainty that the two were eliminated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located near the city of Khan Younis, Al-Mawasi was designated a humanitarian area after Israel in May ordered civilians to evacuate from other parts of the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been warning for months that there is no safe place for anyone in Gaza amid Israel's military bombardment," said UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians, which operates health sites in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said hundreds of thousands of displaced people were sheltering in the "safe zone," which had been targeted before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Black smoke billowed behind a wide, ash-strewn street in Al-Mawasi where bodies lay in pools of blood, some covered by sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Men struggling to carry the wounded wove through those beyond help to reach ambulances waiting with open doors. Others were piled onto donkey-pulled carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are people who have lost limbs everywhere. It's a scene the mind cannot even imagine," Mahmoud Chahine said near a market struck in the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the Nasser Hospital reportedly saying it was at full capacity, ambulances kept arriving, carting in the wounded on orange stretchers, including a man with a towel tied around his leg as a makeshift tourniquet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman outside the hospital could be heard pleading: "Please enough, enough for God's sake."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said the attack against Deif "struck an open area" that "was not a tent complex but an operational compound."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our information, only Hamas terrorists were present and there were no civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Netanyahu's office, he had discussed the strike with security and military officials as part of his goal "to eliminate senior Hamas officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called the claim that Deif had been targeted "false allegations" intended "to cover up the magnitude of the horrific massacre" in Al-Mawasi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said heavy fire was preventing its teams from reaching the "many bodies" scattered in the streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmoud Abu Akar, an eyewitness, described repeated missiles raining down on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time people tried to get close to rescue others, they would strike," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was no warning at all, it happened all of a sudden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since telling people to relocate to Al-Mawasi in May, the Israeli military has been accused of repeatedly striking the area in deadly attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June the International Committee of the Red Cross said 22 people were killed by shelling that damaged its office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Returning from the Nasser Hospital on Saturday, Louise Wateridge, from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said children had suffered life-changing injuries and people were angry there was no reprieve from the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no safety here, no matter where people go," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's strike came on the 281st day of the war that was unleashed by Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, which resulted in 1,195 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military reprisal has killed at least 38,443 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday his government had "no certainty" that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in a strike that officials in Hamas-run Gaza said killed dozens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israel attacked Gaza today in an attempt to eliminate Mohammed Deif and his deputy, Rafa Salama," Netanyahu told a press conference hours after the attack on Al-Mawasi, a designated safe zone in Gaza's south sheltering displaced Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no certainty that the two were eliminated," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, at least 71 people were killed and nearly 300 wounded in the strike on Al-Mawasi, near the southern city of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had designated the area a safe zone and told civilians in other areas in Gaza to go there for safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu described Deif, head of the Hamas military wing, as "the planner and leader" of the October 7 attack that set off the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and bring back all hostages from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The elimination of the heads of Hamas advances the achievement of all our objectives," said the right-wing premier who faces mounting opposition to the conduct of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent weeks, we have identified clear cracks within Hamas," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's operation also contributes to this, regardless of what its outcomes will be." (AFP)

    Wedding party resumes for son of Asia's richest man

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The lavish parties for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant end on Sunday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761488_1_20240714014258.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lavish wedding celebrations for the son of Asia's richest man resumed on Saturday with a star-studded guest list including Hollywood celebrities, global business leaders and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani's youngest son Anant and his fiancee Radhika Merchant, both 29, are tying the knot over the weekend in Mumbai following months of pre-marriage parties that have set a new benchmark in matrimonial extravagance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's itinerary included a blessing ceremony during which the world's rich and famous greeted the couple at the wedding venue, a 16,000-capacity convention centre owned by the Ambani family's conglomerate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage from inside shared by local broadcasters showed Modi, whose policies have been warmly supported by the groom's father over his decade in power, was among the guests to pay their respects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event followed a formal ceremony and party on Friday attended by the likes of socialite Kim Kardashian, actor John Cena, and former British premiers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA boss Gianni Infantino, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and Samsung chairman Jay Y Lee were among the hundreds of other famous figures present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Best wishes to the new couple and double happiness!" Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong posted on social media platform X along with footage of the couple from inside the venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This weekend's celebrations end on Sunday with a reception party, and cap months of extravagant pre-wedding festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier events this year included a party at the Ambanis' ancestral home where a purpose-built Hindu temple was unveiled, and private performances by R&B star Rihanna and Canada's Justin Bieber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guests at that gala included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former US president Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, along with a who's who of India's sporting and entertainment worlds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, the couple embarked on a four-day Mediterranean cruise along with 1,200 guests, with singer Katy Perry performing at a masquerade ball at a French chateau in Cannes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mumbai this year overtook Beijing to become the Asian city with the most billionaires, according to a Chinese research institute survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite India being the world's fastest growing economy, the gap between rich and poor remains vast. More than half of the country's 1.4 billion people live on less than four dollars per day, according to World Bank figures from 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the wedding and its VIP attendees have been the subject of relentless and laudatory media coverage in India, the reaction among the public has been mixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They must have spent over US$60 million, while I will struggle to earn just US$400 this month," said Mumbai general store worker Jitesh Ingle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But this is our life. What can we do? We can only watch their celebrations on YouTube."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anant's father Mukesh is chairman of Reliance Industries, a family-founded conglomerate that has grown into India's biggest company by market cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patriarch is the world's 11th richest person with a fortune of more than US$123 billion, according to Forbes, and is no stranger to making a statement when it comes to family marriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He held the most expensive wedding in India to date for his daughter in 2018, which reportedly cost US$100 million and saw US singer Beyonce perform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family's lucrative interests include retail partnerships with Armani and other luxury brands, more than 40 percent of India's mobile phone market and an Indian Premier League cricket team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 27-floor family home Antilia is one of Mumbai's most prominent landmarks, reportedly costing more than US$1 billion to build and with a permanent staff of 600 servants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchant is the daughter of well-known pharmaceutical moguls. (AFP)

    Imran Khan's illegal marriage conviction overturned

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, however, have now been arrested on a new graft charge. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761484_1_20240714010400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court overturned ex-prime minister Imran Khan's conviction on illegal marriage charges on Saturday, though he remains jailed after fresh charges were swiftly brought against him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Khan was slapped with a trio of convictions in the days before February elections – cases he says were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cases have now all been at least partially rolled back on appeal, with a treason conviction carrying a decade jail term overturned in April, and a 14-year graft sentence suspended in June, though the conviction still stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi had also been sentenced to seven years for allegedly marrying too soon after her divorce, in a breach of Islamic law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an Islamabad judge announced on Saturday that the couple's appeals were accepted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan remains locked up, though, with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party saying a court in eastern Lahore had approved his arrest over three cases alleging he incited riots in May 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spokesman Ahmed Janjua said it was "yet another gimmick to keep the illegal imprisonment prolonged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, PTI said Khan and Bibi had also been arrested on a separate graft case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month a UN panel of experts found Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose," it said, calling for his immediate release after nearly a year in jail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted after falling out with the military establishment, which wields huge influence over civilian politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In opposition he waged a campaign of defiance against the generals, who directly ruled Pakistan for decades of its history, even accusing them of being behind an assassination attempt that wounded him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the former cricket star's comeback was hobbled by scores of legal cases, which analysts say were likely brought at the behest of the military establishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan was first briefly arrested in May 2023, sparking nationwide unrest from PTI supporters, some of which targeted military facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government and military cited the attacks as justification for a sweeping crackdown on PTI, which saw its senior leadership decimated by arrests and defections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PTI candidates were forced to stand as independents in the February 8 elections, which had been repeatedly delayed amid political chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan's arrest and conviction for graft in August 2023 meant he was barred from standing for office himself, confined to a cell in Adiala Jail south of Islamabad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the setbacks, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless they were blocked from power by a broad coalition of military-backed rival parties, amid widespread allegations of vote-tampering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gallup Pakistan analyst Bilal Gilani said the rolling back of the cases against Khan now could suggest the establishment was softening its stance in the wake of the election – or that the courts were defying their attempts to keep him confined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an important judgement, because essentially now there are a limited number of cases left," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Immediate release is quite impossible, but... the chances of release are getting clearer by the day," he added. (AFP)

 The Kremlin on Saturday warned the deployment of US missiles in Germany could make European capitals targets for Russian missiles in a repeat of Cold War-style confrontation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke of a "paradox" in which "Europe is a target for our missiles, our country is a target for US missiles in Europe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have enough capacity to contain these missiles but the potential victims are the capitals of these countries," he said, speaking to Russian state television channel Russia 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peskov also hinted that such a confrontation could undermine Europe as a whole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Europe is not living its best moment. In a different configuration, a repeat of history is inevitable," he said when the channel's anchor Pavel Zarubin pointed out that the Cold War had ended with the Soviet Union's collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House announced on Wednesday during a Nato summit that it would periodically station long-range weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles in Germany from 2026 as a deterrent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exercising these advanced capabilities will demonstrate the United States' commitment to Nato and its contributions to European integrated deterrence," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin criticised the move, accusing Washington of taking a step towards a new Cold War and of directly participating in the conflict in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov held a telephone call with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin where they discussed lowering the risk of "possible escalation."

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Saturday arrested a man after two suitcases believed to contain the remains of two men were dumped on a famous bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suitcases were discovered on Wednesday after police got a report of a man behaving suspiciously on the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, southwest England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Detectives have arrested a man in connection with an investigation into the discovery of human remains on Clifton Suspension Bridge," said the Metropolitan Police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old suspect was detained in Bristol and will be taken to London for questioning later on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Metropolitan Police said the victims have not been formally identified, but both are believed to be men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-based force took over the investigation after evidence suggested that the wanted man had travelled to Bristol from the UK capital earlier on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clifton Suspension Bridge, designed by the pioneering engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is one of the oldest surviving suspension bridges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opened in 1864, the bridge over the Avon Gorge is one of Bristol's top tourist attractions and a symbol of the city. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepali rescue teams on Saturday recovered the first body from around 50 people missing after monsoon rains triggered a landslide that swept two buses off a highway and into a river.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force of Friday's landslide in central Chitwan district pushed the vehicles over concrete crash barriers and down a steep embankment, at least 30 metres from the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One body has been found about 55 kilometres from the accident site," said police spokesman Kumar Neupane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District official Khimananda Bhusal said that roughly 50 people remained unaccounted for, revising down the number of missing from the 63 reported by authorities on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to confirm the total number because we don't know if the buses stopped to add or remove passengers along the way," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of rescuers spent hours struggling to comb the raging Trishuli river with rafts, sensor equipment and dive teams to find any trace of the passengers or the vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teams on Saturday also moved downstream in hope of locating the missing passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fierce currents made worse by this week's torrential downpours have hampered their efforts so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chitwan district chief Indra Dev Yadav said that all authorities in the area have been instructed to stay on alert for any signs of the missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The river is narrow here and very deep," he said. "The water level is high, its speed is high and its turbidity is also high."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accident happened before dawn on Friday along the Narayanghat-Mugling highway, around 100 kilometres west of Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One bus was heading from the capital to Gaur in Rautahat district in southern Nepal, and the other was en route to Kathmandu from southern Birgunj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A driver was killed in a separate accident on the same road after a boulder hit his bus. He died as he was being treated at a hospital. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Gaza said an Israeli strike on a displacement camp in the south of the Palestinian territory killed at least 71 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 280 others were injured in the strike on Al-Mawasi camp, the ministry said, condemning a "brutal massacre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as the Israeli military pursued attacks in central Gaza with artillery fire and drone strikes, while Palestinian medics said one bombing killed a father and his three daughters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestine Red Crescent medics said the strike on a home in Deir al-Balah city killed Rital al-Raey, five, Mai, eight, Leila, nine and their 40-year-old father Mohammed al-Raey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their bodies were taken to the city's Al-Aqsa hospital, the medical workers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Civil Defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that Israeli forces had withdrawn from Tal al-Hawa and other districts, after days of fighting. It said at least 60 bodies had been found in Tal al-Hawa and a neighbouring area after the withdrawal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the agency said 60 bodies had been found in nearby Shujaiya after Israel ended an operation there. Israel's military said it had killed 150 militants in Shujaiya during a two-week operation against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday the army said operations were continuing in Gaza City as well as "targeted, intelligence-based" missions in Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip. (AFP)

    Biden hits campaign trail as calls to quit pile up

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At least President Zelensky, a former comedian, could see the funny side of Joe Biden's gaffe at the Nato summit. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761395_1_20240713021914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden returns to the campaign trail on Friday, pushing ahead with his reelection bid after a mixed performance at a major news conference failed to silence calls for him to quit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old will give a speech bashing rival Donald Trump in Detroit in the rust-belt state of Michigan, a crucial battleground state that the Democrat must win in November's election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A defiant Biden insisted in a pivotal appearance at a Nato summit on Thursday that he would run again, and win – despite concerns about his age and health following a disastrous debate performance two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a series of gaffes, including referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as "Vice President Trump," kept Biden's fitness for a second term under the microscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, said he had met with Biden late on Thursday, as the number of members calling on the president to step aside rose to 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeffries said he and Biden "expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward" but did not give further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president has faced a steady drumbeat of Democrats calling for him to abandon his 2024 candidacy since the June 27 debate, during which Biden often lost his train of thought and appeared tired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden has obstinately dug in and insists that he can convince voters to back him despite most polls showing him trailing the criminally convicted, twice-impeached Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign event in Detroit is his fourth trip this year to the state, part of the industrial "blue wall" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that were key to his 2020 win against his rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's speech is expected to focus on "Project 2025", a blueprint by hardline conservatives for the first days of a Trump term that Democrats have pinned on the former president, despite the 78-year-old's denials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The press conference on Thursday appeared to buy Biden some time even if it was far from a knockout blow, with three more lawmakers urging him to quit just minutes after it finished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was the "most qualified person to run for president," rejecting calls for him to step aside before the November 5 vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He acknowledged he had to "allay fears" in the Democratic party and should "pace myself a little more" after blaming jet lag and a cold for his stumbling debate performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also fielded a series of foreign and domestic policy questions with detailed if meandering answers and relatively few slip-ups, though he did mix up Europe and Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were damaging moments on Thursday, with the Trump-Harris mixup and an earlier gaffe at the Nato summit in which he introduced Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The concerns over Biden are also affecting Democratic donors, with Hollywood star and high-profile supporter George Clooney calling on Biden to step aside on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of other key donors have told the largest Biden campaign fund that around US$90 million in pledged donations is on hold if he carries on running, the New York Times reported on Friday. (AFP)

    UK to release thousands of inmates due to overcrowding

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Britain's new justice minister Shabana Mahmood says failure to act now could lead to "the collapse of the criminal justice system." Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761397_1_20240713024159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of prisoners are to be released early from September in order to prevent the "collapse" of the prisons system, the UK's new justice minister announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shabana Mahmood said failure to do so risked the "total breakdown of law and order," with just 700 places left for men, and jails operating at 99 percent capacity since 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England and Wales have the highest per capita prison population in Western Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said this week that urgent action was required, as prisons were at "breaking point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release initiative would not apply to violent offenders serving more than four years, sex offenders and those in prison for domestic abuse offences as well as those on life sentences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood, appointed last week after Labour's general election win, warned in dramatic language that if prisons ran out of cell space, there could be "van-loads of dangerous people circling the country with nowhere to go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With officers unable to act, criminals could do whatever they want, without consequence. We could see looters running amok, smashing in windows, robbing shops and setting neighbourhoods alight," she said in a speech at a prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In short, if we fail to act now, we face the collapse of the criminal justice system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood accused the previous Conservative government of a "dereliction of duty" regarding the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her comments echoed Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who earlier told reporters while attending a Nato summit in the United States that the ousted Tories were guilty of "gross irresponsibility."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of the problem was worse than we thought," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood's Conservative predecessor in the post, Alex Chalk, had reportedly pressed prime minister Rishi Sunak to impose similar measures before the election, but was overruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Labour's plans, prisoners who are eligible for automatic release after serving half their sentence will be freed earlier than the normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plans involve a temporary reduction of how long prisoners must serve behind bars, from 50 percent to 40 percent of their sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The releases will start in September to give the Prison and Probation Service time to plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood also announced the recruitment of 1,000 additional trainee probation officers by next March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total number of prisoners hit over 87,505 on Friday – of whom 83,755 were men – leaving just 1,451 spaces available, official figures showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of 2023, the average occupancy rate in men's prisons had "routinely been higher than 99 percent," according to the Ministry of Justice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials say the prison system needs a buffer of around 1,425 cell spaces in men's prisons at all time to deal with sudden influxes of inmates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six new prisons to create an extra 20,000 places are being built – of which about 10,000 will be ready by the end of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Prison Governors' Association (PGA) said it welcomed the speed of the new measures while demanding a "full review" and that "the public must never be placed in this position again."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PGA chairman Mark Fairhurst said the measures would free up around 4,500-5,000 more spaces and give prisons around 12 to 18 months before further steps would be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Prison Reform Trust chief executive Pia Sinha said ministers "had the good sense to listen to the advice of its officials and introduce further emergency measures." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 16 students were killed on Friday when a school in central Nigeria collapsed on pupils taking exams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trapped students cried for help under the rubble after the Saint Academy school in Jos North district of Plateau State fell in on classrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents desperately looked for their children as rescue workers tried to reach the victims with heavy machinery. Images from the scene showed crowds gathering round a caved-in concrete building and heaps of debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have so far only said "several students" were killed but a witness saw five dead bodies in one hospital morgue and 11 in another. All were wearing school uniforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his mother at his hospital bedside, injured student Wulliya Ibrahim said: "I entered the class not more than five minutes, when I heard a sound, and the next thing is I found myself here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are many in the class, we are writing our exams," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Emergency Management Agency said the two-storey building housing Saint Academy collapsed killing "several students."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had completed the search and rescue operation and would provide details later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chika Obioha, a resident at the scene, said he saw at least eight bodies at the site and that dozens more had been injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone is helping out to see if we can rescue more people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 15 rescued and injured students were admitted to the Our Lady of Apostles Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse but residents said it came after three days of heavy rains in Plateau. (AFP)

 A Russian regional airliner carrying three crew members crashed in a forested area near Moscow on Friday, killing all on board, Russian news agencies reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plane was a Superjet 100 regional jet and was carrying out a "test flight" before crashing near the Russian city of Kolomna, the TASS news agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cause of the crash was not clear.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A landslide swept two passenger buses carrying at least 63 people into a swollen river in central Nepal early Friday while continuous rain and more landslides were making rescue efforts difficult.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three survivors apparently swam to safety, but rescuers by late morning had not found any trace of the buses, which likely were submerged and swept downstream in the Trishuli River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy monsoon downpours in the past few days have swollen the waterways and turned their waters murky brown, making it even more difficult to see the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buses were on the key highway connecting the capital to southern parts of Nepal when they were swept away around 3am near Simaltal, about 120 kilometres west of Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More landslides blocked routes to the area in several places, officials said. Additional rescuers and security forces were sent to help with the rescue efforts. Police and army personnel were searching using rubber rafts. Divers with scuba gear were also dispatched, according to the Chitwan district police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One bus was carrying at least 24 people, while the other had at least 42, but more could have boarded en route, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bus was hit by another landslide on Friday morning a short distance away on the same highway. Officials said the driver was killed but it was not clear if there were any other casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was saddened by the news and expressed concern over recent flooding and landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that several government agencies were searching for the missing, in a post on the social media platform X. (AP)

    Biden introduces Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Thursday mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky as "President Putin" before correcting himself at the Nato summit in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Biden said, referring to Zelensky, before correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going to beat President Putin, President Zelensky. I am so focused on beating Putin," Biden said while correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The room at the summit gasped when Biden misidentified Zelensky as Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been under intense scrutiny in recent days and has faced doubts, including from members of his own Democratic Party, about his reelection chances after a weak and faltering performance in a debate late last month against Republican former President Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday, Biden plans to hold a solo press conference at the Nato summit, his first time facing the press alone since November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's remarks on Thursday came as Nato members extended support to Ukraine to combat the Russian assault that began in February 2022.

    Zelensky urges Nato leaders to lift all strike limits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Volodymyr Zelensky is calling on Kyiv's backers to allow his outgunned forces greater scope to strike deeper inside Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761250_1_20240712052011.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called on Nato leaders to drop all restrictions on letting Kyiv strike inside Russia with Western weaponry as they wrapped up a three-day summit in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled 75th anniversary gala in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Moscow and backing for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gathering has been overshadowed by uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden – who will give a press conference on Thursday – fights for his own political survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian leader joined his Nato counterparts after receiving promises of new air defences for Ukraine and as allies began the transfer of long-promised F-16 jets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zelensky called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further – including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to win, if we want to prevail, if we want to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key allies such as Washington and Germany relaxed conditions on Ukraine hitting inside Russia in May in response to Moscow's offensive toward the second city Kharkiv, but they kept in place some limits on how far and under which circumstances Kyiv could strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only way to hit military targets, missile launchers or airfields which are conducting attacks against Ukraine is to hit military targets on Russian territory, because the frontline and the borderline is more or less the same," Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato allies have put together a package of support for Ukraine including the pledge of more Patriot missile systems to defend the skies over the war-torn country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky said he hoped to see the air defenses – including one new Patriot system from the United States – delivered "as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato's leaders at the summit once again risked disappointing Zelensky by refusing to issue Ukraine a clear invitation to join their alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a bid to soften any upset, leaders called Ukraine's path to membership "irreversible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros (US$43 billion) in military support "within the next year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are doing and will continue to do everything to ensure that the day comes when Ukraine is invited and becomes a Nato member, and I am confident we will achieve this," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States on Wednesday also announced an important step to bolster Nato's own deterrence against Russia in Europe by saying it would begin "episodic deployments" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would eventually look to permanently station them in Germany, and the missiles would "have significantly longer range" than current US systems in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed the move and said it would help in "securing peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Kremlin on Thursday struck back, saying it was planning "response measures" to contain the "very serious threat" from Nato, accusing the alliance of being "fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CNN meanwhile reported that the United States foiled a Russian plot earlier this year to assassinate the chief executive of a major German arms maker supplying weaponry to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said he did not want to comment on those specific reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said there has been "a Russian campaign organised by the security services to conduct hostile actions against Nato allies, across the alliance, with sabotage attempts, with cyber attacks, with arson, with different types of hostile actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of this campaign is, of course, to intimidate Nato allies from supporting Ukraine, and what we have seen over the last months that Nato allies have not been intimidated," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the sit-down with Zelensky, Nato shifted attention eastwards by welcoming the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington summit is the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato agreed to several initiatives with the partner countries, including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation, and providing Ukraine with non-lethal help. (AFP)

    'The Shining' actor Shelley Duvall dies aged 75

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Director Stanley Kubrick put Duvall through the ringer to play the part of Wendy Torrance. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761242_1_20240712013345.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shelley Duvall, the versatile actor known for her role in "The Shining" and working relationship with director Robert Altman, died on Thursday aged 75.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citing her partner Dan Gilroy, The Hollywood Reporter said Duvall died in her sleep at her home in Blanco, Texas following complications of diabetes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born July 7, 1949 in Fort Worth, Texas, Duvall was discovered by Altman – the maverick filmmaker known for his rich characters, sharp social criticism and keen satire – who cast her in 1970's dark comedy "Brewster McCloud."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The saucer-eyed actor developed a broad repertoire, breaking through with 1975's "Nashville," and going on to portray memorable and eccentric characters that earned her a smattering of awards including at Cannes for her role in the acclaimed 1977 drama "3 Women."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her career was defined by her work with Altman, who she said she kept working with because "he offers me damn good roles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "None of them have been alike," she told The New York Times in 1977.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn't put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was her role in the film adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" that would become one of her highest profile roles, as she played opposite Jack Nicholson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director Stanley Kubrick put her through the ringer to perform the part of Wendy Torrance in the horror classic that sees a writer husband descend into homicidal madness and terrorise his wife and young son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duvall told People in 1981 the 13-month job was gruelling, and that Kubrick had her "crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will never give that much again. If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one famous scene Nicholson's character tortures Duvall's with a baseball bat, which reportedly took 127 takes to satisfy Kubrick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duvall also made a cameo in 1977's "Annie Hall" by Woody Allen, and played opposite Robin Williams in Altman's 1980 live-action rendition of "Popeye."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later in the 1980s she made her way into children's programming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gilroy – a musician who was part of the Breakfast Club and had dated Madonna – was her longtime partner after the pair met on the 1990 Disney Channel Movie "Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley," The Hollywood Reporter quoted Gilroy as saying. (AFP)
