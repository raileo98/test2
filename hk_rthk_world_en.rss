<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia has attacked cities across Ukraine with a missile barrage that killed more than three dozen people and ripped open a children's hospital in Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of volunteers including hospital staff and rescue workers dug through debris from the Okhmatdyt paediatric hospital in search for survivors after the rare day-time bombardment on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched dozens of missiles toward five towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine as well as the capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 37 people were killed, including three children, with more than 170 wounded, Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strikes damaged nearly 100 buildings, including multiple schools and a maternity hospital, he added. The air force said air defence systems downed 30 projectiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is necessary to shoot down Russian missiles. It is necessary to destroy the Russian combat aircraft on its bases. It is necessary to take strong steps that will not leave any security deficit," Zelensky said ahead of a Nato summit where arming Ukraine's air defences is expected to top the agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council over the barrage and urged Ukraine's allies to deliver "a stronger response" to Russia's attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the strikes, US President Joe Biden on Monday promised "new measures" to boost Ukraine's air defences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together with our allies, we will be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine's air defences to help protect their cities and civilians from Russian strikes," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack spurred a fire at a power substation and at an oil depot in Russia's Volgograd region, the governor of the region in southern Russia said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Air defence and electronic warfare forces suppressed a UAV [unnamed aerial vehicle] attack on the territory of the Volgograd region," Andrei Bocharov, the governor, said in a post published on the Telegram channel of the region's administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of falling UAV debris, fires broke out at a substation in Frolovo and an oil depot in Kalach-on-the-Don." (AFP/Reuters)

    Boeing reaches settlement with regulators over crashes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing's compliance measures and safety have been in the spotlight after a series of incidents, including two 737 MAX crashes. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760776_1_20240709002048.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing said on Monday it had reached a deal with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes, which court papers show would see the aviation giant plead guilty to fraud.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The agreement comes after prosecutors concluded Boeing flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters, in which 346 people were killed in Ethiopia and Indonesia more than five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department," Boeing told AFP in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of crash victims immediately filed an objection to the deal, arguing that it "unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine Berthet, who lost her daughter Camille in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in 2019 -- involving a 737 MAX 8 -- said the deal reflects "weakness and manifest contempt for the victims' families and public interest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Court papers filed in Texas on Sunday said the company had agreed to plead guilty to "conspiracy to defraud the United States" during the certification of MAX airplanes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plea deal sees Boeing avoid a criminal trial, instead agreeing to a series of terms including a US$243.6 million fine on top of the same sum already paid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company will also be required to make a minimum investment of US$455 million in "compliance and safety programs".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such changes at the firm will be overseen by an independent monitor appointed by the government for a three-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company's board of directors will also be required to meet the families of crash victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-profile agreement follows the DOJ finding in May that Boeing failed to improve its compliance and ethics program, in breach of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in the wake of the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The families of victims will ask the court to reject the plea deal at an upcoming hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The generous plea agreement rests on deceptive and offensive premises," said the objection filed by their legal team Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement shared by her lawyers, Berthet added that the agreement shows the DOJ's "deafness" despite an alarming rise in incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021, over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing flouted its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conclusion opened up the company to possible prosecution, with Boeing initially arguing it did not violate the 2021 accord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DOJ representatives briefed families in late June on the proposed plea deal and the company was given until July 5 to accept the offer, or face trial. (AFP)

    World should help Ukraine, Russia resume talks: Xi

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called on the international community to help Ukraine and Russia resume dialogue in a bid to resolve their conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi and visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis in talks in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban briefed Xi on his recent visits to Ukraine and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president stressed an early ceasefire and a political settlement are in the interests of all parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi called on the international community "to create conditions and provide support for the resumption of direct dialogue and negotiation between the two sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted him as saying that "only if all major countries inject positive rather than negative energy, can a ceasefire in this conflict emerge as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Russia and Ukraine, the end of the war “depends on the decision of three world powers, the United States, the European Union and China,” Orban wrote in a Facebook post showing him shaking hands with Xi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Peace mission 3.0” is how Orban captioned a picture posted on the X social media platform depicting him after having stepped off his plane in Beijing earlier on Monday in this previously unannounced visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the EU at the start of July, and Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Orban had come to Moscow as a top representative of the European Council. Several top European officials dismissed that suggestion and said Orban had no mandate for anything beyond a discussion about bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi visited Hungary in May this year for the final leg of a European tour that also took him to France and Serbia. (Agencies)

    Far right blocked but stalemate looms in France

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Supporters of the leftist New Popular Front gather at the Place de la République in Paris to celebrate its strong showing in the polls. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760678_1_20240708123101.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France faced a hung parliament and the prospect of taxing negotiations to form a government, after a surprise left-wing surge blocked Marine Le Pen's quest to bring the far right to power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leftist New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the dominant force in the National Assembly after Sunday's election, but with no single group securing a working majority the possibilities include the NFP forming a minority government or the building of a broad, unwieldy coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result delivered a stinging blow to President Emmanuel Macron and leaves the euro zone's second largest economy in limbo, heralding a period of political instability just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron ended up with a hugely fragmented parliament, in what is set to weaken France's role in the European Union and further afield, and make it hard for anyone to push through a domestic agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left won 182 seats, Macron's centrist alliance 168 and Le Pen's National Rally (RN) and allies 143, interior ministry data cited by Le Monde newspaper showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would tender his resignation, but it was not clear whether the president would accept it immediately, given the daunting task ahead to form a government. Attal said he would be willing to stay on in a caretaker role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will of course do my duties as long as it's needed – it cannot be otherwise on the eve of a date (the Olympics) that is so important for our country," Attal said as it became clear Macron's alliance had endured a humbling setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties from the NFP – made up of the French Communist Party, hard left France Unbowed, the Greens and the Socialist Party – met overnight for first talks on how to proceed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France Unbowed's firebrand leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said the new prime minister should hail from NFP. However, the bloc has no leader and its parties are strongly divided over who they could select as a suitable premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some prominent centrist figures, including Edouard Philippe, a former prime minister under Macron, said they were ready to work on a pact to ensure a stable government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The euro fell on Sunday after the vote projections were announced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's really going to be a vacuum when it comes to France's legislative ability," said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Le Pen's RN, the result was a far cry from weeks during which opinion polls consistently projected it would win comfortably.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left and centrist alliances cooperated after the first round of voting last week by pulling scores of candidates from three-way races to build a unified anti-RN vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first reaction, RN leader Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's protege, called the cooperation between anti-RN forces a "disgraceful alliance" that he said would paralyse France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen, who will likely be the party's candidate for the 2027 presidential election, said however that Sunday's ballot, in which the RN made major gains compared with previous elections, had sown the seeds for the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our victory has been merely delayed," she said. (Reuters)

    June hottest on record: EU climate monitor

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last month was the hottest June on record across the globe, the EU's climate monitor said on Monday, capping half a year of wild and destructive weather from floods to heatwaves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Every month since June 2023 has eclipsed its own temperature record in a 13-month streak of unprecedented global heat, the Copernicus Climate Change Service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is more than a statistical oddity and it highlights a large and continuing shift in our climate," said the service director, Carlo Buontempo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if this specific streak of extremes ends at some point, we are bound to see new records being broken as the climate continues to warm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was "inevitable" as long as humanity kept adding heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The global average temperature notched last month broke the previous June record set in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fresh high came at the midway point of a year marked by climate extremes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scorching heat has blanketed swathes of the world from India to Saudi Arabia, the United States and Mexico in the first half of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relentless rain, a phenomena scientists have also linked to a warmer planet, caused extensive flooding in Kenya, China, Brazil, Afghanistan, Russia and France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires have torched land in Greece and Canada and last week, Hurricane Beryl became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane on record as it barrelled across several Caribbean islands. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday he had arrived in Beijing on "Peace mission 3.0" after recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Orban was greeted at the airport by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, according to a photo he posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His arrival in Beijing follows surprise visits to Russia and Ukraine in the past week since Hungary took over the European Union's rotating presidency at the start of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban, the friendliest EU leader towards Moscow, held talks with President Vladimir Putin on Friday about the war in Ukraine during a trip criticised by both Kyiv and the EU, which said it threatened to undermine the bloc's stance on the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit also came days before a Nato summit that will address further military aid for Ukraine against what the Western defence alliance has called Russia's "unprovoked war of aggression".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a short statement, the Foreign Ministry said the Hungarian leader would meet President Xi Jinping on Monday "for in-depth communication on issues of mutual interest".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary, under Orban, has become an important trade and investment partner for China, in contrast with some other EU nations. (AFP/Reuters)

    Pressure mounts for Joe Biden to step aside

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden, 81, has faced growing calls to end his re-election bid after a halting performance in a June 27 presidential debate. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760617_1_20240708014147.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An embattled US President Joe Biden faced escalating pressure on Sunday from fellow Democrats worried about his candidacy, concerns he aimed to ease with campaign stops in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, has faced growing calls to end his reelection bid after a halting performance in a June 27 debate with Republican Donald Trump, 78, raised questions about his ability to do the job for another four years. He has vowed to stay in the race, dismissing calls for him to drop out as "nonsense" in a fundraising email on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the Democratic president attended a Black church service in Philadelphia and was later due to travel to the state capital, Harrisburg, for an event with union members and local Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coming week is crucial, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said on CNN's "State of the Union." He encouraged the president to try hold a town hall or news conference to convince voters he is "the old Joe Biden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do think the president needs to do more," Murphy said. "I do think the clock is ticking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democrats also suggested that Vice President Kamala Harris, seen as the likeliest candidate to replace Biden in the November 5 election were he to bow out, could perform well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A much-anticipated Biden interview with ABC News on Friday did little to ease concerns of lawmakers and donors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic US Representative Adam Schiff said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that Biden needs to move swiftly to put concerns to rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think she very well could win overwhelmingly, but before we get into a decision about who else it should be, the president needs to make a decision about whether it's him," Schiff said of Harris, a fellow Californian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a meeting on Sunday with senior House Democrats to discuss the president's candidacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Democratic National Committee (DNC) member from Florida, Alan Clendenin, urged Biden to step aside on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Joe Biden will be remembered by historians as one of the finest presidents in American history, but this election is about the next four years, not the last three and a half," Clendenin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DNC has steadfastly supported Biden since his debate stumbles so any defections would suggest a further deepening of the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Friday's interview, Biden said only the "Lord Almighty" could persuade him to drop out, dismissing the prospect that Democratic leaders could join forces to try to talk him into standing down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pennsylvania is one of the half dozen or so states that can swing Democratic or Republican and are expected to determine the outcome of what has been a tight race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunday's trip - Biden's 10th to Pennsylvania during the 2024 election cycle - is part of a July voter outreach blitz by the Democratic Party that includes a US$50 million media campaign aimed at events such as the Olympics and travel by the president, the first lady, Harris and her husband to every battleground state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign said it aims to have volunteers and staff knock on more than 3 million voters' doors in July and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pressure from Congress is expected to steadily increase in the coming days as lawmakers return to Washington from a holiday recess, and donors mull their willingness to keep funding Biden's campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The political crisis is unfolding as Biden prepares to host dozens of world leaders at a high-stakes Nato summit in Washington and hold a rare solo news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five US lawmakers have called for Biden to end his reelection bid, including Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the first Democratic member of the House of Representatives from a battleground district, with others said poised to join in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Given what I saw and heard from the President during last week’s debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the President himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,” Craig, a top 2024 target of House Republican efforts, posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two letters are circulating among House Democrats calling for Biden to step aside, House Democratic sources have said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Senator Mark Warner of Virginia invited fellow senators to a meeting on Monday to discuss Biden's campaign. Biden told reporters he had spoken with 20 congressional Democrats, who urged him to stay on. Biden said he knew of no senators ready to join Warner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senator Bernie Sanders, 82, who has run for the Democratic nomination for president in the past, stood firmly in Biden's camp on Sunday, saying Democrats' focus should be on policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not a beauty contest," he said on CBS' "Face the Nation." (Reuters)

    Pope warns against rise in autocracy, nationalism

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis decried the state of democracy and warned against "populists" during a short visit to Trieste in Italy's northeast on Sunday ahead of a 12-day trip to Asia -- the longest of his papacy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Democracy is not in good health in the world today," Francis said during a speech at the city's convention centre to close a national Catholic event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without naming any countries, the pope warned against "ideological temptations and populists" on the day that France holds the second round of a snap parliamentary vote that looks set to see the far-right National Rally (RN) party take the largest share of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ideologies are seductive. Some people compare them to the Pied Piper of Hamelin: they seduce but lead you to deny yourself," he said in reference to the German fairytale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The culture of rejection creates a city where there is no place for the poor, the unborn, the fragile, the sick, children, women, the young," he regretted, urging facilitation of social participation from childhood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of last month's European parliament elections, bishops in several countries also warned about the rise of populism and nationalism, with far-right parties already holding the reins to power in Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis also urged people to "move away from polarisations that impoverish" and hit out at "self-referential power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Venice in April and Verona in May, the half-day trip to Trieste, a city of 200,000 inhabitants on the Adriatic Sea that borders Slovenia, marked the third one within Italy this year for the 87-year-old pontiff, who has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since travelling to the French city of Marseille in September 2023, the Argentine Jesuit has limited himself to domestic travel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he plans to spend nearly two weeks in Asia in September visiting Indonesia, Singapore and the islands of Papua New Guinea and East Timor. (AFP)

    High turnout seen as French head to the polls

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A man enters a polling booth to vote in the second round of France's legislative election at a polling station in Le Touquet. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760600_1_20240707183824.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French voters turned out in number on Sunday for the second round of a historic election that is expected to leave the far right as the biggest force in a deeply divided parliament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At midday, according to interior ministry figures, some 26.63 percent of voters had turned out for the high-stakes poll -- the highest number at that time since 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mood in France is tense, with 30,000 police deployed to head off trouble and voters anxious about a potential electoral earthquake shifting the French political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the village of Rosheim, outside the eastern city of Strasbourg, an "anguished" 72-year-old Antoine Schrameck said he feared France would see "a turning point in the history of the republic".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Tourcoing, near the northeast city of Lille, 66-year-old retiree Laurence Abbad said she feared violence after the results are announced. "There's so much tension, people are going mad," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections three years ahead of time after his forces were trounced in June's European parliament vote, a gamble which seems to have backfired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) came top in the June 30 first round, and is on course to repeat the feat in Sunday's run off races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she may not win the outright majority that would force Macron to appoint Le Pen's lieutenant, the RN party leader Jordan Bardella, 28, as prime minister just weeks before Paris hosts the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hung parliament with a large eurosceptic, anti-immigration contingent could weaken France's international standing and threaten Western unity in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Union officials, already learning to deal with far-right parties in power in Italy and the Netherlands, are watching France closely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Rome, Pope Francis chose the day of the French vote to warn against "ideological temptations and populists", adding: "Democracy is not in good health in the world today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the country on tenterhooks, last week saw more than 200 tactical-voting pacts between centre and left wing candidates in seats to attempt to prevent the RN winning an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This has been hailed as a return of the anti-far right "Republican Front" first summoned when Le Pen's father Jean-Marie faced Jacques Chirac in the run-off of 2002 presidential elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls now forecast that the RN will fall well short of the 289 seats needed for an outright majority in the 577-seat National Assembly, while still becoming the largest party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such an outcome could allow Macron to possibly build a broad coalition against the RN and keep Gabriel Attal as prime minister on a caretaker basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it could also herald a long period of paralysed politics in France, as it prepares to host the Olympics from July 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many in France remain baffled over why Macron called an election that could end with the RN doubling its presence in parliament and his contingent of centrist MPs halving in number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the president, known for his theatrical gestures, appears intent on executing what he calls a "clarification" of French politics, which he hopes will eventually leave three clear camps of far right, centre and hard left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final opinion polls published by two organisations on Friday projected the RN would win between 170 to 210 seats, followed by the New Popular Front (NFP) broad left-wing coalition on 145 to 185 and Macron's centrists on 118 to 150.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Macron's Ensemble alliance is forecast to come third, the more successful NFP is a fragile mix of several warring factions ranging from traditional Socialists to the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) of firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "France is on the cusp of a seismic political shift," said analysts at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), warning that even if Macron controlled the government after the election he would face "legislative gridlocks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would weaken "France's voice on the European and international stage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After voting began on Saturday in France's overseas territories, polls opened in mainland France at 0600 GMT and were due to close by 1800 GMT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Projections -- which usually give a very close idea of the final outcome -- are published shortly afterwards, with the political leaders then reacting rapidly to any frenzy that grips the nation. (AFP)

    Biden remains defiant in TV interview

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden's presidential reelection bid hung in the balance Saturday, after his latest efforts to put a disastrous debate showing behind him failed to silence voices urging him to quit the White House race.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Murmurs of dissent within his own Democratic Party have -- in the case of five individual House representatives -- morphed into direct calls for him to drop out. And a number of key donors have threatened to cut off funding if Biden insists on staying the course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump," Angie Craig, the latest House Democrat to break ranks, said Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has scheduled a virtual meeting of senior Democrat representatives for Sunday to discuss the best way forward, and Democrat Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the upper chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what had been billed as a make-or-break TV interview on Friday, Biden's strategy was to flatly deny the falling poll numbers and concerns over his mental and physical fitness triggered by his dismal performance against rival Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed a severe cold for the debate debacle and insisted it was just a "bad night" rather than evidence of increasing frailty and cognitive decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the 81-year-old was adamant that he would not be pressured to end his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race," he said. "But the Lord Almighty is not coming down."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calls for less divine intervention do, however, appear to be strengthening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's campaign team is pushing ahead regardless, with two events planned in Pennsylvania on Sunday and visits to other battleground states later in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a rally in Wisconsin before Friday's interview, Biden had delivered a forceful, energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then came the sit-down with the ABC network that appeared unlikely to soothe the concerns of critics who say that -- away from a teleprompter -- Biden can struggle to communicate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of his answers were tentative, meandering and difficult to follow, even as he sought to deflect questions about his mental acuity and dismissed the notion that his party would consider replacing him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign had another small fire to put out Saturday after it emerged that the White House had provided the questions for interviews the president gave to two Black radio stations on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic strategist David Axelrod suggested in a CNN op-ed that Biden is engaged in "Denial. Delusion. Defiance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The stakes are as great as Biden describes. And if he believes it, as I think he does, he will eventually do what duty and love of country requires, and step aside," Axelrod wrote in the piece published Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If he does not, it will be Biden's age, and not Trump's moral and ethical void, that will dominate the rest of this most important campaign and sully the president's historic legacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, meanwhile, sarcastically suggested Biden should "ignore his many critics and move forward, with alacrity and strength."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He should be sharp, precise and energetic, just like he was in The Debate," the Republican challenger said in a social media post Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, Democrats are largely keeping a lid on any simmering discontent with their leader -- at least in public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with election day just four months away, any move to replace Biden as nominee would need to be made sooner rather than later, and the meetings of top Congressional Democrats in coming days will be scrutinized for any signs of more open rebellion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, for Biden and his campaign team, the strategy seems to be to ride it out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His next major test will be a press conference scheduled for Thursday during the NATO leaders' summit in Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When pressed in the ABC interview on why he doesn't take an independent neurological exam, Biden argued that the role of US president meant being subjected to constant mental assessment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have a cognitive test every single day," he said. "Not only am I campaigning, I'm running the world." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Saturday prepared for its most consequential legislative election of recent times, with residents of overseas territories opening voting for a poll expected to give the far right its biggest ever presence in parliament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A traditional final day pause was observed on Saturday ahead of Sunday's second round runoff after a frenetic campaign that saw tensions rise across the country and dozens of attacks on candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Underlining France's global footprint that spans the oceans of the world, the first French region to vote was Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a small French archipelago off the coast of Canada where citizens began voting from 1000 GMT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were to be followed on Saturday by residents of French Caribbean territories including Martinique and Guadeloupe as well as Guiana in South America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Pacific territories come next before people in mainland France cast their ballots from 0600 GMT on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls will close by 1800 GMT on Sunday when projections of seat numbers -- regarded in France as a firm indicator of the final outcome -- are published.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Final opinion polls on Friday suggested that far-right leader Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) would fall short of winning an outright majority in the National Assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Emmanuel Macron's gamble in calling snap elections is expected to end with his centrist alliance having half the number of deputies it had before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He now faces the final three years of his presidency with no clear ruling majority, and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal perhaps trying to hold together a caretaker government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today the danger is a majority dominated by the extreme right and that would be catastrophic," Attal said in a final pre-election interview with French television on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen insists that she is still on course for victory and an absolute majority that would force Macron to appoint her 28-year-old lieutenant Jordan Bardella as prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Attal vowed to stay on "as long as necessary" in a caretaker role, while Macron's office is studying options to maintain some form of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron is to remain in office until presidential and legislative elections in April 2027, but he must now face the possibility of sharing power with political foes. (AFP)

    New UK PM Starmer 'restless for change' after win

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly elected UK prime minister Keir Starmer on Saturday began his first full day in charge declaring himself "restless for change" and pledging that growth would be his Labour government's "number one mission".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Starmer also confirmed his previously declared intention to end the outgoing Conservative government's flagship scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started... I'm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don't act as a deterrent," he told reporters following his first cabinet meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party on Friday won a landslide election victory, bringing to a close 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour leader told his top team, including Britain's first woman finance minister Rachel Reeves and new foreign minister David Lammy, it had been "the honour and the privilege of my life" to be invited by King Charles III to form the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a huge amount of work to do, so now we get on with our work," he said to applause and smiles around the cabinet table.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer spent his first hours in Downing Street on Friday appointing his ministerial team, hours after securing his centre-left party's return to power with a whopping 174-seat majority in the UK parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notable lower-ranking appointments included Patrick Vallance, chief scientific government adviser during the Covid-19 pandemic, who has been made a science minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  James Timpson, whose shoe repair company employs ex-offenders, was also made a prisons minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both would be given seats in the upper house of parliament in order to join the government as neither is an elected lawmaker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said both new ministers were people "associated with change" and illustrated his determination to deliver concrete improvements to people's lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm restless for change, and I think and hope that what you've already seen demonstrates that," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flag-waving crowds of cheering Labour activists on Friday had welcomed Starmer to Downing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But daunting challenges await his government, including a stagnating economy, creaking public services and households suffering from a years-long cost-of-living crisis. (AFP)

 Iran's reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday won a runoff presidential election against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, the interior ministry said.

  Pezeshkian received more than 16 million votes and Jalili more than 13 million out of about 30 million votes cast, electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said, adding that voter turnout stood at 49.8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of spoiled ballots was reported to be over 600,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian said the vote was the start of a "partnership" with the Iranian people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The difficult path ahead will not be smooth except with your companionship, empathy, and trust. I extend my hand to you," Pezeshkian said in a post on social media platform X, after on Tuesday saying he would "extend the hand of friendship to everyone" if he won.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, followed a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority, had called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act "against the system".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ballot comes against a backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme, and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist allowed to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with around 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part in the first round -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with endorsements by former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, a moderate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for "constructive relations" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to "get Iran out of its isolation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jalili, 58, is Iran's former nuclear negotiator who is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his campaign, he rallied a substantial base of hardline supporters and received backing from other conservative figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Friday's runoff, Pezeshkian and Jalili took part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pezeshkian vowed to ease long-standing internet restrictions and to "fully" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping congratulated reformist Masoud Pezeshkian for his win in Iran's presidential runoff election, state media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I attach great importance to the development of China-Iran relations and am willing to work with the President to lead the China-Iran comprehensive strategic partnership towards deeper advancement," state news agency Xinhua reported Xi as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries "have a long history of friendly exchanges, and bilateral relations have maintained healthy and stable development... for over half a century," Xi said, according to Xinhua.(AFP)

    Firefighters struggle to contain California blazes

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 California firefighters battled multiple blazes in record heat on Friday, with a new fire breaking out near the famous Yosemite National Park even as a larger inferno further north came under control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Temperatures up to 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees Celsius) were recorded in the western US state on Friday, as the region's latest heat wave nears its peak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Dangerous heat is likely to become more widespread in the West today and Saturday... Temperatures will be 15-30 degrees above average for much of the West Coast today," warned the National Weather Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or broken," the NWS said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The excessive heat comes on the July 4 weekend, when millions of Americans celebrate the anniversary of their nation's independence with displays of fireworks that can spark blazes in hot, dry conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fast-moving fire erupted just outside Yosemite National Park late on Thursday, causing large parts of the former Gold Rush town of Mariposa to be evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Friday afternoon, the fire had burnt nearly 405 hectares and was 15 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Winds have calmed which has helped firefighters make progress overnight," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some residents had been allowed to return to their homes. The fire's cause was not yet known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was also progress in northern California, where earlier this week thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Thompson Fire near Oroville.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some of the region's highest temperatures, firefighters reported success in containing the blaze, with some evacuation orders lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, fire officials and forecasters warned that the danger is far from over, with high temperatures expected to spread further and to peak Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week," warned the NWS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate scientists say the western US is undergoing a decades-long aridification as weather patterns change, at least in part because of human-caused global warming. (AFP)

    'I was sick. I was feeling terrible' - Biden

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Campaign officials have resisted suggestions that President Biden may withdraw from the presidential race. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760477_1_20240706090231.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden vowed on Friday to stay in the White House race and blamed his dismal debate performance on "feeling terrible" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign with a make-or-break TV interview.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As rebellion brews among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old's long career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong," the president said in an excerpt of his first TV interview since the debate with Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden sounded raspy and gave meandering answers in the clip, which appeared unlikely to reassure Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trump campaign offered a lightning-quick mocking reaction, posting on X that "Biden sounds great!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sit-down -- which was due to be aired in full later Friday, came after Biden's debate in Atlanta triggered panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, "I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As supporters cheered, he went on the attack against his rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's focus on what really matters," Biden said, reading from tele-prompters. "We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least three Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have several major newspapers and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wealthy Disney heiress and Democratic supporter Abigail Disney, told CNBC she plans to withhold donations to the party until Biden drops out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose (in November)", she said. "This is realism, not disrespect," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senate Intelligence Committee chariman Mark Warner has approached fellow Democrats to organize talks on Monday on Biden's path forward, multiple US media outlets reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was convening his own meeting -- a video call with senior Democrats -- on Sunday, according to NBC News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it "essential" he do more major interviews to prove himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has announced he will hold a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next Thursday, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the Nato meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the American Southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president will "engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign," his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an "all-on discussion," saying he was ready "anytime, anywhere, any place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With speculation swirling over a potential switch in the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 59-year-old former prosecutor has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading alternative if he steps aside. (AFP)

    Deadline looms for beleaguered Boeing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are assembled at the company’s plant in Renton, Washington. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760474_1_20240706084446.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than five years after two fatal 737 MAX crashes, Boeing faces a fresh legal reckoning now that prosecutors have concluded the company flouted an earlier settlement addressing the disasters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The aviation giant had been on a Friday night deadline to accept or reject a Department of Justice proposal that would require it to plead guilty to fraud during the certification of MAX airplanes, sources told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been no public comment either way by the evening, and a lawyer for the families of the 737 crash victims, Robert Clifford, told AFP that he believed the deadline would be extended over the weekend if Boeing asked for more time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's latest legal predicament was triggered by a DOJ determination in mid-May that the company ignored a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) by not meeting requirements to improve its compliance and ethics program after the MAX crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under a proposal presented by the DOJ to families of MAX crash victims, Boeing would pay an additional US$243 million penalty and agree to have an external monitor, said Tracy Brammeier, an attorney at Clifford Law who represents families of MAX victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The guilty plea is significant. No one wants to be a convicted or admitted felon," said Brammeier, who nonetheless described family members as dissatisfied with the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a US court on how it will proceed no later than July 7, with the agency expected to announce steps to prosecute Boeing should the company reject the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing, which has previously said it honoured the terms of the DPA, declined comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The original DPA was announced in January 2021 near the end of the Trump administration over charges that Boeing knowingly defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification of the MAX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement required Boeing to pay US$2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year probationary period was set to expire this year. But in January, Boeing was plunged back into crisis mode when a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines was forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out mid-flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a May 14 letter to the US court, DOJ officials said that Boeing breached its obligations under the DPA by "failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families of victims, who have pressed for a criminal trial of Boeing and its top executives, remain unhappy that the new plea agreement does not explicitly link Boeing's fraud to the 346 fatalities from crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, according to Brammeier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The families want accountability and still are not getting it," Brammeier said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash, said the DOJ should also impose much stiffer fines on Boeing -- from US$10 billion to US$20 billion -- with the caveat that they could be suspended if the company invests in safety and quality control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's too good a deal for Boeing," said Stumo, who added that Boeing should not have a say in who is appointed its independent monitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miriam Baer, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School, said the DOJ's decision to stick with the original charge -- rather than supplement it -- reflects a desire to "bring the claims that could be most easily proven if it goes to trial."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, said DPAs like Boeing's often "poorly serve" the public interest because "prosecutors probably care much more about achieving a conviction than ensuring the defendant is adequately deterred and restrained," he wrote in a blog post this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coffee suggested the DOJ should consider measures such as barring CEO compensation models that encourage risk-taking, or ensuring that funds clawed back from executives who plead guilty of wrongdoing go to whistleblowers as a way "to shift some of the cost of deterrence from shareholders to senior management." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday said positions in the Ukraine war were "far apart" and "many" steps would be needed to end the conflict after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I have found that positions are far apart. The number of steps needed to end the war and bring about peace are many," the Hungarian leader told a press conference alongside Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in terms of dialogue and restoring dialogue, the first important step has been taken today and I will continue this work," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin told Orban that Ukraine must abandon four regions in the east and south that Moscow claims as its own if Kyiv wants peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about the full withdrawal of all troops from the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, and from the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions," Putin said in televised remarks after what he called a "frank and useful" conversation with Orban in Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban informed Nato ahead of his visit to Moscow, alliance head Jens Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, Viktor Orban is not representing Nato at these meetings. He's representing his own country," Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hungary agrees that Russia is responsible for the war. Russia is the perpetrator, and Russia can end this war today by stopping attacking Ukraine," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban unsettled the European Union and Nato allies by flying to Moscow to sit down for talks with Putin, with whom he has long fostered friendly relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said he viewed Orban as a representative for Europe, despite EU leaders emphasising that Orban was acting on his own initiative in an exclusively bilateral role with no mandate to speak for the bloc. (AFP)

    Starmer pledges to rebuild UK after election win

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Keir Starmer speaks at a reception in London to celebrate the Labour victory. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760411_1_20240705174724.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer vowed to rebuild Britain as its next prime minister after his Labour Party on Friday surged to a landslide victory in a parliamentary election, ending 14 years of Conservative government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre-left Labour won a massive majority in the 650-seat parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rishi Sunak's Conservatives suffered the worst performance in the party's long history as voters punished them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services and a series of scandals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did it," Starmer said in a victory speech. "Change begins now... We said we would end the chaos, and we will, we said we would turn the page, and we have. Today, we start the next chapter, begin the work of change, the mission of national renewal and start to rebuild our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election result has upended British politics. Labour won some 410 seats, an increase of 210, while the Conservatives, the western world's most successful party, lost about 250 lawmakers, including a record number of senior ministers and former Prime Minister Liz Truss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Scottish National Party imploded, losing 38 seats, ending its own decade of dominance in Scotland and leaving its dream of independence for Scotland in tatters, while conversely the Irish nationalists Sinn Fein became Northern Ireland's largest party for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the populist right-wing Reform UK party, headed by Nigel Farage, the Brexit campaigner and friend of Donald Trump, won more than four million votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While it secured only four lawmakers, its impact on the outcome by siphoning vast tracts of Conservative support will make Farage a major thorn in the side of the two major parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A glum Sunak conceded defeat and will meet King Charles later to formally resign before Starmer is appointed in his place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today power will change hands in a peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides," Sunak said. "There is much to learn and reflect on and I take responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative candidates... I am sorry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite his convincing victory, polls have suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party. Thanks to the quirk of Britain's first past the post system and a low turnout, Labour's triumph was achieved with fewer votes than it secured in 2017 and 2019, the latter its worst result for 84 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pound and British stocks and government bonds rose on Friday, but Starmer comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, have already been scaled back while Starmer has promised not to raise taxes for "working people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Likewise, he has promised to scrap the Conservative's controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but with migration a key electoral issue, he will be under pressure himself to find a way to stop tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel from France on small boats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't promise you it will be easy," Starmer said. "Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. It's hard work. Patient, determined, work, and we will have to get moving immediately." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's main opposition Labour party looks set for a landslide election win, exit polls indicated on Thursday, ending 14 years of right-wing Conservative rule marked by financial austerity, Brexit division and scandal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As polling stations closed at 10:00 pm (2100 GMT), the survey for UK broadcasters suggested centre-left Labour would win 410 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons, with the Tories (Conservatives) managing only 131.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another boost for the centrists, the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats would get 61 seats, but Nigel Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK could secure 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Counting of ballots was under way across the country, with official results expected from late on Thursday into Friday, putting Labour leader Keir Starmer on course to replace Rishi Sunak as prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result, if confirmed, bucks a rightward trend among Britain's closest allies, with the far-right National Rally in France eyeing power and Donald Trump looking set for a return in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, a party needs 326 seats to win an overall majority in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a sleepless night of counting and declarations, the winner is expected to meet head of state King Charles, who will ask the leader of the largest party to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministerial appointments are expected to follow soon after an acceptance speech to a mass of assembled media in Downing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Confirmation of the result would cap a remarkable rise to power for Starmer, 61, who was first elected as a member of parliament in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former human rights lawyer and chief public prosecutor was elected Labour leader in early 2020, succeeding the veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn, who lost by a landslide to Boris Johnson in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, he has dragged the party back to the centre ground, making it a more electable proposition and purging ideological infighting and anti-Semitism that lost it support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls have given Labour a consistent 20-point lead over the Tories for almost the past two years, which a largely lacklustre election campaign has failed to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That has given an air of inevitability about a Labour win, and high expectations that the party can fulfil its promise to change the country's flagging fortunes for the better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer – the working-class son of a toolmaker and a nurse – has promised "a decade of national renewal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his to-do list is daunting, with economic growth anaemic, public services overstretched and underfunded after nearly a decade-and-a-half of cuts, and households squeezed financially.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour leader has also promised a return of political integrity, after a chaotic period of five Tory prime ministers, including three in four months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His first days in office are set to be packed, representing Britain at the Nato conference in Washington next week, then hosting European leaders later this month at a summit in southern England. (AFP)

    Mexico girds for hit from Hurricane Beryl

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourist resorts in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula girded on Thursday for a hit from Hurricane Beryl, which is still packing ferocious winds after slamming Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beryl dropped to a Category 2 storm, with winds of 175 kilometres per hour, and was expected to weaken further as it headed towards landfall overnight on Thursday into Friday on the peninsula, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of mid-afternoon on Thursday it was in the Caribbean about 445 kilometres east of Tulum, which is about a two-hour drive from Cancun – the two main resort cities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm already left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela, killing at least seven people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first hurricane since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach the highest Category 5 in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Mexico, classes in the area bracing for a hit were suspended and shelters were set up for locals and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Cancun, people have been stocking up on food and other essentials for days and hotels have boarded up their windows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl is expected to hit the Yucatan Peninsula, emerge over the Gulf of Mexico, then arrive in the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hurricane has already caused flash floods and mudslides in the Cayman Islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was "pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit," he said on Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Thursday he has agreed to send a delegation for talks on securing the release of hostages seized in the October 7 attacks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement after telephone talks with US President Joe Biden, Netanyahu's office said: "The prime minister updated President Biden about his decision to send a delegation that would continue negotiations for freeing the hostages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no indication where the delegation would go or when it would leave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its own readout of the phone call, the White House said Biden welcomed the decision to have Israeli negotiators "engage" with mediators in a bid "to close out the deal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu called a meeting of his security cabinet for later on Thursday to discuss new proposals sent by Hamas through Qatari mediators, media reports said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has demanded an end to the fighting and an Israeli withdrawal as a prelude to any hostage deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has countered that there can be no end to the war without the release of hostages in the Palestinian territory. Netanyahu has also repeatedly vowed that the Gaza campaign will not end until Hamas's military and government capabilities have been destroyed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said late on Wednesday that it had sent new "ideas" for a potential deal and Netanyahu's office said the government was "evaluating" them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been mediating between the two sides and sources close to their efforts said there had been a renewed push to bridge the "gaps" between the foes in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden announced a pathway to a truce deal in May which he said had been proposed by Israel and which included a six-week truce to allow for talks and eventually a programme to rebuild devastated Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are important developments in the latest proposals with positive options for both sides," said a diplomat briefed on the latest proposals. "This time the Americans are very serious about this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war started with the October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Lebanon's Hezbollah rains 200 rockets on Israel

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760307_1_20240705005441.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a barrage of more than 200 rockets and drones at Israeli army positions on Thursday as tensions soared amid the almost nine-month-old war raging in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Iran-backed militant group said its latest attack, which followed over 100 rockets fired the previous day, came in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in south Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel reported no deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with strikes in southern Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears of an escalation into all-out war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres voiced concern on Wednesday "about the escalation of the exchange of fire," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, warning of the risk to the wider Middle East "if we were to find ourselves in a full-fledged conflict."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah and Hamas are part of an Iran-led "Axis of Resistance" against Israel and the United States, a regional alliance that also includes Yemen's Houthi rebels and armed groups in Iraq and Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military confirmed Hezbollah claims that over 200 rockets were launched on Thursday and said that its forces were "striking launch posts in southern Lebanon" in response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli air defences intercepted most incoming rockets, and the only reported casualty was a man slightly wounded by shrapnel, while some of the impacts sparked wildfires.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel killed senior Hezbollah commander Mohammed Naameh Nasser with a strike in the Lebanese coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source close to the group described him as "responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon." His death came after an Israeli strike in June killed Taleb Abdallah, who headed another sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at Nasser's funeral, top Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned Israel against "imagining that targeting these heroes would ever leave the south exposed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When any leader becomes a martyr, another takes up the banner and proceeds with new, firm and strong resolve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border. (AFP)

    British teacher jailed for sex with schoolboys

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A British teacher who had sex with two teenage students and had a baby with one of them was sentenced on Thursday to six and a half years in jail.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rebecca Joynes, 30, was on police bail for sexual activity with one victim, identified as Boy A, when she began having sex with the second, Boy B, by whom she became pregnant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing Joynes, a judge said she had been a "high achiever" who had thrown her career away and had her baby taken away from her through her own actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joynes groomed the schoolboys from the age of 15, exchanging messages on social media before engaging in sexual activity, prosecutors told the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was found guilty by a jury of six counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, including two while being in a position of trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither of the boys can be identified by name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence at Manchester Crown Court in northwestern England, Judge Kate Cornell told the former teacher she had behaved with "breathtaking arrogance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You were the person in control, the person who should have known better," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Instead, you abused that position of trust and exploited the privileged role for your own sexual gratification."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement to the court, Boy B said he had been "coerced and controlled, manipulated, sexually abused, and mentally abused" by Joynes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court previously heard that when police opened an investigation into her relationship with Boy A, she was warned not to have unsupervised contact with anyone under 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she then began a relationship with Boy B and later gave birth to his child. The baby was removed from her care within 24 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside court, Detective Constable Beth Alexander said there was still a lack of understanding about men and boys being the victims of sexual offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have had to read comments stating others are 'jealous' of them, and that they should be 'happy a young female teacher was interested in them', and this rhetoric is very damaging and dangerous", she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women can still be paedophiles. This term is not reserved only for men. Men and boys can still be victims of sexual abuse," she said. (AFP)

    'Japan's forced sterilisation law unconstitutional'

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Around 16,500 people were forcibly sterilised under the law that aimed to "prevent the generation of poor quality descendants." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760168_1_20240704055209.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's top court ruled on Wednesday that a defunct eugenics law under which thousands of people were forcibly sterilised between 1948 and 1996 was unconstitutional.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Supreme Court also declared that a 20-year statute of limitations could not be applied, paving the way for compensation claims from victims after years of legal battles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the state to evade responsibility for damages payments would be extremely unfair and unjust, and absolutely intolerable," the court in Tokyo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan's government acknowledges that around 16,500 people were forcibly sterilised under the law that aimed to "prevent the generation of poor quality descendants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An additional 8,500 people were sterilised with their consent, although lawyers say even those cases were likely "de facto forced" because of the pressure individuals faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 1953 government notice said physical restraint, anaesthesia and even "deception" could be used for the operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are people who couldn't be here today. There are those who died as well. I want to visit the grave of my parents and tell them we've won," victim Saburo Kita, who uses a pseudonym, told reporters after the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kita was convinced to undergo a vasectomy when he was 14 at a facility housing troubled children. He only told his wife what had happened shortly before she died in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But a complete resolution of this issue hasn't been realised yet. Together with lawyers, I will continue to fight," said Kita, one of several victims who celebrated outside the court, some in wheelchairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of operations in Japan slowed to a trickle in the 1980s and 1990s before the law was scrapped in 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That dark history was thrust back under the spotlight in 2018 when a woman in her 60s sued the government over a procedure she had undergone at age 15, opening the floodgates for similar lawsuits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government, for its part, "wholeheartedly" apologised after legislation was passed in 2019 stipulating a lump-sum payment of 3.2 million yen (around US$20,000 today) per victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, survivors say that was too little to match the severity of their suffering and took their fight to court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional courts have mostly agreed in recent years that the eugenics law was a violation of Japan's constitution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, judges have been divided on whether claims are valid beyond the 20-year statute of limitations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some ordered the state to pay damages but others dismissed cases, saying the window for pursuing damages had closed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the government would "swiftly pay damages based on the finalised ruling" and discuss "the new ways in which (victims) can be compensated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government "sincerely apologises" for the policy that "trampled on the human dignity" of victims, Kishida said, adding he would meet survivors in coming weeks to listen "face-to-face to their stories of suffering."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A group of victims said on Wednesday it "wholeheartedly" welcomed the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot forgive the irresponsibility of the government and its lack of human rights awareness, as well as the fact that what is now described as the biggest human rights violation in Japan's post-war history was left unaddressed for such a long time," the group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawyer Koji Niizato said it was "the best ruling we could have hoped for."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victims of the eugenics law put up a wonderful fight, one that influenced the Supreme Court and changed society," Niizato said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden is "absolutely not" pulling out of the White House race, his spokeswoman said on Wednesday, as pressure mounted on the veteran Democrat following his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old Biden has told a key ally he must convince the public quickly that he can do the job, The New York Times and CNN reported, raising the stakes for Biden's first post-debate TV interview, scheduled for Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He knows if he has two more events like that, we're in a different place," the ally said, discussing the president's poor showing against his Republican predecessor last week, according to the Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House quickly rejected the reporting as false.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Democratic establishment figures have voiced bafflement over what they see as deflection and excuses from the president and his aides after his often incoherent debate performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Congress, lawmakers see Democratic prospects of taking over the House of Representatives, hanging on to the Senate and returning to the White House slipping away, four months ahead of the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The concern was compounded by a new New York Times poll conducted after the debate that showed Trump with his biggest lead ever over Biden – 49 percent to 43 percent of likely voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other post-debate polling by progressive non-profit OpenLabs found that New Hampshire, Virginia and New Mexico – all once safe Biden states – are now in play for Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn't until Tuesday – five days after the debate – that Biden called House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and congressional staffers have been voicing consternation over the glacial pace of the outreach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are getting to the point where it may not have been the debate that did him in, but the aftermath of how they've handled it," a senior Democratic operative told Washington political outlet Axios.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is "absolutely not" withdrawing from the race, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday, adding he is "moving forward" with his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aware of growing alarm in the party, Biden scheduled a meeting with all 23 Democratic governors on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will make his pitch in the swing states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the coming days, and sit with ABC News on Friday for his first interview since the debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president has cited fatigue as a new explanation for his poor showing, saying that he had been unwise to travel "around the world a couple times" before the debate and "almost fell asleep on stage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he had been back in the United States for nearly two weeks and spent two days relaxing and six in debate preparation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Times said people who have interacted with the president had found that his mental fogginess was "growing more frequent, more pronounced and more worrisome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic lawmakers have begun to go public with their doubts, with two saying on Tuesday they expected Biden to lose to Trump in November and another calling for him to quit the White House race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Big names in the House of Representatives who are usually foursquare behind Biden – including Nancy Pelosi and James Clyburn – have acknowledged that questions over his condition are fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  House Democrats vented their frustration during a video call on Tuesday, although some reportedly cautioned against changing leaders so close to the August nominating convention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fundamental issue, of course, isn't the campaign. It's not the Biden family. And it's not even last week's debate," political analyst and prominent Trump critic Bill Kristol wrote on Wednesday for conservative outlet The Bulwark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the fitness of the president to be president – not for a few more months, but for four more years." (AFP)

    World's oldest artwork discovered in Indonesian cave

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1760146_1_20240703233054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It may not look like much – just a flaking image of three people around a big red pig.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the humble cave painting discovered in Indonesia is the oldest known narrative artwork ever made by human hands, dating back more than 51,000 years, new research said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the oldest evidence of storytelling," said Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist at Australia's Griffith University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aubert was part of the team that identified the previous record holder in 2019, a hunting scene found in a nearby Indonesian cave then estimated to be nearly 44,000 years old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest discovery, which was dated using a new laser technique, marks "the first time we've passed the 50,000-year barrier," said Aubert, a co-author of a new study in Nature describing the find.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That early humans were able to tell such a "sophisticated" story through art could rewrite our understanding of human cognitive evolution, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our discovery suggests that storytelling was a much older part of human history... than previously thought," study co-author archaeologist Adam Brumm told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the discovery, the researchers used a new method that uses lasers and computer software to create a "map" of rock samples.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This laser ablation technique is more precise, easier, quicker, cheaper, and requires much smaller rock samples than the previous uranium series method, Aubert said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team first tested the new technique on the previous record holder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It determined that the hunting scene was actually at least 48,000 years old – 4,000 years older than the uranium series method determined in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team then tried the laser method out on a previously undated painting first spotted in a cave on Indonesia's Sulawesi island in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was found to to be least 51,200 years old, smashing the previous record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The painting, which is in poor condition, shows three people around a wild pig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't know exactly what they're doing," Aubert admitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He speculated that the paintings were likely made by the first group of humans who moved through Southeast Asia before arriving in Australia around 65,000 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's probably just a matter of time before we find samples that are older," Aubert added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Humans first evolved in Africa more than 300,000 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first images known to have been made by humans are simple lines and patterns made in ochre found in South Africa dating back 100,000 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But then there is a "huge gap" in human art until the Indonesian cave paintings 50,000 years later, Aubert said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The question is, why is it not everywhere?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One theory is that artwork elsewhere did not survive all those millennia. Another is that ancient art could still be out there waiting to be discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously the first narrative art was thought to have emerged in Europe. A "lion man" statue found in Germany has been dated to around 40,000 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The date given for the Indonesian cave art is "quite provocative" because it is so much older than what has been found elsewhere, including in Europe, said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at London's Natural History Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stringer, who was not involved in the research, said the experienced team's findings looked sound but needed to be confirmed by further dating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In my view this find reinforces the idea that representational art was first produced in Africa, before 50,000 years ago, and the concept spread as our species spread," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that is true, much new supporting evidence from other areas including Africa has yet to emerge..." (AFP)

    Hurricane Beryl bears down on Jamaica

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beryl barrels towards Jamaica, with forecasters warning of potentially deadly winds and storm surge.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Powerful Hurricane Beryl churned towards Jamaica on Wednesday with dangerous winds and sea surge, as residents hunkered down against a storm that has killed seven people and caused destruction in the Caribbean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hurricane – unusually strong so early in the Atlantic season – was expected to pass near or over Jamaica by midday as a life-threatening Category 4 storm, meteorologists said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl is the first storm since US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Across Jamaica, people removed boats from the water and tied them to fences for safety and rushed to buy food, water, petrol and other essentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of Wednesday morning the storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 235 kilometres per hour, said the NHC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared an island-wide 6 am to 6 pm curfew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Desmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has tried to be ready.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're doing the usual, removing all objects that can cause damage," he told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment – including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do," Brown said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain from the outer bands of Beryl started pounding Jamaica overnight on Tuesday into Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hurricane warnings were also issued in the Cayman Islands further west, which Beryl was expected to pass near or over on Wednesday night or early on Thursday, according to the NHC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall on Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela. (AFP)

    Category 5 Hurricane Beryl kills 5, threatens Jamaica

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hurricane Beryl was hurtling towards Jamaica on Tuesday as a monster Category 5 storm, after killing at least five people and causing widespread destruction in a deadly sweep across the southeastern Caribbean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Though expected to weaken slightly later on Tuesday, the hurricane is still on track to slam into Jamaica on Wednesday as a "near-major" storm, bringing life-threatening winds, storm surge, rain and flash flooding, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl has already razed parts of the southeastern Caribbean as a Category 4 storm, killing at least three people in Grenada, one in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and one in Venezuela, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Prime Minister of Grenada, Dickon Mitchell, said the island of Carriacou – which the NHC said took a direct hit from the storm – has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened by 90 kilometres per hour winds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've had virtually no communication with Carriacou in the last 12 hours except briefly this morning by satellite phone," he told a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 35-square kilometre island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family of UN climate chief Simon Stiell is among the residents of Carriacou. His office said his parents' property was damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 90 percent of the homes along with the airport on Union Island, in St Vincent, have also been damaged or destroyed, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said. The three-square mile island has a population of around 3,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonsalves said the storm also killed one person on another island, Bequia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl "has left in its wake immense destruction, pain and suffering," he said in a Facebook video late on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One man also died when swept away by a flooded river in the state of Sucre on Venezuela's northeastern coast, officials there said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barbados appeared to have been spared the worst but was still hit with high winds and pelting rain, although officials reported no injuries so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martinique was also largely spared, with damage to boats and some flooding in downtown Fort-de-France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts say it is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl is the first hurricane since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June, and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July. (AFP)

    Candidates exit French runoff to block far right

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Marine Le Pen says her far-right National Rally party will try to form a government even without an absolute majority.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates pulled out of France's legislative election runoff by a Tuesday deadline, in a move President Emmanuel Macron hopes will block the far right from winning power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France votes on Sunday in the final round of snap legislative polls Macron called seeking a "clarification" in politics after his camp was trounced in European elections last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His gamble backfired, with the far-right National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen winning the June 30 first round. But the key suspense now is whether the RN can get enough seats to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faced with the prospect of the far right taking power for the first time since France's occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II, Macron's camp and the left have urged a broad "Republican Front" to stop Le Pen's anti-immigration and eurosceptic party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Tuesday evening's deadline to register, more than 210 pro-Macron or left-wing candidates had pulled out of contests in an attempt to prevent the RN winning seats, in what appeared a welcome development for the presidential camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Le Pen appeared to row back on previous comments that the RN would only form a government with an absolute majority of 289 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, saying it would still try if slightly below this figure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said her party would seek to form a government and make her 28-year-old protege Jordan Bardella prime minister even with as little as "for example, 270 deputies", requiring them to find support from another 19 MPs to govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we then have a majority, then yes, of course, we'll go and do what the voters elected us to do," she told broadcaster France Inter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Bardella becomes prime minister, this would create a tense period of "cohabitation" with Macron, who has vowed to serve out his term until 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, 35, said late on Monday it "would be catastrophic for the French" to give the far right an absolute majority. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A House Democratic lawmaker has become the first in the party to publicly call for President Joe Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee for president, citing Biden’s debate performance failing to “effectively defend his many accomplishments.”
 <br>
  <br/>
  Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas said in a statement on Tuesday that Biden should “make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My decision to make these strong reservations public is not done lightly nor does it in any way diminish my respect for all that President Biden has achieved,” Doggett said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Recognising that, unlike Trump, President Biden’s first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. I respectfully call on him to do so.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 116 people were crushed to death at a Hindu religious gathering in northern India on Tuesday, with many others injured, a senior government official said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A large crowd had gathered near the city of Hathras for a sermon by a popular preacher but a fierce dust storm sparked panic as people were leaving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many were crushed or trampled, falling on top of each other, with some collapsing into a roadside drain in the chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attendees were exiting the venue when a dust storm blinded their vision, leading to a melee and the subsequent tragic incident," said Chaitra V, divisional commissioner of Aligarh city in Uttar Pradesh state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We... are focusing on providing relief and medical aid for the victims," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours after the tragedy, she told reporters the toll had surged past a hundred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Updated information.. is that 116 people have died," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of the dead were women, according to state chief medical officer Umesh Kumar Tripathi, who told reporters "many injured" have been hospitalised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lines of ambulances rushed the injured to hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wailing women and crying men gathered outside one mortuary in the town of Etah, where many of the dead were taken, seeking news of their relatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the sermon finished, everyone started running out," Shakuntala, a woman who gave only one name, told the Press Trust of India news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People fell in a drain by the road. They started falling one on top of the other and got crushed to death."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of US$2,400 to the next of kin of those who died and US$600 to those injured in the "tragic incident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My condolences are with those who have lost their loved ones... I wish for the speedy recovery of all the injured," Modi wrote on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Droupadi Murmu said the deaths were "heart-rending" and offered her "deepest condolences." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hurricane Beryl slammed into the Caribbean island of Carriacou on Monday, producing "life-threatening conditions" including disastrous winds, according to US trackers, after the storm strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the "extremely dangerous eyewall" moving over the island, which is part of Grenada, the US National Hurricane Centre warned residents "not to leave their shelter as winds will rapidly increase."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eye of Beryl made landfall on Carriacou Island at 1510 GMT, the NHC reported on X, adding in a bulletin that it was creating "catastrophic winds and life-threatening storm surge."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Posting a video showing large waves, the Office of the Prime Minister of Grenada wrote on Facebook that the tri-island state was "experiencing intense winds and damage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation," the NHC said. "Residents should not leave their shelter and remain in place through the passage of these life-threatening conditions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts say that such a powerful storm forming this early in the Atlantic hurricane season – which runs from early June to late November – is extremely rare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only five major (Category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July," hurricane expert Michael Lowry posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell urged citizens to quickly seek shelter and respect an island-wide curfew ordered for 7:00 pm to 7:00 am Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farther northeast in the Caribbean, officials in Barbados said the island was buffeted by high winds and pelting rain, but appeared to have avoided disaster, reporting no injuries so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barbados seems to have "dodged a bullet," Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a video, but nonetheless "gusts are still coming, the storm-force winds are still coming" he said, warning residents to remain inside until the all-clear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barbados, Grenada, plus Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago were all under hurricane warnings, the NHC said, while a hurricane watch or tropical storm warnings or watches were in effect for Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad, St Lucia, and parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A state of emergency was declared in Tobago, the smaller of the two islands that make up Trinidad and Tobago, with schools ordered closed on Monday, top official Farley Augustine said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A meeting this week in Grenada of the Caribbean regional bloc Caricom was postponed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beryl became the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season early on Saturday morning and quickly strengthened to Category 4, the first ever to reach that level in June, according to NHC records. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least nine people were killed and four others were injured when a car struck pedestrians near Seoul city hall on Monday, police said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were six fatalities at the scene, while three others were pronounced dead after being rushed to hospital, firefighter Kim Chun-soo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that a 68-year-old driver crashed into people who were waiting at a traffic signal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was driving in the wrong direction and hit two other vehicles before ploughing into the pedestrians, Yonhap said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man was detained by police over the incident, said Kim Suk-hwan, safety and transport director at the city's Jung-gu district office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigations are underway to determine if drugs or alcohol were involved, as well as whether the deadly incident was caused by accidental acceleration, Kim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon described "a very sad accident" as he visited the crash site, according to city authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also ordered officials to "take the victims to the hospital quickly and thoroughly identify the cause of the accident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deadly transport accidents with multiple casualties are rare in South Korea, which generally has well-maintained roads and vehicles. (AFP)

    Court sends Trump's immunity case back to lower court

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Anti-Trump demonstrators gather outside the US Supreme Court. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759850_1_20240701232444.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Supreme Court on Monday ruled for the first time that former presidents have some immunity from prosecution, extending the delay in the Washington criminal case against Donald Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ending prospects the former president could be tried before the November election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an historic 6-3 ruling, the justices returned Trump's case to the trial court to determine what is left of special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Trump. The outcome means additional delay before Trump could face trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court’s decision in a second major Trump case this term, along with its ruling rejecting efforts to bar him from the ballot because of his actions following the 2020 election, underscores the direct and possibly uncomfortable role the justices are playing in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. “And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roberts was joined by the other five conservative justices. The three liberal justices dissented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Today’s decision to grant former presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the presidency. It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a scathing dissent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sotomayor, who read a summary of her dissent aloud in the courtroom, said the protection afforded presidents by the court "is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump posted on his social media network shortly after the decision was released: “BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!” (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A controversial spiritual leader in Nepal known as “Buddha Boy” has been sentenced to a 10-year prison term on Monday for sexually assaulting a minor, court officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ram Bahadur Bamjan – believed by some to be the reincarnation of the founder of Buddhism – was also ordered to pay US$3,700 in compensation to the victim by a judge at the Sarlahi District Court in southern Nepal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man will have 70 days to appeal against the court order, court official Sadan Adhikari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police arrested Bomjan from a suburb in Nepal's capital Kathmandu in January on charges of sexual assault and suspicion of involvement in the disappearance of at least four of his followers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepalese banknotes worth US$227,000 and other foreign currencies amounting to US$23,000 were seized from him at the time of the arrest, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the court found him guilty of sexually assaulting an underage girl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The charges related to the disappearances of his followers are still pending trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bamjan is believed by many Nepalese to be the reincarnation of Siddhartha Gautama, who was born in southwestern Nepal some 2,600 years ago and became revered as the Buddha. Buddhist scholars have been sceptical of Bamjan’s claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bamjan became famous in southern Nepal in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His popularity has declined amid accusations of sexual and physical assaults on his followers, but he still maintains camps in southern Nepal where thousands come to worship or live. (AP)

    Macron and allies hope to block RN in second round

    <![CDATA[<img alt="French President Emmanuel Macron casts his vote in the first round. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759825_1_20240701173746.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron and his allies were on Monday beginning a week of intense campaigning ahead of the second round of legislative elections to prevent the far right from taking an absolute majority and control of government in a historic first.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The far-right National Rally (RN) party of Marine Le Pen won a resounding victory in the first round of the polls on Sunday, with Macron's centrists trailing in third behind a left-wing coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the key suspense ahead of the second round on July 7 was whether the RN would win an absolute majority in the new National Assembly, enabling it to form a government and make Le Pen's protege Jordan Bardella, 28, prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most projections published by French polling organisations showed the RN falling short of an absolute majority, but the final outcome remains far from certain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hung parliament could lead to months of political paralysis and chaos -- just as Paris is preparing to host the Olympic Games this summer, and while France on the international stage takes a prime role in backing Ukraine against the Russian invasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who is likely to be forced to resign after the second round, warned that the far right was now at the "gates of power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RN should not get a "single vote" in the second round, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seven days to spare France from catastrophe," said Raphael Glucksmann, a key figure in the left-wing alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RN garnered 33 percent of the vote, compared to 28 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and more than 20 percent for Macron's centrist camp, according to preliminary results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with less than 100 seats being decided outright in the first round, the final composition of the 577-seat National Assembly will only be clear after the second phase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second round will see a three-way or two-way run-off in the remainder of the seats to be decided, with Macron's camp hoping that tactical voting will prevent the RN winning the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French stock market, which had been under considerable pressure in June amid the political uncertainty, also rallied in early trading on hopes the RN would not win an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron in a written statement urged a "broad" coalition against the far-right in the second round, amid controversy among supporters over whether they should tactically vote for the left where needed in the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late Sunday police said some 8,000 left-wing supporters thronged the Place de la Republique in central Paris to denounce the prospect of the far right taking power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Risk analysis firm Eurasia Group said the RN now looked "likely" to fall short of an absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France was facing "at least 12 months with a rancorously blocked National Assembly and -- at best -- a technocratic government of 'national unity' with limited capacity to govern", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The left-leaning newspaper Liberation in an editorial called on Macron to remove all his alliance's candidates from districts when they had arrived in third place to give the left-wing alliance a chance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The head of state has thrown France under the bus. The bus has continued its course unimpeded, and is now parked in front of the gates of Matignon", the prime minister's office, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrival of the anti-immigration and eurosceptic RN in government would be a turning point in French modern history: the first time a far-right force has taken power in the country since World War II, when it was occupied by Nazi Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella said he wanted to be the "prime minister of all French".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would create a tense period of "cohabitation" with Macron, who has vowed to serve out his term until 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella has said he will only form a government if the RN wins an absolute majority in the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rancour remained over Macron's decision to call the election in the first place, a move he took with only a tight circle of advisers in the hours after his party was trounced by the RN in European elections this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chaos risks damaging the international credibility of Macron, regarded by some as the European Union's number-one leader and who immediately after the second round will attend the Nato summit in Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The right-wing Le Figaro in its editorial lamented a "disaster" brought about by the "unfathomable lightness of a man, through narcissist rancour, took the risk of plunging his country into chaos". (AFP)

    North Korea launches two ballistic missiles

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Last week, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a multiple warhead missile, also this was disputed by the South. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759742_1_20240701085745.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea on Monday launched two ballistic missiles, South Korea's military confirmed -- the latest in a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang that have soured relations with Seoul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A short-range ballistic missile was launched in the early morning hours, the South's military Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. About 10 minutes later, a second missile, this one as yet unidentified, was detected, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our military has strengthened surveillance and vigilance in preparation for further launches," the JCS said, adding it had shared information about the incidents with the United States and Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not offer immediate confirmation of the launches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a multiple warhead missile, but the South said that launch ended in a mid-air explosion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing while bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang says those missives are in retaliation for balloons loaded with anti-regime propaganda leaflets sent northwards by activists in the South.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the North's repeated launches, South Korea has fully suspended a tension-reducing military treaty. It also resumed propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts and live-fire drills near the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea also has grown anxious over the North's warming relations with its isolated neighbour Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea is accused of breaching arms control measures by supplying weapons to Russia to use in its war in Ukraine, and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in June in a show of unity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Pyongyang condemned joint military drills by South Korea, Japan and the United States, calling them an "Asian version of Nato" and warning of "fatal consequences".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-day "Freedom Edge" exercises included preparation in ballistic missile and air defences, anti-submarine warfare and defensive cyber training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang has always decried similar combined exercises as rehearsals for an invasion, but Seoul said Sunday the latest exercises were a continuation of defensive drills held regularly for years. (AFP)

    French far right wins election first round: estimates

Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759720_1_20240701022400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's far right won the first round of pivotal legislative elections on Sunday with the centrist forces of President Emmanuel Macron coming in only third behind the left after the highest turnout in over four decades, estimates said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it remained unclear if the far-right National Rally (RN) party of Marine Le Penn would win an absolute majority of seats in the new National Assembly lower house in the July 7 second round and allow her to claim claim the post of prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron had stunned the nation and baffled even some allies by calling snap polls after the RN trounced his centrist forces in European Parliament elections this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That gamble risks backfiring, with Macron's alliance now expected to win a far smaller minority contingent in parliament, making the president a far less powerful figure for the remaining three years of his term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Projections from prominent French polling firms gave the RN 34.5 percent of the vote, compared to 28.5-29.1 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and 20.5-21.5 percent for Macron's centrist camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The polling agencies projected this would give the RN a majority of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly after the second round and a possible absolute majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Macron called for a "broad" alliance against the far right in the second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the French facing their most polarising choices in recent history, turnout soared. The Elabe organisation projecting a final turnout of 67.5 percent, the highest participation in a regular format legislative election in France since 1981.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final turnout in 2022 was just 47.5 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two large wildfires were burning on Sunday near Greece's capital of Athens, and authorities sent emergency messages for some residents to evacuate and others to stay at home and close their windows to protect themselves from smoke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first blaze, southeast of Athens, began in the early afternoon. Local authorities said it burned at least four homes and several cars. No casualties were reported by 6 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blaze was approaching the port of Lavrio about 60 kilometers southeast of Athens. The area has suffered from wildfires in recent years. A small forest to the south, near Cape Sounio, also could be in danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second, fast-moving fire later began north of Athens near the suburb of Stamata. It was burning through scrubland and forest and moving up 1,100-metre Mount Penteli, one of four mountains ringing the capital area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 230 firefighters, 17 planes and 12 helicopters were trying to put out both fires, the Fire Service said. The planes and helicopters can only operate in daylight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hot and dry weather, combined with strong winds, are helping spread the fires. Temperatures in the low 30s Celsius are expected to rise on Monday and Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires have become an annual feature in the Mediterranean. Earlier this month, Greece and Turkey saw large fires. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of people marched in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Sunday, in tribute to those who died in anti-government demonstrations this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to NGOs, at least 30 people died in protests driven by a government drive to substantially raise taxes in the East African country – although the government has not given any official toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largely peaceful rallies turned violent last Tuesday when lawmakers passed the deeply unpopular tax increases following pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police opened fire on protesters who stormed the parliament complex and a fire broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clashes were unprecedented in the history of the country since its independence from Britain in 1963.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, a few hundred people gathered in Uhuru Park in central Nairobi following an appeal on central media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After singing and lighting candles, they waved Kenyan flags and chanted as they marched past the hospital where some of the injured protesters are being treated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators dispersed peacefully late in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the protests turned deadly on June 25, President William Ruto's administration ultimately withdrew the bill. (AFP)

    Seven dead after storms lash France, Switzerland

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ferocious storms and torrential rains that lashed France, Switzerland and Italy this weekend have left seven people dead, local authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three people in their 70s and 80s died in France's northeastern Aube region on Saturday when a tree crushed the car they were travelling in during fierce winds, the local authority said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth passenger was in critical care, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Switzerland, four people have died and another is missing, according to local police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three were killed after torrential rains triggered a landslide in the southeast, police in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man was also found dead in a hotel in Saas-Grun in the southwest canton of Valais, police said, adding that he was probably taken by surprise by a sudden rapid rise in floodwater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another man is also missing in Valais, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The civil security services said "several hundred" people were evacuated in Valais and roads closed after the Rhone and its tributaries overflowed in different locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency services were assessing the best way to evacuate 300 people who had arrived for a football tournament in Peccia, while almost 70 more were being evacuated from a holiday camp in the village of Mogno.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The poor weather was making rescue work particularly difficult, police had said earlier, with several valleys inaccessible and cut off from the electricity network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The federal alert system also said part of the canton was without drinking water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extreme rainfall also struck southeastern Switzerland last weekend, leaving one dead and causing major damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In northern Italy's Aosta Valley, internet users shared images of spectacular floods and swollen rivers rushing down mountain slopes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Five people, including a four-year-old child, were killed in a massive explosion at a pyrotechnics warehouse in the southern Philippines, emergency services said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Saturday afternoon blast at the Zamboanga City site tore a large hole in the ground, sent debris careening into nearby buildings and houses and ignited a blaze, fire investigator Luigi Chan told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four warehouse workers and the four-year-old son of one of the staffers were killed, Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city disaster office confirmed the death toll and said another 38 people had been injured in the incident, eight of them seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said they are investigating the cause of the explosion, which created a 20-metre (66-foot) crater, dismantled the depot's walls and rained rubble on a nearby soft drinks factory, a grains and flour warehouse and area homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most probable origin of the fire is the pyrotechnics stored at the warehouse," Chan told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the blast radius extended more than 3,000 square metres (0.8 acres) and it took firefighters more than two hours to bring the blaze under control. (AFP)

    France heads to the polls in snap election

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A person casts a vote in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759641_1_20240630100209.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French people vote on Sunday in high-stakes snap parliamentary elections which could alter France's trajectory and see the far-right party of Marine Le Pen take power in a historic first.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With Russia's war against Ukraine in its third year and energy and food prices much higher, support for the anti-immigration and eurosceptic National Rally (RN) party has surged despite President Emmanuel Macron's pledges to prevent its ascent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polling stations open across mainland France for the first round of elections at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) and close 12 hours later, immediately followed by projections that usually predict the result with a degree of accuracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voters in France's overseas territories that span the globe cast ballots earlier in the weekend. Some 49 million French are eligible to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round, a week later, on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls show that National Rally is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the RN obtains an absolute majority, RN party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense "cohabitation" with Macron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse," Rahman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, thousands of people joined an LGBT Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms," said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has deplored "racism or anti-Semitism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Support for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off. The party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!" Le Pen wrote on social media platform X on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Macron, France has been one of Ukraine's main Western backers since Russia invaded in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Le Pen and Bardella have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a "civil war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins. (AFP)

    Policeman wounded near Israeli embassy in Belgrade

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Serbian police officer on Saturday killed a man who shot him in the neck with a crossbow in front of the Israeli embassy in Belgrade, in what the prime minister called a "terrorist act".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police identified the assailant as being a "convert" to Islam, who was born in 1999 in the town of Mladenovac, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack happened around 11:00 am (1700 HKT) on Saturday in the Serbian capital, when the attacker shot the officer who was on duty outside the Israeli embassy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The policeman "used a weapon in self-defence and defeated the attacker, who died as a result of his injuries", said Interior Minister Ivica Dacic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said some arrests had been made and a number of people known to the security services were suspected of being linked to the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also said they were carring out searches in a number of locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer, who underwent surgery in hospital, was in his guard booth when the attack happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to authorities, the assailant had moved to live in Novi Pazar, which is a historical and political centre of the Bosniak Muslim minority in Serbia, and a centre of Islam in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dacic told reporters that there were early indications connecting the attack with people suspected of being linked to the Wahhabi movement -- an ultra-conservative branch of Islam that dominates in Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said several people had been arrested for "prevention reasons" and that overall security had been stepped up in Belgrade. Special prosecutors had taken over the case, added Dacic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic strongly condemned what he labelled a "heinous terrorist act".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was an act of insanity, which cannot be attributed to any religion and any nation. It is a crime of an individual," he said, according to quotes from the Beta news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister said his country would firmly respond to the threat of terrorism and stressed Serbian citizens could "feel safe".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli foreign ministry called it an "attempted terrorist attack in the vicinity" of the country's embassy in Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The embassy is closed and no employee of the embassy was injured", it said in a statement, saying the circumstances are still being investigated. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This screen shot from a handout video of BOLIVIA TV, shows Bolivia's dismissed army commander Juan Jose Zuniga being arrested. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759556_1_20240629103544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three suspected leaders of a failed coup against Bolivian President Luis Arce were remanded in custody on Friday for six months, the country's top prosecutor said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former army chief Juan Jose Zuniga, former head of navy Juan Arnez and Alejandro Irahola, former head of the army's mechanized brigade, will be held in a high-security prison not far from the capital La Paz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This pre-trial detention ordered by the judge will undoubtedly set a precedent, and is a good signal for the investigation to move forward," said Attorney General Cesar Siles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three officers face charges of engaging in an armed uprising and terrorism and face up to 20 years in prison, Siles said on state television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 21 active, retired and civilian military personnel were arrested in connection with Wednesday's attempted coup, in which troops and tanks were deployed in the heart of the capital, where they tried to break down a door of the presidential palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuniga said his goal was to "restructure democracy" in Bolivia. He was soon captured and the troops pulled back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an unusual twist, Zuniga claimed he was following Arce's orders and that the president had hoped for the coup to trigger a crackdown that would boost his popularity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arce denied the allegations. "How could one order or plan a coup on one's self?" he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions in the Andean nation have been rising in recent weeks over surging prices, shortages of dollars and fuel, and a feud between Arce and powerful former president Evo Morales ahead of the 2025 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced Thursday that he would soon visit his "friend" Arce to support him following the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia "strongly" condemned the attempted military coup, its foreign ministry said Thursday, warning against "destructive foreign interference" in the South American country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres "welcomes the peaceful resolution of the situation," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, having earlier expressed alarm over the abortive coup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Condemnations of the coup bid also poured in from Madrid, Washington and across Latin America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolivia, which has a long history of military coups, has in recent weeks been rocked by an economic crisis due to a drop in natural gas production, its main source of foreign currency until 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country has had to reduce fuel imports, and there is a shortage of dollars, which has triggered protests by powerful unions of merchants and freight transporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government at Cornell University in New York state, told AFP the failed coup was "a symptom of a significant and broad discontent" in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For now, "we must carefully evaluate how widespread the discontent is within the armed forces," he said, adding that Arce's government was facing "a critical moment of weakness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bolivia is also deeply polarized after years of political instability, and the ruling Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) party is riven by internal conflict between supporters of Arce and his former mentor Morales. (AFP)

 America's most influential newspaper, The New York Times, called in an editorial on Friday for President Joe Biden to step aside and allow another Democrat to challenge Donald Trump for the White House in November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Describing Biden as "the shadow of a great public servant," the newspaper's editorial board - which is separate from its newsroom - said Thursday's debate between the president and Trump proved the 81-year-old "failed his own test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His determination to run again is a "reckless gamble," it said, adding: "the greatest public service Mr Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election." (AFP)

    River Seine fails water quality tests before Olympics

<div class="itemFullText">
 The river Seine is still failing water quality tests one month before the Paris Olympics when it is scheduled to host the open-water swimming competition and the swimming leg of the triathlon, results showed Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The latest tests, completed last week and released by the Paris mayor's office, showed levels of the E.Coli bacteria – an indicator of faecal matter – are far above the upper limits imposed by sports federations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water quality remains degraded because of unfavourable hydrological conditions, little sunshine, below-average seasonal temperatures and upstream pollution," the mayor's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities have spent 1.4 billion euros (US$1.5 billion) in the last decade trying to clean up the river by improving the Paris sewerage system, as well as building new water treatment and storage facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But major storms still overwhelm the capital's waste water network, some of which dates back to the 19th century, leading to discharges of untreated sewage directly into the river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers insist that some dry weather and sunshine in July should be sufficient to make the Seine fit for the outdoor swimming events. (AFP)

    UAE cuts Friday sermons at mosques over sizzling heat

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Arab Emirates has shortened Friday sermons at mosques to protect worshippers from severe heat, amid rising summer temperatures linked to climate change.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The General Authority of Islamic Affairs ordered preachers to limit Friday sermons to 10 minutes from June to October, when temperatures cool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sermons usually last for 20 minutes for the main weekly prayers on Fridays but can run even longer, with large crowds gathering outside mosques at midday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was aimed at ensuring "the safety of worshippers... especially during the summer months", the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It coincides with UAE authorities' efforts to avoid heat strokes and other complications as temperatures approach 50 degrees Celsius in parts of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From June until September, the UAE prohibits work under direct sunlight and in open-air areas between noon and 3pm as part of a longstanding "midday break" policy widely adopted across the Gulf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The desert region, already one of the world's hottest, faces rising threats from high temperatures attributed to climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, more than 1,300 people died while performing the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia during intense heat, according to Saudi authorities. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 French authorities said gatherings in the Pacific territory of New Caledonia would be banned this weekend and a curfew extended, weeks after deadly riots and as the country prepares for high-stakes snap polls starting Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France is on tenterhooks ahead of a two-round vote which could see the anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic far right take the largest number of seats in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first round takes place on Sunday, followed by a second round on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The High Commission, which represents the French state in the archipelago, announced a ban on gatherings from Saturday morning until Sunday evening in New Caledonia, which was hit by the deadly unrest last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mid-May, rioting and looting erupted in New Caledonia over an electoral reform plan that Indigenous Kanak people feared would leave them in a permanent minority, putting independence hopes definitively out of reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The High Commission also said that the 8.00pm to 6.00am curfew in place since the start of the riots had been extended until July 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High Commissioner Louis Le Franc noted that the situation "had improved", but pointed out that public infrastructure had recently sustained "very serious damage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 1,500 people have been arrested since the unrest began in New Caledonia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence has left nine dead and damage estimated at more than 1.5 billion euros (US$1.6 billion). (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Flights are disrupted after a portion of the canopy at the departure area of Terminal 1 collapses. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759474_1_20240628173546.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavy rainfall and winds brought down a roof at the main airport in New Delhi on Friday, killing one person and disrupting flights from a domestic terminal, while flooded streets and traffic snarls threw daily life out of gear in India's capital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airport area received about 148.5mm of rain over three hours in the early morning, more than the average for all of June, according to India's weather office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city of 20 million people received 228.1mm rainfall at its main Safdarjung weather station in the 24 hours ending 8.30am local time on Friday, a 266 percent departure from normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A portion of the canopy at the departure area of Terminal 1 collapsed and flight operations were shut down until 2pm, India's aviation minister told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The entire terminal, one of three at the country's biggest and busiest airport, was evacuated and an inquiry ordered into the collapse, said the minister, Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue work had been completed and eight injured people were taken to hospital, said Atul Garg, the director of Delhi Fire Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 flights were cancelled and 40 were delayed while departures from Delhi airport were running late by an average of 50 minutes, according to data from flight tracking platform Flightradar24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arrivals and departures of flights scheduled from Terminal 1 after 2pm were diverted through the other two terminuses, Naidu said, adding that passengers will receive full refunds or have the option of booking on alternate flights and routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visuals from Indian TV channels showed a taxi crushed under a wrecked metal pillar at the entrance area of the terminal, which is mostly used by low-cost carriers IndiGo, operated by Interglobe Aviation, and SpiceJet for domestic flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 10-12 cars were damaged and vehicles were still being pulled out from under the debris, said one of the workers at the airport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I first missed my flight in the morning due to floods. Then my 2.10pm Indigo flight to Bangalore has been cancelled. I have to urgently reach Bangalore for an official meeting," said Asif Ali, a businessman standing outside Terminal 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many other parts of Delhi were flooded as well and cars trapped in thigh-deep water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Metro services were affected, traffic snarls were reported from several parts of the city while several residents also complained of power cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the April-May general election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated or laid the foundation stone of new terminal buildings at 15 airports at a cost of 98 billion rupees (US$1.17 billion).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Delhi's Terminal 1 and the terminal at Jabalpur were part of the projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposition parties criticised Modi's government, saying projects were inaugurated in a hurry before the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption and criminal negligence is responsible for the collapse of shoddy infrastructure falling like a deck of cards, in the past 10 years of Modi Govt," Mallikarjun Kharge, the president of the main opposition Congress party, said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aviation Minister Naidu defended the government, saying the roof collapse at Delhi's airport was part of an old building that was opened in 2009 and not the one Modi inaugurated in March. (Reuters)

    Biden, Trump exchange barbs in fierce debate

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Biden stumbled over his words on several occasions while Trump made false allegations against his rival. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759440_1_20240628133105.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden delivered an uneven performance while his Republican rival Donald Trump battered him with a series of often false attacks at their debate on Thursday, as the two oldest presidential candidates ever exchanged personal insults ahead of the November election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two men traded barbs on abortion, immigration, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, their handling of the economy and even their golf games as they each sought to shake up what opinion polls show has been a virtually tied race for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A hoarse-sounding Biden stumbled over his words on several occasions during the debate's first half-hour. But he found his footing at the halfway mark when he attacked Trump over his conviction for covering up hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, calling him a "felon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Trump brought up the recent conviction of Biden's son, Hunter, for lying about his drug use to buy a gun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments later, Biden noted that almost all of Trump's former cabinet members, including former Vice President Mike Pence, have not endorsed his campaign. "They know him well, they served with him," he said. "Why are they not endorsing him?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, meanwhile, unleashed a barrage of criticisms, many of which were well-worn falsehoods he has long repeated, including claims that migrants have carried out a crime wave, that Democrats support infanticide and that he actually won the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden's delivery from the beginning of the debate drew the most attention afterward. Trump's allies immediately declared victory while prominent Democrats publicly questioned whether Biden could move forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the panic had set in,” said David Axelrod, a longtime advisor to former President Barack Obama on CNN, immediately after the debate about Biden's performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And I think you’re going to hear discussions that, I don’t know will lead to anything, but there are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Van Jones, another Democratic strategist, said on CNN: “He did not do well at all.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One top Biden donor, who did not want to be identified while criticising the president, called his performance "disqualifying" and said he expected a fresh round of calls for him to step aside ahead of the party's national convention in August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice President Kamala Harris, appearing on CNN after the debate, acknowledged what she called Biden's "slow start" but argued that voters should judge him and Trump based on their years in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about his performance in the debate, Biden told reporters afterwards that “I think we did well,” but said he has a sore throat. Pressed about Democratic concerns with his showing that he should consider stepping aside, Biden said, "No, it's hard to debate a liar.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, were both under pressure to display their fitness for office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been dogged by questions about his age and sharpness, while Trump's incendiary rhetoric and sprawling legal woes remain a vulnerability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many television viewers took to social media to complain, describing the debate as a "disaster," a "train wreck," and a "waste of time," expressing concerns about America's future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple polls show that the majority of American voters are weary of another Biden-Trump matchup in the 2024 presidential election, with the proportion of voters holding negative views of both candidates reaching the highest level in 30 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second presidential debate for the 2024 U.S. election, to be hosted by ABC, is scheduled to take place on September 10. (Agencies)

    US Supreme Court allows emergency abortion in Idaho

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An anti-abortion protester demonstrates outside the US Supreme Court on the day when decisions are expected to be handed down. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759361_1_20240628041508.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court ruled on Thursday to permit, for now, abortions to be performed in Idaho when pregnant women are facing medical emergencies, as the justices dispensed with the contentious issue without actually deciding the case on its merits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 6-3 ruling, with three of the six conservative justices dissenting, effectively reinstated a lower court's decision that Idaho's Republican-backed near-total abortion ban must yield to a 1986 US law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) when the two statutes conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A version of the ruling was inadvertently posted to the court's website on Wednesday in the second instance in the past two years of the disclosure of a major abortion decision before its formal issuance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden's administration had sued Idaho, arguing that EMTALA takes precedence over state law. EMTALA ensures that patients can receive emergency care at hospitals that receive funding under the federal Medicare programme. Idaho is among six states with abortion bans that offer no exceptions to protect the health of pregnant women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court's decision, an unsigned, one-line order, lifted a block, or stay, that the justices had placed on the lower court's ruling in January. But the Supreme Court did not resolve the underlying legal dispute, opting instead to dismiss the case as "improvidently granted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a separate opinion agreed with the court's decision to lift its stay, but said she would not have dismissed the case, calling the legal situation a "fragile detente".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to this tragic situation, and we have squandered it," Jackson wrote. "And for as long as we refuse to declare what the law requires, pregnant patients in Idaho, Texas and elsewhere will be paying the price."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May 2022, a draft of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling rolling back abortion rights was leaked to the news media a month before the decision was formally issued. The Supreme Court carried out an investigation but failed to identify the leaker. The ruling overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent that had recognised a constitutional right to abortion and legalised the procedure nationwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the 2022 abortion ruling, a series of states, including Idaho, enacted Republican-backed laws imposing bans on abortion. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A defunct Russian satellite has broken up into more than 100 pieces of debris in orbit, forcing astronauts on the International Space Station to take shelter for about an hour and adding to the mass of space junk already in orbit, US space agencies said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were no immediate details on what caused the break-up of the Resurs-P1 Russian Earth observation satellite, which was declared dead in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Space Command, tracking the debris swarm, said there was no immediate threat to other satellites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event took place on Wednesday afternoon, Space Command said. It occurred in an orbit near the space station, prompting US astronauts on board to shelter in their spacecraft for roughly an hour, Nasa's Space Station office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's space agency Roscosmos, which operated the satellite, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Space Command, which has its own global network of space-tracking radars, said the satellite immediately created "over 100 pieces of trackable debris".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Large debris-generating events in orbit are rare but of increasing concern as space becomes crowded with satellite networks vital to everyday life on Earth, from broadband internet and communications to basic navigation services, as well as satellites no longer in use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia sparked strong criticism from the US and other Western countries in 2021 when it struck one of its defunct satellites in orbit with a ground-based anti-satellite (Asat) missile launched from its Plesetsk rocket site. The blast, testing a weapon system ahead of Moscow's 2022 war with Ukraine, created thousands of pieces of orbital debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the roughly 88-minute window of Resurs-P1's initial break-up, the Plesetsk site was one of many locations on Earth it passed over, but there was no immediate indication from airspace or maritime alerts that Russia had launched a missile to strike the satellite, space-tracker and Harvard astronomer Jonathan McDowell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I find it hard to believe they would use such a big satellite as an Asat target," McDowell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He and other analysts speculated the break-up could have been caused by a problem with the satellite, such as leftover fuel onboard causing an explosion. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain said on Thursday it will send 313 police officers to Paris to bolster security for this summer's Olympic Games as France remains on high alert following attack threats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The officers, including bomb deactivation experts and sniffer dog teams, will be deployed in response to a request from France for foreign assistance with Games security, the Spanish interior ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France, which will host the games from July 26 to August 11, has raised its security alert to the highest level after the deadly attack at a Moscow concert hall in March. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the massacre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spanish police will stay in Paris for the Paralympics which will be held from August 28 to September 8, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French capital has been repeatedly hit by deadly attacks by Islamic extremists and security concerns are notably high for the opening ceremony of the Games, which will involve boats along the Seine River and huge crowds watching from the embankments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 45,000 police officers and gendarmes will be mobilised in the Paris region for the event. During the games themselves, 18,000 French military troops will be deployed, including 3,000 responsible for aerial surveillance – in addition to about 35,000 police and gendarmes. (AFP)

    'Record' number sleeping on streets of London

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some 11,993 people were seen rough-sleeping in London in the year to March – up 58 percent in a decade and the highest number recorded in a single year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of people sleeping on the streets of London has hit a record high of nearly 12,000, latest figures showed on Thursday, as the impact of the UK's cost-of-living crisis bites.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Britain, the world's sixth-biggest economy, saw decades-high inflation in 2023 and a shortage of affordable rental properties over recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 11,993 people were seen rough-sleeping in the capital in the year to March – up 58 percent in a decade and the highest number recorded in a single year, according to Homeless Link, the body for groups dealing with homelessness in England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2013-14, the number of people sleeping on the streets stood at 7,581.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Homeless Link chief executive Rick Henderson called the figures "appalling" and said the government that comes out of a July 4 general election should form a cross-party plan to tackle the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "genuinely affordable and secure homes" need to be delivered quickly with properly-funded services to "help people address the root causes of their destitution and move on from rough sleeping for good".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK nationals made up 45 percent of those sleeping rough, according to Homeless Link figures. Of the rest, nearly a third came from countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australasia, while about a quarter were from Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Homelessness charity Crisis said the overall figures were "deeply shameful and highlight the desperate need for the next government to get a grip on this crisis".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charities and campaigners have long called for a government commitment to build 90,000 social rent homes a year. (AFP)

    US says Assange, now free, had put people in 'danger'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Julian Assange gives a huge thumbs up after arriving at Canberra Airport. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759193_1_20240627022726.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US State Department on Wednesday renewed its allegation that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange put people at risk for revealing secrets, after he was freed in a plea deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The documents they published gave identifying information of individuals who were in contact with the State Department – that included opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world – whose positions were put in some danger because of their public disclosure," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also chilled the ability of American personnel to build relationships and have frank conversations," Miller said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website from 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian agreed to plea guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information and was sentenced to the time he had served in London – five years and two months – and given his liberty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange has become a hero for activists who point to his role in divulging information about the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but critics fault him for putting out vast quantities of government documents without any filtering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miller said that the State Department at the time "had to scramble to get people out of danger, to move them out of harm's way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pressed on whether anyone was harmed in the end, Miller said, "If you drive drunk down the street and get pulled over for drunk driving, the fact that you didn't crash into another car and kill someone doesn't get you out of the reckless actions and the endangerment that you put your fellow citizens in."

    Nato names Dutch PM Rutte as next boss

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mark Rutte finally clinched the job last week when his sole challenger, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, dropped out. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759184_1_20240626233925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato's 32 nations on Wednesday appointed outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the alliance's next chief, handing him the job at a crucial moment with Russia on the march in Ukraine and US elections looming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rutte will take over from Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on October 1 after major powers – spearheaded by the United States – agreed on his nomination ahead of a summit of Nato leaders in Washington next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mark is a true transatlanticist, a strong leader and a consensus-builder," Stoltenberg said on social media after Nato ambassadors approved the appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know I am leaving Nato in good hands," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte said it was a "tremendous honour" to take over from Stoltenberg once his decade at the helm of Nato ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The alliance is and will remain the cornerstone of our collective security. Leading this organisation is a responsibility I do not take lightly," he posted online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seasoned Dutch leader, whose 14-year tenure leading the Netherlands is set to end within weeks, is seen as a safe pair of hands capable of stewarding Nato through perilous times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment was welcomed by leaders across the 75-year-old alliance, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who called it "a good choice for freedom and security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said US President Joe Biden believed Rutte "will make an excellent secretary general."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the 57-year-old faces the possibility of a possible return by former US president Donald Trump to the White House, who has long criticised the alliance, Rutte will also have to grapple with the threat posed by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After staking a claim for the Nato post following the collapse of his Dutch coalition government last year, Rutte had to use all his diplomatic skills to win over reluctant allies Turkey and Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finally clinched the race last week when his sole challenger, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, dropped out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A staunch supporter of Ukraine, the straight-talking Dutchman has spearheaded a push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets to help beat back Russia's assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Nato chief he will play a key role in marshalling allies to keep backing the war-torn country – while treading a fine line over Kyiv's push to join the alliance. (AFP)

    Kenya's Ruto says finance bill to be withdrawn

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tuesday's protests led to the deaths of more than 20 people. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759183_1_20240626233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenyan President William Ruto said on Wednesday that a bill containing contentious tax hikes would "be withdrawn," dramatically reversing course after more than 20 people died and parliament was ransacked by protesters opposed to the legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But he warned that the withdrawal of the finance bill would mean a significant shortfall in funding for development programmes designed to help farmers and schoolteachers, among others, as the East African nation struggles to lower its foreign debt burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I concede and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill and it shall subsequently be withdrawn," Ruto told a press briefing, adding: "The people have spoken."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto's administration has been taken by surprise by the intensity of opposition to its tax hikes, with protests breaking out across the country last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largely peaceful rallies turned violent on Tuesday when lawmakers passed the legislation and police fired live rounds into crowds that ransacked the partly ablaze parliament complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it had recorded 22 deaths and 300 injured victims, adding that they would launch an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Frustration over the rising cost of living spiralled last week as lawmakers began debating the bill containing the tax hikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto's cash-strapped government said the increases were needed to service the country's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings (US$78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of Kenya's GDP. (AFP)

    N Korea trash balloons disrupt Incheon Airport

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Takeoff and landing at South Korea's Incheon international airport was disrupted on Wednesday for about three hours before dawn because of balloons launched by North Korea filled with refuse, an airport spokesperson said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One balloon landed on the tarmac near passenger Terminal 2 and the three runways at Incheon were temporarily shut down, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has flown balloons carrying trash into South Korea since late May, with hundreds landing in South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several balloons were spotted in and around the airport boundaries, the spokesperson said, adding that this was not the first time operations at the airport – which is about 40km from the North Korean border – had been disrupted by balloons nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disruption to domestic and international flights occurred between 1.46am and 4.44am, and the runways have re-opened since then, Incheon International Airport Corporation said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has said the balloons are retaliation for a propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and activists in the South who regularly send over balloons carrying food, medicine, money and leaflets criticising the North's leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the items carried by the North Korean balloons have been articles printed with Hello Kitty characters, badly worn clothing, and soil containing traces of human faeces and parasites, South Korea has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, North Korea test-fired what appeared to be a hypersonic missile off its east coast on Wednesday, but it exploded in midair, South Korea's military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The missile was launched from near the capital, Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Japan's Defence Ministry said the missile flew to an altitude of about 100km and range of more than 200km. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange left a US court in Saipan where he was freed in a landmark plea deal on Wednesday, but did not address reporters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 52-year-old was seen leaving the court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a Pacific US territory, by car. He will now fly to Canberra in his native Australia, WikiLeaks said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His lawyer Jen Robinson hailed Wednesday as a "historic day" after Assange was freed by the US court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a historic day. It brings to an end 14 years of legal battles," she told reporters outside the court in Saipan. "It also brings to an end a case which has been recognised as the greatest threat to the First Amendment in the 21st century."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WikiLeaks founder has long been wanted by Washington for revealing military secrets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the three-hour hearing, Assange pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents but said he had believed the US Constitution's First Amendment, which protects free speech, shielded his activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working as a journalist I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information," he told the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believed the First Amendment protected that activity but I accept that it was ... a violation of the espionage statute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief US District Judge Ramona V Manglona accepted his guilty plea and released him due to time already served in a British jail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With this pronouncement, it appears that you will be able to walk out of this courtroom a free man," she said. (AFP/Reuters)
