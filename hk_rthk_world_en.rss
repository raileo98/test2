<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday it was "not too late" for Ukraine to win the war, agreeing with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Kyiv needs more weapons, while Russian forces advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg was in Ukraine when Russia claimed the capture of two eastern villages in 24 hours, rushing an advance in the Donetsk region before crucial US weapons reach Kyiv's exhausted forces on the front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ukraine has been outgunned for months, forced to ration its ammunition... But it's not too late for Ukraine to prevail," the Nato secretary general said at a press conference with Zelensky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said months-long delays in US military aid to Ukraine had "serious consequences on the battlefield."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said that "more support is on the way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our allies are looking into what more they can do and I expect new announcements soon. So we are working hard to meet Ukraine's urgent needs," he promised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has been dependent on Western military aid to counter Russia's larger and more powerful army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky urged faster deliveries to bolster the front line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Russian army is now trying to take advantage of the situation when we are expecting supplies from our partner," the Ukrainian leader said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is why promptness in supply literally means stabilisation of the front line," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together we must disrupt the Russian offensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking of the long-awaited aid, Zelensky said "some things have started to arrive" but declined to "go into details."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden gave final approval for the aid – blocked in Congress for months – last week, saying shipments will start "right away."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Ukraine said the situation was deteriorating for its troops in the eastern Donetsk region. (AFP)

    Dozens killed as dam bursts in flood-hit Kenya

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The resulting deluge uprooted trees, washed away several homes and sent vehicles flying. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751105_1_L_20240430014308.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 46 people including children died when a makeshift dam burst its banks in Kenya's Rift Valley in the early hours of Monday, a local official said, as torrential rains and floods battered the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people have been killed over the March-May wet season in Kenya as heavier than usual rainfall pounds East Africa, compounded by the El Nino weather pattern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents said the accident occurred in the dead of night when the dam burst near the town of Mai Mahiu in Nakuru county, sending torrents of water and mud gushing down a hill and engulfing everything in its path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deluge cut off a road, uprooted trees, washed away homes and sent vehicles flying, devastating the village of Kamuchiri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We heard what sounded like an earthquake and roars like a moving train," said Margaret Wangechi, a 52-year-old teacher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, said on Monday evening that there were 46 bodies at the mortuary, but warned that the number could increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dead included 20 women and 17 children, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nakuru governor Susan Kihika said 110 people were being treated in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers dug through the debris, using hoes and in some cases just their bare hands in a desperate search for survivors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We collected some of the bodies held by trees and we don't know how many are under the mud," Stephen Njihia Njoroge, a local resident involved in the emergency efforts, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disaster occurred at Old Kijabe dam, a hillside barrier formed naturally over decades after railway construction work by Kenya's former British colonial rulers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Red Cross has set up a desk at a local school to help families find lost loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the government had called for inspections of all dams and reservoirs within 24 hours in case there is a need for evacuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said on X that the authorities would arrest people engaging in "risky behaviour," including motorists attempting dangerous crossings and anyone seeking to transport "passengers across flooded rivers or storm water by unsafe canoes or boats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a crowded boat capsized at the weekend in flooded Tana River county in eastern Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kindiki said two bodies had been found and 23 people rescued, and that search and rescue efforts were ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kenyan government spokesman said on Monday that 103 people had lost their lives in floods since March, in a statement that did not mention the dam disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 28,000 households have been displaced and over 185,000 people affected, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The education ministry announced on Monday it would postpone the reopening of schools following mid-term holidays to May 6 because of the rains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weather has also wreaked havoc in neighbouring Tanzania, where at least 155 people have been killed in flooding and landslides. (AFP)

    Blinken 'hopeful' Hamas will accept Gaza deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday he was hopeful Hamas would accept an "extraordinarily generous" offer to halt Israel's Gaza offensive in return for the release of hostages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel," Blinken said in Riyadh at the World Economic Forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to decide – and they have to decide quickly," Blinken said. "I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can have a fundamental change in the dynamic" in more than half-a-year of bloodshed, Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A delegation from Hamas was due on Monday in Egypt, which with Qatar has been seeking to broker a deal that would halt the Israeli offensive and see hostages freed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also discussed the ceasefire proposal on Monday in Riyadh with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, where Hamas maintains an office and the militants' chief Ismail Haniyeh is a frequent visitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken in the talks with Fidan "urged that all efforts be brought to bear to convince Hamas to accept the immediate ceasefire proposal that is on the table," a State Department statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey recognises Israel but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a strident critic of its Gaza offensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erdogan has voiced an eagerness for a greater role in mediating the Gaza conflict after Qatar in recent weeks indicated it would take a step back. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751063_1_L_20240429174052.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday said that after a period of reflection about his future he had decided to continue as the country's leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said he had informed King Felipe VI of his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His decision to continue draws a line under a week in which Spanish politics was thrown into further turmoil by the prospect of facing another parliamentary vote to choose a new prime minister or even a fourth general election in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, 52, surprised both foes and allies alike when he said last Wednesday he was taking several days away from public duty to consider quitting, provoking large demonstrations from his followers in the country over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his announcement on the same day a court said it would investigate his wife, Begona Gomez, for influence peddling and business corruption, allegations he said were false and orchestrated by his conservative opponents. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is welcomed upon arrival in Riyadh as he visits Saudi Arabia in the latest Gaza diplomacy push.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday arrived in Riyadh at the start of a new trip to the Middle East aimed at pushing for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and increasing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat will also visit Jordan and Israel on his seventh visit to the region since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the Israeli assault on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Saudi Arabia, Blinken was expected hold new talks with the Saudi leadership on potential normalisation of relations with Israel, a US State Department official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia was considering the step -- which would carry massive significance as the kingdom is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites -- before October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has sought to keep up momentum, dangling the prospect of normalisation to encourage moderation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a long-time opponent of Palestinian statehood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will also meet in Riyadh with a number of Gulf Arab and European foreign ministers who are visiting for a World Economic Forum meeting and Gulf Cooperation Council talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will discuss "day-after" plans for reconstruction of post-war Gaza, according to the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans could include funding to rebuild Gaza -- the vast majority of whose people have been displaced -- or support for installing new governance structures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived hours after US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone about ongoing talks to halt Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for the release of hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce between Israel and Hamas for months, as public pressure mounts for a deal. (AFP)

Four dead after tornadoes strike Oklahoma

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least four people died, including a four-month-old baby, and scores were injured in the state of Oklahoma after dozens of twisters swept the US Southern Plains, while weather alerts on Sunday put more than 7 million Americans under tornado warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Sunday declared a disaster emergency for the state, freeing up more money for first responders and recovery operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Definitely the most damage since I've been governor," Stitt said in Sulphur, one of the hardest-hit communities, as he provided an update on fatalities and damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stitt began his first term as governor in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a call with the Oklahoma governor, President Joe Biden offered the full support of the federal government to help with the recovery efforts, the White House said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storm warnings for high winds, heavy rain and hail also were issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) on Sunday for more than 47 million people stretching from East Texas north through Illinois and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NWS reported 38 possible twisters hit the area and that the worst of the storms rolled through Central Oklahoma on Saturday into early Sunday morning, spreading into northwest Texas, western Missouri and Kansas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said area hospitals reported 100 injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twisters destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, including the hospital in the town of Marietta, although no injuries were reported there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20,000 customers in the state remained without power as of Sunday evening, according to officials, as emergency personnel worked to clear roads and repair power lines. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will host a meeting of state and territory leaders on Wednesday to discuss a coordinated response towards violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands protested in cities around the country at the weekend to draw attention to the deaths of 27 women so far this year allegedly caused by acts of gender-based violence in a population of 27 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese on Monday described domestic violence as a “national crisis”, and said the rallies were a call to action for all levels of Australian government to do more to prevent gender-based violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Quite clearly, we need to do more. It’s not enough to just have empathy,” Albanese told Nine Network television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact that... a woman dies every four days on average at the hand of a partner is just a national crisis,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 17 rallies held across Australia over the weekend, with an estimated 15,000 people demonstrating in the city of Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese, his Women’s Minister Katy Gallagher and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth received a hostile response when they attended a rally in the capital Canberra on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters yelled at the government leaders, “we want action” and “do your job.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said there needed to be more focus on perpetrators and prevention of violence. “We need to change the culture, we need to change attitudes, we need to change the legal system,” he told the rally. (AP)

    Ukraine warns the situation in the east has 'worsened'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ukrainian forces are banking on swift deliveries of weapons and ammunition from the US. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750959_1_L_20240429041846.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's army leader admitted on Sunday that Kyiv's position on the battlefield has worsened after Russian forces captured another village in the east, pressing their advantage in manpower and ammunition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia's troops are advancing in the eastern Donetsk region as Kyiv awaits the arrival of much-needed US weapons that it hopes will stabilise the fragile front lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation at the front has worsened," Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a Facebook post on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian troops had "retreated" westwards to new defensive lines in a section of the front that runs past the city of Donetsk, controlled by pro-Russian forces since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has "a significant advantage in forces and means" and had been able to notch up advances amid "heavy fighting," Syrsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some sectors the enemy had tactical success, and in some areas our troops managed to improve the tactical position," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday claimed its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka in the Donetsk region – around 10 kilometres north of Avdiivka, which they seized in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stark assessment of the picture facing Ukrainian troops comes at the end of week of ups and downs for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States finally approved a US$61 billion package of financial aid after months of political wrangling, unlocking much-needed arms for Ukraine's stretched troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on the battlefield Russia chalked up more successes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Sunday and "reviewed ongoing talks" to free hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack on Israel, the White House said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two allies "reviewed ongoing talks to secure the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza," the White House statement said, as diplomatic efforts intensified to reach a long-sought truce in the war-battered region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli government has come under intense pressure from its global allies to reach a ceasefire, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by the Palestinian militant group during the attack that triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Netanyahu "also discussed increases in the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza including through preparations to open new northern crossings starting this week," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The President stressed the need for this progress to be sustained and enhanced in full coordination with humanitarian organisations," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With humanitarian agencies sounding ever more dire warnings of a crisis in Gaza, Israel has come under increasing pressure – globally and from the United States specifically – to allow more aid into the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also "reiterated his clear position" on any Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has vowed to send troops into Rafah, where more than 1.5 million civilians have taken refuge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden administration, while backing Israel, has repeatedly voiced alarm over the heavy toll on civilians in the Gaza offensive and has pressed Israel to hold off on any Rafah assault. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Meteorologists are warning of the danger of more extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750954_1_L_20240429013412.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An exceptional number of powerful tornadoes have ravaged parts of Oklahoma and nearby Great Plains states in the US, with one small town reportedly hit by two separate tornadoes within hours, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After 78 tornadoes were reported on Friday, mostly in Nebraska and Iowa, a separate weather system on Saturday brought 35 tornado reports from northern Texas to Missouri, the National Weather Service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least two people, including a four-month-old child, died in the Oklahoma town of Holdenville, according to multiple reports in state and local media, though crews on Sunday were still sifting through the mounds of rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storms dumped up to 18 centimetres of rain in some places within hours, and meteorologists warned of a continuing danger of extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos and images posted on social media showed scores of building flattened in the small town of Sulphur, in south-central Oklahoma, with vehicles smashed or overturned and trees stripped of branches and leaves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postal trucks in Sulphur rested precariously atop the nearly unrecognisable wreckage of buildings, one video showed. Rescue crews went house to house and vehicle to vehicle in search of victims or survivors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "DO NOT COME TO SULPHUR UNLESS YOU ARE A FIRST RESPONDER!!!" the Murray County sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tornado that struck Ardmore, Oklahoma tossed debris up to 6,100 metres high, the Washington Post reported. Then two other tornadoes came close to the town in the ensuing two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt declared a 30-day state of emergency to expedite aid to 12 of the hardest-hit counties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 50,000 homes in Texas and more than 30,000 in Oklahoma were without power as of late Sunday morning, the poweroutage.us website reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The region is known for the frequency and power of the tornadoes that rumble through every spring. But having separate major outbreaks in succeeding days is exceedingly rare, meteorologists said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Diplomatic efforts intensified on Sunday to reach a long sought-after truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza, as Hamas said it would travel to mediator Egypt to deliver its response to Israel's latest proposal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli government has come under intense pressure to reach a ceasefire from its global allies, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by Hamas during their October 7 attack that triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas delegation will arrive in Egypt on Monday to deliver the group's response to Israel's new hostage and truce counterproposal, a senior official of the militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire – a condition that Israel has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the Axios news website, citing two Israeli officials, reported that Israel's latest proposal includes a willingness to discuss the "restoration of sustainable calm" in Gaza after hostages are released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first time in the nearly seven-month war that Israeli leaders have suggested they are open to discussing an end to the war, Axios said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas source close to the negotiations said that the group "is open to discussing the new proposal positively."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The source added that the group is "keen to reach an agreement that guarantees a permanent ceasefire, the free return of displaced people, an acceptable deal for (prisoner) exchange and ensuring an end to the siege" in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new hopes of a potential truce came as world leaders and humanitarian groups warned that a looming Israeli invasion of the southernmost city of Rafah would lead to massive civilian causalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas appealed to the US to stop Israel from invading Rafah, which he said would be "the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people." (AFP)

    Nearly 200 detained in US campus protests

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pro-Palestinian protesters stand in front of a police barricade after officers raid an encampment at Northeastern University in Boston. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750889_2_L_20240428112831.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police detained nearly 200 people at three US universities on Saturday as they cleared pro-Palestinian encampments, in the latest campus clashes triggered by protests over Israel's war against Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the East Coast, police in Boston detained about 100 people while clearing a protest camp at Northeastern University, with social media posts showing security forces in riot gear and officers loading tents onto the back of a truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action was taken after some protesters resorted to "virulent anti-Semitic slurs, including 'Kill the Jews,'" Northeastern University said in a statement on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the opposite side of the country, Arizona State University police arrested 69 people for trespassing after the group set up an "unauthorised encampment" on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arizona State officials said a protest group – "most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff" – had set up a camp on Friday and then ignored repeated orders to disperse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in the US heartland, police at Indiana University arrested 23 people as they cleared a campus protest camp, the Indiana Daily Student newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police with shields, batons and other riot gear broke through a line of protesters who had linked arms, tackling those who did not move, the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campus activists are calling for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas, as well as for colleges to sever ties with the country and with companies they say profit from the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protests have posed a major challenge to university administrators who are trying to balance commitments to free expression with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have carried out large-scale arrests at universities in recent days, at times using chemical irritants and tasers to disperse demonstrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on X, Northeastern said the area on campus where the protests were held was now "fully secured" and "all campus operations have returned to normal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said it made the move after "what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organisers with no affiliation to Northeastern."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that detained individuals who produced a valid school ID have been released and will face disciplinary proceedings, not legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Those who refused to disclose their affiliation were arrested," the school said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of students remained encamped on Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania, despite the college president ordering disbandment after what he said were "credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York, where the protests originated, was relatively calm. Officials there announced on Friday that they would not be calling police back to campus after more than 100 people were arrested last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To bring back the NYPD at this time would be counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community," school leaders said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada saw its first campus protest camp spring up on Saturday at McGill University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school in Montreal said such encampments, which are not permitted, increase "the potential for escalation and confrontation, as we have seen at some colleges throughout the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas militants staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militants also took roughly 250 people hostage. Israel estimates 129 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,388 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Cambodian army base blast kills 20 soldiers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An ammunition explosion at a base in southwestern Cambodia killed 20 soldiers and wounded several others, Prime Minister Hun Manet said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hun Manet said in a Facebook post that he was “deeply shocked” when he received the news of the blast on Saturday afternoon at the base in Kampong Speu province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn't immediately clear what caused it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images from the scene showed several badly damaged buildings still smoldering, at least one with its roof blown off, and soldiers receiving treatment in a hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other photos showed houses with holes in their roofs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four buildings – three for storage and one work facility – were destroyed and several military vehicles damaged, Colonel Youeng Sokhon, an army officer at the site, said in a brief report to army chief General Mao Sophan, posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that 25 villagers' homes were damaged as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kiripost, an online English language news service, quoted a nearby resident as saying a major explosion occurred at about 2.30pm, followed by smaller blasts for another hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pheng Kimneang was quoted as saying the windows of a factory nearby were shattered, and homes as far as a kilometre (a half-mile) away suffered minor damage. Photos of the base show it in a large field, apparently with no civilian structures close by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hun Manet offered condolences to the soldiers’ families and promised the government would pay for their funerals and provide compensation both to those killed and those wounded. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of people protested in Australian cities on Saturday, demanding more be done to stop violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At events in Sydney and Adelaide, demonstrators carried banners saying "no excuse for abuse" and asked the government to step in and prevent violence that has claimed dozens of lives already this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese backed the protests and vowed to march at further events planned for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A woman has been killed every four days so far this year," he posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I will walk with women across Australia to say enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Governments need to do better, men need to step up and as a society, we must do better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also took part in a demonstration in Sydney, and said change was desperately needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of violence against women has come to the fore in Australia after a spate of high-profile murder cases and a knife attack on a Sydney mall that left five women dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, police arrested former "Home and Away" actor Orpheus Pledger, after he allegedly failed to appear in court to face charges of assaulting a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers in the advocacy group What Were You Wearing have called three days of protests from Friday to Sunday, saying "29 Women have been killed to men's violence since the start of 2024. Enough is enough." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Min Hee-jin, CEO of HYBE's sub-label Ador, attends a press conference in Seoul. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750837_1_L_20240427181538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The creative director behind the girl band NewJeans has found online fame after a tearful, profanity-laced news conference in which she slammed some of K-pop's most powerful executives.
 <br>
  <br/>
  HYBE, the South Korean agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, filed a legal complaint on Thursday against Min Hee-jin, the head of its powerhouse subsidiary label ADOR, for breach of trust in business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed an announcement three days earlier that it had launched an audit of ADOR and demanded that Min resign. HYBE's share price fell close to 10 percent after the audit was announced and closed on Friday down 4.95 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, 44, hit back in a news conference on Thursday that drew empathy online from young working men and women who compared her story with their own experiences with unreasonable and jealous bosses who either took credit for their work or failed to acknowledge it fairly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, however, said she had acted inappropriately and unprofessionally by occasionally lapsing into profanity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She denied HYBE's accusations and claimed it was trying to dismiss her unfairly after she accused another of its subsidiaries, BELIFT LAB, of imitating NewJeans with a girl group of its own called ILLIT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, speaking off the cuff and often breaking down in tears, candidly shared her frustrations for more than two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She referred to HYBE's leaders, including chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the man behind BTS, as "gaejeossi", which translates roughly to a "middle-aged or old male fool".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel betrayed by HYBE... they used me until I was no longer of use to them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The live-streamed event, during which even her lawyers appeared embarrassed, had millions of views and drew an explosive public response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parody YouTube video seen by 2.5 million viewers combined a clip of Min speaking passionately with hip-hop music. The t-shirt and baseball cap she was wearing sold out on several online platforms and many others said they had suffered similar experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women who have truly worked (hard) and experienced being undermined by men, along with the dirty side of office politics, could never speak ill of Min Hee-jin," a South Korean woman said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee Moon-won, a culture critic who watched the news conference, said Min sidestepped the real allegations against her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No figure as influential as Min in the entertainment industry has ever used curse words during an official press conference, people have really never seen anything like it, so this obviously has attracted enormous attention," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As one of few successful women producers in the industry, Min has been recognised for her arresting visual imagery on numerous K-pop hits, including Girls' Generation's "Gee" and EXO's "Growl".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min said HYBE chairman Bang never congratulated her on NewJeans' debut and that the parent company had given promotional priority to another of its K-pop groups, Le Sserafim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HYBE rejected Min's accusations and urged her again to resign and stop discussing NewJeans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts criticised both Min and HYBE over a scandal that has gripped much of South Korea.

  <br/>
  K-pop columnist Isak Choi said those involved showed "incompetence and vulgarity by not hesitating to publicly display infighting".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just because Min criticised HYBE's leadership, "it doesn't mean she is free from the rotten issues of this industry", Choi wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She cannot become the underdog simply because she is fighting with the management, especially after having gained astronomical benefits from within it." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said it was studying on Saturday the latest Israeli counter proposal regarding a potential ceasefire in Gaza, a day after a delegation from mediator Egypt reportedly arrived in Israel in a bid to jump-start stalled negotiations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The signs of fresh truce talks came alongside ongoing Israeli preparations for a military push into Gaza's southern city of Rafah and as spillover from the war led to continued attacks across the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, the Hamas movement received the official Zionist occupation response to the movement's position, which was delivered to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators on April 13," Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of Hamas's political arm in Gaza, said in a brief statement early Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement will study this proposal, and upon completion of its study, it will submit its response."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas had previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire, something rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been unsuccessfully trying to seal a new truce deal in Gaza ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Israeli media outlets, citing unnamed officials, said Israel's war cabinet had discussed a new plan for a truce and hostage release ahead of the Egyptian delegation's visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been "noticeable progress in bringing the views of the Egyptian and Israeli delegations closer", said Al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egyptian state intelligence services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza was also on the agenda for an international summit set to kick off in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Economic Forum special meeting, scheduled to begin in Riyadh on Sunday, will include a Gaza-focused session on Monday set to feature newly appointed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations aid coordinator for the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discussions with European, American and regional counterparts on Gaza and the regional situation are planned in Riyadh," a diplomatic source said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses in besieged Gaza reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight into Saturday around Rafah, the last urban centre Israeli ground forces have yet to enter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans for an Israeli incursion into the city, which military leaders say is necessary to uproot Hamas battalions, have sparked opposition among the international community due to the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians seeking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told AFP on Thursday that such an operation "will undoubtedly threaten the negotiations" and show "that Israel is interested in continuing the war".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with the unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,170 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,356 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel estimates that 129 hostages are still being held by Hamas in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead. (AFP)

    Trump lawyers cross examine ex-tabloid publisher

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A courtroom sketch depicts David Pecker being cross examined by Emil Bove during former President Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence a porn star. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750763_1_L_20240427021510.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former tabloid publisher who squashed potentially embarrassing stories about Donald Trump was back on the witness stand on Friday being grilled by lawyers of the former US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  David Pecker, 72, has testified for four days in the trial of Trump, accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter that could have derailed his 2016 White House campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker, the first witness in the blockbuster trial, has outlined under questioning from prosecutors a scheme known as "catch and kill," which involved purchasing and then burying salacious stories which could have been damaging to the real estate tycoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of engaging in "election fraud" by having his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-stakes trial requires Trump to report to the drafty Manhattan courtroom multiple times a week, restricting his time on the campaign trail less than seven months before his likely election rematch with President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters in a hallway before entering court on Friday, Trump wished his wife, Melania, a happy birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It'd be nice to be with her but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker, whose outlets included the National Enquirer tabloid, testified this week about a hush money payment to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed to have had a year-long affair with Trump that was a precursor to the Daniels saga.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker explained how transfers to the tune of US$150,000 were made to "catch and kill" McDougal's story and suppress its publication, calling it a "large purchase" relative to the sums his company would normally pay for content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said payments to McDougal were disguised as services to American Media, the tabloid's parent company, to avoid violating campaign finance laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We purchased the story so it would not be published by any other organization," Pecker told the jury. "We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or hurt his campaign."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDougal's story ultimately did come out, four days before the election in a scoop from The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said Trump called him and was "very upset."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When it came to squashing Daniels' tale of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, Pecker said he hesitated to pay for yet another story.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not a bank," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The executive suggested to Cohen that he pay for it instead, which prosecutors say the then-Trump fixer did.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The specific charge facing Trump of falsifying business records stems from his reimbursements to Cohen for the payment to Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During defence cross-examination which began on Thursday, Emil Bove, a Trump attorney sought to ruffle Pecker by noting timeline inconsistencies, while also casting the "catch and kill" tactics described by prosecutors as "business as usual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has appeared increasingly disgruntled, angry even, as the trial proceeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He complained on Friday that the courtroom was "freezing" and that it was "on purpose I believe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

    King Charles eases back into royal duties

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British head of state King Charles III will make a limited return to public duties next week, after doctors said they were "very encouraged" by the progress of his treatment for cancer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His first engagement with Queen Camilla would be to a cancer treatment centre on Tuesday. The couple will also host Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan for a state visit in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement follows a difficult spell for the royal family after both Charles, 75, and his 42-year-old daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed that they had cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine, the wife of heir to the throne Prince William, made the shock announcement that she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy just over a month ago in a video posted to social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Announcing Charles's limited return, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said it was "too early to say" how much longer his treatment would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they noted that his medical team were "very encouraged by the progress made so far and remain positive about the king's continued recovery".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pacing of the king's programme will be carefully calibrated as his recovery continues, in close consultation with his medical team," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The king and Queen Camilla will host the Japanese royal couple at Buckingham Palace in late June, the palace said, confirming reports in the Japanese media last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese royals both attended the state funeral of Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in September 2022, in their first overseas trip after the emperor's enthronement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also attended the reception the king hosted at Buckingham Palace the evening before the funeral for heads of state and official overseas guests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier state visit which had been planned for early 2020 had to be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. (AFP)

    Biden 'happy to debate' Trump

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden has branded his Republican opponent in the presidential race as a threat to democracy. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750761_1_L_20240427014751.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden said on Friday he's ready to face off against his White House challenger Donald Trump in a debate ahead of their likely presidential rematch in November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Candidate debates have been important milestones in US presidential elections for decades, helping make or break voters' opinions of the contestants' personal style and demeanor as much as their policy chops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden's team has for months been non-committal about his willingness to participate in the tradition, which is usually held in front of an audience and moderated by a well-known journalist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy to debate him," Biden told radio host Howard Stern Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am, somewhere. I don't know when," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ok, let's set it up!" Trump campaign advisor Chis LaCivita said on X, formerly Twitter, in response to Biden's comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presumptive Republican nominee Trump declined to face off against his primary opponents in any debates during the 2024 cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he has indicated his eagerness with the man who beat him in 2020, saying on social media earlier this year that he was ready to hold a presidential debate with Biden "ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, who has branded Trump as a threat to democracy, told reporters last month that any agreement to debate the real estate mogul "depends on his behaviour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has already arranged three dates and locations for Trump and Biden to go head-to-head for the 2024 fight, at US universities throughout the country in September and October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trump bashed the CPD as being biased toward Democrat Biden when in 2020 it planned to move a third and final debate to a virtual format amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then-president Trump had himself shown up to the second 2020 debate against Biden only three days before testing positive for Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden at the time had said he would not participate in another in-person debate with Trump while the Republican was still ill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A verbal spar could be a useful opportunity for both the 77-year-old former president and 81-year-old current president to display stamina, as Biden is still dogged by Trump's old "Sleepy Joe" nickname -- and Trump faced online teasing when he appeared to nod off during his criminal trial in New York last week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Round two of India's national election began on Friday to select more than 540 members of parliament. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750660_1_L_20240426124631.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as polarisation grows over Prime Minister Narendra Modi whipping up an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics in his campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Voting opened at 7am in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But turnout in the first round of voting last week dropped nearly four points to 66 percent from the last election in 2019, with speculation in Indian media that higher-than-average temperatures were to blame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second round of the poll -- conducted in phases to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country -- includes districts that have this week seen temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outcome of Friday’s voting across 88 constituencies in 13 states with 160 million voters will be crucial for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls predict a win for Modi and the BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 970 million voters will elect 543 members from a total 28 states to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered election that runs until June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The votes will be counted on June 4. (Agencies)

 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Thursday inspected the test-firing of 240 mm multiple-launch rockets manufactured by a newly-established defence industry unit, the North's KCNA news agency reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report did not give further details of the unit that produced the artillery. North Korea is believed to be ramping up production of artillery amid allegations by the United States and South Korea that it is supplying Russia with weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both countries deny the allegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The test firing showed the rockets met the required standards for flight characteristics and accuracy, KCNA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim said the 240 mm multiple launch rocket system, which incorporates new technology, will "bring about a strategic change in strengthening our military's artillery capabilities," according to KCNA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate report, KCNA said Kim visited the Kim Il Sung Military University, named after his grandfather and state founder, to mark the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary army, the precursor to the country's military. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned on Thursday and a transitional council took power with the aim of returning stability to a country where gang violence has caused chaos and misery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry's former finance minister, Michel Patrick Boisvert, will be interim prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic, this day in effect opens a view to a solution... to the multidimensional crises the country faces," Boisvert said after the formal swearing-in of the nine-person transitional council on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top police and military officials and members of the transitional council stood behind Boisvert during the ceremony, hosted at the prime minister's office known as Villa d'Accueil, which was surrounded by military and a security detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry announced last month he would resign once the council was in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left Haiti in February to seek international help for police in their battles with armed and powerful gangs. But he was left stranded outside the country as the gangs threatened to completely take over the capital. Struggling to return, Henry announced his intended resignation. Boisvert had served as acting prime minister in Henry's absence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transitional government's mandate runs until February 2026, by when there are slated to be elections, and cannot be renewed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the path to getting to elections was long, and there were already tensions within the council as different factions jostled for power, said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite the installation, there is still a long and rocky road ahead for the council to be able to forge a government," Da Rin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The naming of the council is also seen as key step towards the deployment of a multinational security mission. Kenya had offered to head that mission but then put it on pause as the security situation deteriorated, saying it would re-evaluate once a new government was in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the multinational force to happen quickly to help tackle the "dire" situation, his spokesperson said on Thursday. (Reuters)

    Climate change wipes 10pc off wine production

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wine producers say climate change is harming grape harvests. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750585_1_L_20240426023611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World wine production dropped 10 percent last year, the biggest fall in more than six decades, because of "extreme" climate changes, the body that monitors the trade said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Extreme environmental conditions" including droughts, fires and other problems with climate were mostly to blame for the drastic fall, said the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) that covers nearly 50 wine producing countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia and Italy suffered the worst, with 26 and 23 percent drops. Spain lost more than a fifth of its production. Harvests in Chile and South Africa were down by more than 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The OIV said the global grape harvest was the worst since 1961, and worse even than its early estimates in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In further bad news for winemakers, customers drank three per cent less wine in 2023, the French-based intergovernmental body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director John Barker highlighted "drought, extreme heat and fires, as well as heavy rain causing flooding and fungal diseases across major northern and southern hemisphere wine producing regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although he said climate problems were not solely to blame for the drastic fall, "the most important challenge that the sector faces is climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know that the grapevine, as a long-lived plant cultivated in often vulnerable areas, is strongly affected by climate change," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France bucked the falling harvest trend, with a four percent rise, making it by far the world's biggest wine producer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine consumption last year was however at its lowest level since 1996, confirming a fall-off over the last five years, according to the figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trend is partly due to price rises caused by inflation and a sharp fall in wine drinking in China – down a quarter.

    US top court ponders 'rule for the ages' in Trump case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters outside the US Supreme Court urge the justices to reject Trump's arguments on immunity. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750582_1_L_20240426013833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court heard arguments on Thursday on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution and appeared poised to issue a ruling that could further delay Donald Trump's trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic case -- the last in the court's current term – has far-reaching implications for executive power and Trump's multiple legal issues as he seeks the White House again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're writing a rule for the ages," said Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of three conservative justices appointed to the nation's highest court by the former Republican president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least four, and possibly five, of the conservative justices on the nine-member court appeared to take issue with a lower court ruling that a former president does not enjoy "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution after leaving office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, told Michael Dreeben, representing Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the election conspiracy charges against Trump, that he had "concerns" with the lower court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As I read it, it says simply, 'a former president can be prosecuted because he's being prosecuted,'" Roberts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why shouldn't we either send (the case) back to the Court of Appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that's not the law?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sending the case back to the lower court for further review would almost certainly delay Trump's election conspiracy trial until after the November vote, when he is expected to face off once again against Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Justice Samuel Alito, another conservative, asked why – without immunity – a president won't just "pardon themselves from anything that they might have been conceivably charged with committing?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Sauer, representing Trump, told the court that "without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution there can be no presidency as we know it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every current president will face de facto blackmail and extortion by his political rivals while he is still in office," Sauer said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Scottish Green Party will vote against Scotland's Humza Yousaf in a vote of no confidence in him as first minister, a source within the party said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yousaf's other opponents said earlier on Thursday they would seek to oust him as Scotland's leader after his Scottish National Party abandoned a coalition with the Greens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yousaf, who serves as first minister in Scotland's devolved government, ended the alliance on Thursday. The arrangement had come under strain after a decision to scrap a climate change emissions reduction target last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNP has led Scotland's devolved government since 2011, but its fortunes faltered since a funding scandal and the resignation of a party leader last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party holds broadly centre-left views, but its coalition with the Greens had highlighted splits over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters on social and environmental issues beyond its core call for independence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, a YouGov poll put the main British opposition Labour Party slightly ahead of the SNP in Scotland for the first time since Scottish voters chose to remain part of the United Kingdom in an independence referendum in 2014. (Reuters)

    NY court overturns Weinstein rape conviction

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harvey Weinstein's 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned by New York's highest court, reopening the landmark case that launched the #MeToo movement and highlighting the challenges of holding powerful men accountable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a bitterly divided 4-3 decision on Thursday, the state Court of Appeals said the trial judge made a critical mistake by letting women testify that Weinstein assaulted them, even though their accusations were not part of the charges he faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined on a broad range of "loathsome" conduct, including bullying and fits of anger toward associates, that portrayed him in a "highly prejudicial" light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behaviour that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges," Judge Jenny Rivera wrote for the majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a prison in upstate Rome, New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is not expected to be freed immediately, as he also faces a separate 16-year prison term in California after being convicted there last year for the 2013 rape of an actress at a Los Angeles hotel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose predecessor Cyrus Vance brought the New York case, will decide whether to retry Weinstein.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault," Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg, said in an email. (Reuters)

    Landmark 'Moulin Rouge' in Paris loses windmill blades

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The blades of the windmill on top of the Moulin Rouge cabaret, one of the most famous landmarks in Paris, collapsed during the night, firefighters on Thursday said, just months before the French capital hosts the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The letters M, O and U had also been toppled from the name spelled out on the building's facade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the reason for the accident was not yet known, the Moulin Rouge's director Jean-Victor Clerico said there was no sign of "foul play", adding the cause was "obviously a technical problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No-one was hurt and there was no risk of further collapse, Paris firefighters said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. The club was founded in 1889 and the audience for its dance shows is largely made up of tourist groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of people watch the cabaret's daily shows each year, with many more stopping to look from the outside at the landmark at the foot of the Montmartre hill. (Agencies)

    House Speaker heckled as protests spread on campuses

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Students at the encampment on the Columbia University campus say their protest is peaceful. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750502_1_L_20240425160736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University students heckled US House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as he visited the flashpoint of nationwide student demonstrations over the Israeli war in Gaza, even as the New York school agreed to 48 more hours of negotiations to end a protest encampment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Johnson's visit, which he said was meant to support Jewish students intimidated by some anti-Israeli demonstrators, took place shortly after the university extended a deadline from Wednesday morning to Friday morning to reach an agreement to remove an encampment that has come to symbolise the campus protest movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the campus protests taking place coast to coast were met with shows of force from law enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Texas on Wednesday, state highway patrol troopers in riot gear and police on horseback broke up a protest at the University of Texas in Austin and arrested 20 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Southern California declared its campus closed and asked the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to clear a demonstration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police arrested students who peacefully surrendered one-by-one, hours after campus police who took down an encampment were overwhelmed by protesters and requested LAPD help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other demonstrations took place at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and California State Polytechnic in Humboldt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesting students have demanded universities divest assets from Israel and seek to pressure the US government to rein in Israeli strikes on Palestinian civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's fierce response followed a deadly October 7 cross-border raid by Islamist militants from Hamas, which controls the Gaza enclave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The at times vulgar heckling and booing that greeted Johnson did not drown him out, though he was hard to hear because he spoke to media microphones, not through loudspeakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Columbia has allowed these lawless radicals and agitators to take over, the virus of anti-semitism has spread across other campuses," Johnson said from the steps of the university library, calling on violent protesters to be arrested and threatening to cut off federal funding to universities that fail impose order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a politically polarised country, conservatives can score points by being seen as standing up to liberal activists, many of whom say the Republican portrayals of anti-semitic violence on campus are greatly exaggerated for political purposes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson also met with Jewish students who said they were fearful to come onto the campus, citing testimony from Jewish students who said they had been spat on and seen swastikas drawn on the walls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before his press conference, Johnson met with about 40 Jewish students on campus, according to students who were there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students at the encampment say their protest has been peaceful, and that outsiders not connected with their movement are behind any inflammatory confrontations off-campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We regret that there's no attention on this peaceful movement and politicians are diverting attention from the real issues," said Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student at Columbia who has been part of the negotiations with school administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Free speech advocates PEN America called the sudden escalation at the University of Texas "deeply alarming."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The administration should be doing everything in their power to keep their students safe and the campus operating, but calling the state police to disperse a peaceful protest that had barely begun does the opposite," Kristen Shahverdian, PEN's campus free speech program director, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The political reverberations reached the White House, where press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden believes free speech, debate and non-discrimination are important on college campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to see this be peaceful," Jean-Pierre said in Wednesday's press briefing. "It is important that students feel safe... It should not be violent, it should not be hateful rhetoric." (Reuters)

 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he will suspend public duties until next week to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife's private dealings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, who last year secured another term for his Socialist party as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would appear before the media on Monday, April 29 to announce his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I need to pause and think," he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. "I urgently need an answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile (...) whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock announcement came after a Spanish court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into whether Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez committed a crime of influence peddling and corruption in business in her private dealings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court investigating Gomez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and preliminary, only saying it followed a complaint raised by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias – Clean Hands – whose leader has links to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manos Limpias said Gomez used her influence as the wife of the prime minister to allegedly secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo of the People's Party and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had "collaborated" with those circulating the claims against his wife.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ministers came out in support, with Energy Minister Teresa Ribera saying: "We have a first rate prime minister. Neither he nor his family deserve this." (Reuters)

HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750420_1_L_20240425014336.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    First Ukraine aid to arrive in hours: Biden

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law on Wednesday that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, notching a rare bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks reelection and ending months of wrangling with Republicans in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves from threats to their sovereignty," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill includes US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine and US$26 billion for Israel, as well as US$1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of the legislation was immediate. Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden blamed "MAGA Republicans" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin," he said. (Reuters)

    Boeing reports Q1 loss amid ongoing crisis

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

    Bill to ban TikTok in US clears Congress
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750299_1_L_20240424111040.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)

    Trump jury gets master class on burying negative press

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker told the NY court how he would suppress negative stories about Donald Trump. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750251_1_L_20240424035636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A colourful former tabloid publisher took the witness stand on Tuesday at Donald Trump's "hush money" trial and described how he suppressed negative stories about the real estate tycoon, a practice known as "catch and kill."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels over a 2006 sexual encounter that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors allege that Trump engaged in "election fraud" by having his then personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to the adult film actress on the eve of the 2016 election in which he defeated Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Pecker, 72, former publisher of the National Enquirer, was the first witness called to testify by prosecutors at Trump's high-stakes trial, which comes less than seven months ahead of his expected rematch against President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors are seeking with Pecker's testimony to demonstrate that the "catch and kill" scheme of squashing negative stories was one commonly used by Trump and Cohen, the once loyal "fixer" who has since turned against his former boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker took the stand after a nearly 90-minute hearing during which Judge Juan Merchan was asked by prosecutors to hold Trump in contempt of court for violating a partial gag order preventing him from publicly attacking witnesses, jurors or court staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan heard arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys but did not issue an immediate ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he has known Trump since 1989 and described him as a friend – "I would call him Donald."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said National Enquirer readers "loved" Trump, who starred in the hit reality television series "The Apprentice" before going into politics in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he agreed at an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower with Trump, Cohen and Trump's personal assistant Hope Hicks to help his friend's nascent campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said what I would do is, I would run or publish positive stories about Mr Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he would also warn Cohen about potential negative stories about Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I notified Michael Cohen of a story that was a negative story, he would try to vet it himself, see if the story was true or not," Pecker said. "And he would go to the individual publication to make sure the story wasn't published and get it killed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors walked Pecker through two payments made to squash negative stories. One involved a Trump Tower doorman who was peddling a false claim that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other involved a former Playboy magazine model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with the married Trump. She was paid US$150,000 not to go public with the story.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker is to return to the witness stand when the trial resumes on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Pecker testified, prosecutors – at a hearing held without the jury present – accused Trump of brazenly violating the gag order imposed by the judge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's "willful" attacks on witnesses "clearly violate" the gag order, prosecutor Chris Conroy said, urging the judge to fine him US$1,000 per violation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty," Conroy said, but the court should "remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and Cohen are both expected to appear as prosecution witnesses at the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has repeatedly attacked them on Truth Social, calling them, for example, "sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our country dearly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lashed out at the judge following the day's proceedings, calling the gag order "unconstitutional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not allowed to talk but people are allowed to talk about me," he said. "They can lie but I'm not allowed to say anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He complained that Biden is "out campaigning and I'm here in the courtroom."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very unfair situation." (AFP)

    UN calls for probe into deaths at Gaza hospitals

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health workers arrange bodies found at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750249_1_L_20240424023831.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations called on Tuesday for an international investigation into reports of mass graves at two Gaza hospitals destroyed in Israeli sieges, saying war crimes might have been committed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office said it was "horrified" by the destruction of Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, and its second largest, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday that health workers had uncovered nearly 340 bodies, updating an earlier figure, of Palestinians allegedly killed and buried by Israeli forces at the Nasser complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army dismissed claims that its troops had buried bodies during its operation at Nasser as "baseless and unfounded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office demanded "independent, effective and transparent investigations into the deaths."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals, which are protected under international law, have repeatedly come under Israeli bombardment over more than six months of war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has accused Palestinian militant group Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted during its attack inside Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has denied the claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law," Turk said. "And the intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de combat is a war crime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office said it did not have access to independent information as to what happened at the two hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said efforts were under way to corroborate reports and details given by Gazan authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victims had reportedly been buried deep in the ground and covered with waste," she told reporters in Geneva, adding that older people, women and wounded were reportedly among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were allegedly "found with their hands tied and stripped of their clothes." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK readied on Tuesday to start detaining migrants within days for deportation to Rwanda after the controversial plan got parliament's approval, sparking outrage from the UN and rights groups.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new legislation – a flagship policy of the Conservative government that aims to curb irregular cross-Channel migration from northern France – cleared its final hurdle after a marathon late-night parliamentary tussle on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just hours later French police said at least five migrants, including a child, died overnight during an attempt to cross the busy shipping lane in a small boat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the UK scheme, undocumented asylum seekers arriving in Britain would be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be examined and, if approved, would allow them to stay in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says deportations are expected to begin within 10-12 weeks, with migrants identified for the first flight due to be detained and held from as early as this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rwanda said it was "pleased" to see the bill passed and was looking forward to "welcoming those relocated to Rwanda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the heads of the UN agencies for refugees and human rights warned it threatened the rule of law and set "a perilous precedent globally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged the UK to instead "take practical measures to address irregular flows of refugees and migrants, based on international cooperation and respect for international human rights law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Council of Europe also called for the new law to be scrapped and said it raised "major issues about the human rights of asylum seekers and the rule of law more generally." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least five people have died while attempting to cross the English Channel, according to French authorities, hours after Britain approved its migrant deportation bill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The regional Voix du Nord newspaper said the bodies were discovered at the Wimereaux beach in northern France on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local officials said about 110 migrants were crowded onto a small boat when panic broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither local authorities nor the coast guard could say how many people had been rescued or could be missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coast guard was still carrying out search-and-rescue operations at sea, a spokesperson said, after what the official called a "busy" morning, with several crossing attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports of the deaths came only hours after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s latest effort to send some migrants on a one-way ticket to Rwanda finally won approval from Parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UK government plans to deport some of those who enter the country illegally as a deterrent to migrants who risk their lives in hopes they will be able to claim asylum once they reach Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Human rights groups have described the legislation as inhumane and cruel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the United Nations refugee agency and the Council of Europe called on Britain to rethink its plans for fears they could damage international cooperation on tackling the global migrant crisis. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Malaysian navy helicopters collided in mid-air during a rehearsal on Tuesday for a naval parade, killing all 10 crew members aboard, the country's navy said in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Naval officials said the incident occurred at the Lumut base in the western state of Perak on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All victims were confirmed dead at the scene and sent to the Lumut base military hospital for identification," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video circulating on local media showed several helicopters flying in formation, when one of the choppers' rotor clipped another before both aircraft crashed into the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The navy said it would carry out an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said the aircraft - a maritime operations helicopter and a Fennec military chopper - were rehearsing for a parade celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Royal Malaysian Navy, due to be held on Saturday. (Reuters)

    Albanese slams 'arrogant' Musk as X faces court blow

Albanese slams 'arrogant' Musk as X faces court blow
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750097_1_L_20240423095230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian court has ordered X to hide some posts commenting on the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney, deepening a war of words between the social media platform's owner Elon Musk and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia's federal court late on Monday granted the country's cyber regulator, the eSafety commissioner, a two-day injunction requiring the social media platform to hide some posts on a knife attack last week against an Assyrian church bishop, Mar Mari Emmanuel, during a service at his church.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese on Tuesday hit out at Musk, calling him an "arrogant billionaire" for pushing back against the Australian government's calls to take down the content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  X had blocked the content for its users in Australia but said it would not block the posts for users outside the country, arguing that the government had no authority to dictate content its users can see globally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos of the attack posted online showed the attacker, restrained by the congregation, shouting at the bishop for insulting Islam. Police have charged a 16-year-old with a terrorism offence over the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regulator had asked X to remove certain posts that publicly commented on the attack, which could include videos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Geoffrey Kennett, in an after-hours hearing, ordered X to block access to the posts until Wednesday afternoon, court documents showed. The matter will be considered again on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said social media must have social responsibility but Musk was fighting to keep violent content on his platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll do what's necessary to take on this arrogant billionaire who thinks he's above the law, but also above common decency," Albanese told national broadcaster ABC on Tuesday. "What the eSafety Commissioner is doing, is doing her job to protect the interests of Australians."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk had earlier called the eSafety commissioner the "Australian censorship commissar", drawing rebuke from Albanese who described X's fight against removing violent content as "extraordinary".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to take a moment to thank the PM for informing the public that this platform is the only truthful one," Musk said in a post on X hours before Albanese's comments on Tuesday. (Reuters)

    Nasa's Voyager 1 phones home after months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory fixed a single malfunctioning chip that was causing Voyager 1 to spout gibberish. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750051_1_L_20240423043314.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa's Voyager 1 probe – the most distant man-made object in the universe – is returning usable information to ground control following months of spouting gibberish, the US space agency announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The spaceship stopped sending readable data back to Earth on November 14, 2023, even though controllers could tell it was still receiving their commands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, teams working at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory discovered that a single malfunctioning chip was to blame, and devised a clever coding fix that worked within the tight memory constraints of its 46-year-old computer system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Voyager 1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems," the agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data again."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 was mankind's first spacecraft to enter the interstellar medium, in 2012, and is currently more than 15 billion miles from Earth. Messages sent from Earth take about 22.5 hours to reach the spacecraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its twin, Voyager 2, also left the solar system in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Voyager spacecraft carry "Golden Records" – 12-inch, gold-plated copper discs intended to convey the story of our world to extraterrestrials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include a map of our solar system, a piece of uranium that serves as a radioactive clock allowing recipients to date the spaceship's launch, and symbolic instructions that convey how to play the record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The contents of the record, selected for Nasa by a committee chaired by legendary astronomer Carl Sagan, include encoded images of life on Earth, as well as music and sounds that can be played using an included stylus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their power banks are expected to be depleted sometime after 2025. They will then continue to wander the Milky Way, potentially for eternity, in silence. (AFP)

    India's Modi accused of targeting Muslims in speech

India's Modi accused of targeting Muslims in speech
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750039_1_L_20240423021516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's main opposition Congress party filed a complaint to the Election Commission on Monday accusing Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "blatantly targeting" minority Muslims in a campaign speech.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's most populous country is constitutionally secular and its election code bans canvassing based on "communal feelings."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's muscular Hindu-first politics is a key part of his electoral appeal and his opponents accuse him of marginalising India's 200 million Muslim population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister usually steers away from explicit references to religion – the word "Hindu" does not appear in his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) 76-page election manifesto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But at a weekend election rally in Rajasthan, Modi claimed a previous Congress government had said that "Muslims have the first right over the nation's wealth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said if Congress won "it will be distributed among those who have more children. It will be distributed to the infiltrators."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Do you think your hard-earned money should be given to infiltrators? Would you accept this?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics said the phrases were references to Muslims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its complaint to the Election Commission, the Congress party said the "divisive, objectionable and malicious" comments were targeted at "a particular religious community" and amounted to "blatant and direct violations of electoral laws."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were "far worse than any ever made by a sitting Prime Minister in the history of India," the complaint said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congress party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters outside the Commission's office: "We hope concrete action will be taken."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi and the BJP are widely expected to coast to victory in India's marathon elections, which began last Friday and with the results due on June 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, Modi presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the site of a centuries-old mosque razed by Hindu zealots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BJP has frequently invoked the temple on the campaign trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia told reporters on Monday that Modi was calling "a spade a spade" and his remarks resonated with what people thought. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said on Monday the chief of its intelligence directorate has resigned after taking responsibility for failures leading to the unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Major General Aharon Haliva is the first high-ranking official to step down for failing to prevent the attack that shocked Israel and the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Major General Aharon Haliva, in coordination with the chief of the general staff, has requested to end his position, following his leadership responsibility as the head of the intelligence directorate for the events of October 7," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was decided that MG Aharon Haliva will end his position and retire from the IDF (army), once his successor is appointed in an orderly and professional process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his resignation letter, Haliva, who served in the force for 38 years, took responsibility for failing to prevent the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On Saturday, October 7th 2023, Hamas committed a deadly surprise attack against the state of Israel," he wrote in the letter, a copy of which was given to journalists by the military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The intelligence division under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I carry that black day with me ever since. Day after day, night after night. I will forever carry with me the terrible pain of the war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his letter, Haliva called for a "thorough investigation into factors and circumstances" that led to the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and is engaged in a blistering assault against the militant group which rules the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian territory's health ministry said 34,097 people have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza, most of them women and children. (AFP)

    Trump in NY court for start of criminal trial

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750038_1_L_20240422232243.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former US president Donald Trump arrived in court on Monday for opening statements in his criminal trial and condemned the high-stakes case as a "witch hunt" designed to derail his White House bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It's a very, very sad day in America," the 77-year-old Republican presidential candidate told reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, and lots of other places campaigning," he said. "This is a witch hunt and it's a shame and it comes out of Washington."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges and the case poses substantial risks to him less than seven months before his election rematch with President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecution witnesses are expected to include adult film actress Stormy Daniels – who says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, a claim he denies – and Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The identities of the jury's five women and seven men are being kept secret for their own protection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security was tight on Monday after a man set himself on fire last week outside the courthouse in an unrelated but gruesome incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to pay US$130,000 in "hush money" to Daniels to ensure an account of their alleged tryst did not get out ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged crime is less significant than the indictments stemming from Trump's attack on the 2020 election – which the Republican lost to Democrat Biden – and his hoarding of secret documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump could face jail time in the current case, although a fine or probation is more likely, analysts say. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military on Monday said North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile into the sea off South Korea's east coast, the latest in an apparent volley of tests by Pyongyang this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "North Korea has fired an unidentified missile into the East Sea," South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo also confirmed the launch, with the Japanese defence ministry saying "a suspected ballistic missile was launched from North Korea" in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japanese media reported the suspected missile fell outside Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul-based specialist site NK News said the "brief flight time, likely under 10 minutes, pointed to the launch involving a short-range ballistic missile or a multiple launch rocket system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest launch comes after UN sanctions monitoring against the nuclear-armed nation was upended last month by Russia. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape said Joe Biden's comments may have been a slip of the tongue.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape says his nation does not deserve to be labelled cannibals, and urged the US to clear up the remnants of the Second World War littered across the Pacific, after comments by President Joe Biden about his missing serviceman uncle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden had "appeared to imply his uncle was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down over PNG during WWII", Marape's office said in a statement late on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Biden's remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labelled as such," Marape said in the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I urge President Biden to get the White House to look into cleaning up these remains of WWII so the truth about missing servicemen like Ambrose Finnegan can be put to rest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has previously cited his personal connection with Papua New Guinea's wartime history on visits to Australia, telling the story of his uncle who died in a plane crash in May 1944.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden last week raised the possibility his uncle might have fallen victim to cannibals, after visiting a missing-in-action war memorial in Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historians say Papua New Guinea was crucial to the United States drive across the Pacific to liberate the Philippines in the Second World War, while Australia has said the wartime history showed the renewed strategic importance of its northern neighbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of the war remains sensitive among Pacific Islanders, however. Marape said his nation was "needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands remain littered with wartime human remains, plane wrecks, ship wrecks and tunnels, as well as leftover bombs which were still killing people, he said. (Reuters)

    Ambassador: Sino-US relations need more work

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Xie Feng said the Chinese and US sides had continued to work together in a number of areas. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749928_1_L_20240422092116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to the United States said on Saturday that the two countries need to keep working to improve relations amid "unprecedented challenges".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xie Feng made the comments at Harvard University ahead of a visit to Beijing this week by the top US diplomat, Antony Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether the younger generation can continue to enjoy the eight-decade-long peace and development as their parents did depends largely on whether China and the United States can find the right way to get along in the new era,” Xie said in comments released by the embassy on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xie said talks in California between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November had injected stability into the bilateral relationship and also formed a forward-looking “San Francisco vision”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since the meeting, the two sides have maintained interactions at various levels, and conducted dialogue and cooperation in areas including foreign policy, economy and trade, law enforcement, agriculture, and [military to military] relations,” Xie was quoted by the embassy as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ambassador acknowledged that there was competition between the two sides and said China would not shy away from such competition as long as it was fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He rejected as unfair US claims that China’s lead in areas such as electric vehicles and solar panels was a result of overcapacity, and criticised the US insistence that other countries ban exports of certain products to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrives in Beijing on Wednesday for three days of talks that are expected to cover the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as bilateral ties.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said Israel will increase "military pressure" on Palestinian militant group Hamas in a bid to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In the coming days we will increase the military and political pressure on Hamas because this is the only way to free our hostages," Netanyahu said in a video statement on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover, threatening to "deliver additional and painful blows" without specifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an international outcry, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the army will launch a ground assault on Rafah, a southern Gaza city so far spared an Israeli invasion where more than 1.5 million Palestinians have taken refuge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army has said some of the hostages abducted from southern Israel during Hamas's October 7 attack that sparked the war were being held in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement later on Sunday that "the chief of staff has approved the next steps for the war," without offering details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On Passover, it will be 200 days of captivity for the hostages... We will fight until you return home to us." (AFP)

    Seven killed at Sri Lanka motor race

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The red race car ploughed into the crowd at an unprotected part of the circuit. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749907_1_L_20240422041225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least seven people were killed and another 21 wounded when a race car ploughed into spectators at a packed motorsport event hosted by Sri Lanka's army on Sunday, police said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A driver crashed into the crowd on an unprotected stretch of the track at the Fox Hill circuit, which is maintained by the Sri Lankan army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video shared widely on social media showed track marshals waving yellow flags to warn other drivers to slow down after a car overturned on the track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drivers are seen speeding past in clouds of orange dust until a red car slams into the crowd, and people are heard screaming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 27 people were taken to hospital and seven of them succumbed to their injuries," spokesman Nihal Thalduwa said, adding that an eight-year-old girl was among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly before the crash, army chief Vikum Liyanage announced that the gates had been opened to spectators free of charge to promote motorsports, with the event being held for the first time in five years due to the Covid pandemic and the island's economic crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a very special day... we decided to allow anyone to come in free," Liyanage said, claiming that about 100,000 spectators were at the Fox Hill circuit, around 180 kilometres east of Colombo. (AFP)

    Crowds join Bondi Beach memorial for stabbing victims

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hundreds of people sat in a beachside park to light candles for the six victims. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749905_1_L_20240422023522.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds gathered at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Sunday for a candlelight memorial to the six people killed by a knife-wielding assailant at a nearby shopping mall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Many hundreds sat on the grass in a beachside park to grieve for the five women and a Pakistani male security guard who died in the April 13 attack at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killings stunned many Australians who are largely unaccustomed to such violent crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I heard this I cried. Because it is new to us. We don't have this happen often. It's a shock," said 56-year-old local cafe owner Daniela Pontidas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know a lot of people that were impacted in some way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like this has burst Australia's bubble a bit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Inggall, 50, said he had been at Bondi Junction in the morning hours before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These things don't happen often in Australia but when they do I think they have a profound impact," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it really moves the community, so I want to be a part of it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mentally ill knifeman, 40-year-old Joel Cauchi, was tracked down, shot and killed by police inspector Amy Scott, who attended the service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As waves crashed into the beach at dusk, a choir sang the hymn "Keep Your Loving Arms Around Me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Indigenous didgeridoo was played as people lit candles in the breezy evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Bondi is tough and this is a strong community, and we will get through this," said New South Wales Premier Chris Minns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese offered the condolences of the nation for the six lives "snatched away on that hardest of Saturday afternoons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We mourn for all the joy they should have known," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cauchi's parents say he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17 but stopped taking medication, later leaving their Queensland home and dropping out of treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His women victims were a designer, a volunteer surf lifesaver, the daughter of an entrepreneur, a Chinese university student, and a new mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old mother, Ashlee Good, handed over her bleeding nine-month-old girl Harriet to two strangers in desperation before being rushed to hospital where she died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The baby was also taken to hospital and is said to be doing well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shopping mall reopened for business on Friday in a sombre mood, with floral tributes to the dead piled up inside and shoppers stopping to sign a book of condolence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian leaders have praised the "heroes" of the Bondi attack, including the police and emergency responders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has granted permanent citizenship to Frenchman Damien Guerot who fended off the attacker with a bollard; and it is expected to do the same for wounded Pakistani security guard Muhammad Taha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the rarity of such crimes, two days after the mall attack an Assyrian Christian bishop was brutally stabbed during a livestreamed service in western Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bishop has said he is recovering in hospital. A 16-year-old suspect has been charged with committing "a terrorist act." (AFP)

    Gaza officials say 50 bodies exhumed at hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health workers search for more bodies in one of the mass graves at the Nasser Medical Complex. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749893_1_L_20240421232926.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence said on Sunday health workers had uncovered at least 50 bodies of people killed and buried by Israeli forces at a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it was checking the reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the civil defence agency said the remains were discovered in the courtyard of the Nasser Medical Complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Inside the Nasser Medical complex there are mass graves dug by the Israeli occupation ... we were shocked by the presence of bodies of 50 martyrs in one of the pits yesterday," Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the civil defence agency, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are continuing the search operation today and are waiting for all graves to be exhumed in order to give a final number of martyrs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He alleged some of those killed had been tortured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were no clothes on some bodies, which certainly indicates (the victims) faced torture and abuse," Bassal said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intense fighting raged in mid-February in the area of the hospital, and Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles surrounded it on March 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate statement on Sunday, Hamas condemned what it said was a "mass grave of those executed in cold blood and buried with military bulldozers in the hospital's courtyard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said more than 50 bodies had been recovered there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several of the bodies wrapped in white shrouds were later collected by relatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals in Gaza have not been spared in the Israeli assault, with the military accusing Hamas of using the facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted in the October 7 attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organisation said on April 6 that the Palestinian territory's largest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, had been reduced to ashes by an Israeli siege last month, leaving an "empty shell" containing many bodies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO staff who gained access to the devastated facility described horrifying scenes of bodies only partly buried, their limbs sticking out, and the stench of decomposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel is engaged in a sweeping military assault against Hamas militants in Gaza after they launched a attack on southern Israeli communities on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unprecedented assault resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, Israelis and foreigners, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 250 people were abducted to Gaza during the attack, of whom 129 remain captive, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has so far killed 34,097 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    One dead, seven missing after Japan helicopters crash

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person died and seven were missing on Sunday after an apparent accident overnight involving two Japanese military helicopters out to sea, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for Japan's Self-Defense Force (SDF) confirmed the late Saturday incident and said that one person was rescued but later confirmed dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Minoru Kihara said rescuers "spotted what are believed to be part of the aircraft in the sea, and we believe that the two helicopters crashed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this point the cause is unknown, but firstly we do our best to save lives," Kihara told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the helicopters were "doing drills to counter submarines at night".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours later, Kihara told reporters that the crew member who was rescued "was confirmed dead," according to the spokesman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the ministry retrieved flight recorders and was "analysing (the cause of the incident) including possibility of a collision between the two."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The helicopters appear to have crashed during night-time training off the Izu Islands in the Pacific Ocean, broadcaster NHK reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Communication with one chopper was lost at 10.38pm (1338 GMT) off the island of Torishima, and one minute later an emergency signal was received from this aircraft, NHK reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 25 minutes later, at around 11.04pm, the military realised that communication with the other aircraft was also lost in the same area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mitsubishi SH-60K helicopters from the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) are mainly based on and operate from naval destroyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MSDF said as there were no other aircraft nor vessels in nearby waters, involvement of another country in the incident is unlikely, NHK added. (AFP)

Fourteen dead in Israeli West Bank raid

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Palestinian Red Crescent said on Saturday at least 14 people had been killed in an Israeli raid on Nur Shams refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli army said troops had killed 10 militants during the operation, which it said started on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AFP journalists saw bodies in the streets and houses hit by blasts as Israeli drones flew overhead and armoured vehicles moved through the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since early last year, violence has flared in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. It has escalated further since war broke out in Gaza on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, our crews have evacuated 14 martyrs from Nur Shams camp to the hospital," the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Palestinian health ministry said it had confirmed 11 injured in the Israeli raid, seven of them "wounded by live gunshots". Among them was a paramedic shot while trying to get to the wounded, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medics had been alerted to "a number of killed and injured" inside the camp, but the army was "denying them access to tend to the wounded", the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An AFP journalist said paramedics had tried to enter the camp but had been refused access by the army. Gunshots rang out and soldiers carried out door-to-door raids, the journalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in Gaza, Palestinian emergency services said on Sunday that  they have uncovered a mass grave with 50 bodies at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The discovery comes after the Israeli military withdrew its troops from the southern city on April 7 - Much of the city is now in ruins after months of relentless Israeli bombardment and heavy fighting. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers in the US House of Representatives on Saturday quickly passed legislation to provide more aid to Ukraine and Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bills, passed in a rare Saturday session, were approved by overwhelming bipartisan votes, though they leave the future of House speaker Mike Johnson in doubt as he seeks to fend off angry far-right detractors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the long-delayed aid package, saying the military and economic assistance would "save thousands and thousands of lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bills are the product of months of acrimonious negotiations, pressure from US allies and repeated pleas for assistance from Zelensky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spending bills cost the last Republican speaker of the House his job, and funding for Ukraine has been at the heart of the partisan squabbling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has been the chief military backer of Ukraine in its war against Russia, but Congress has not approved large-scale funding for its ally for nearly a year and a half, mainly because of the cross-aisle bickering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers in Congress have been pushing for a major new weapons package for Ukraine for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Republicans, influenced by the party's presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been reluctant to provide funding to Kyiv for the drawn-out conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financing of the war has become a point of contention ahead of a presidential election in November that is expected to pit Biden against Trump once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson, after months of hesitation, finally threw his support behind the US$61 billion package for Ukraine that includes economic assistance and weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To put it bluntly, I'd rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys," Johnson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on social media after the bill was passed, Ukraine's Zelensky expressed hope that the bill would soon clear the US Senate and be signed into law by Biden. "Thank you, America!" he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill also allows Biden to confiscate and sell Russian assets and provide the money to Ukraine to finance reconstruction, a move that has been embraced by other G7 nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The upper chamber could take the bill up as early as Tuesday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. (AFP)

    S Korean doctors reject govt proposal to end strike

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's leading doctors' body on Saturday rejected a revised medical reform plan from the government, the initial version of which sparked a strike two months ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing walkout by thousands of trainee doctors has caused chaos in South Korean hospitals, and is in response to a plan to boost annual admissions to medical schools by 2,000 from next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Friday offered its first concession, allowing 32 universities to admit as few as 1,000 medical students instead of the initially proposed 2,000 – but the Korean Medical Association (KMA) said the plan must be abandoned entirely within a week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since this is not a fundamental solution, the emergency committee of the Korean Medical Association clearly states that it cannot accept it," Kim Sung-geun, a KMA spokesperson, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the sake of our country's future and to protect the health of patients currently suffering, we ask the president... to discuss this again from square one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim said "one week is left" to find a solution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government claims its plan will alleviate doctor shortages for an ageing society, but medical professionals and trainees say it will diminish the quality of education and healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strike, which began on February 20, has forced hospitals to cancel essential treatments and surgeries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of the trainee doctors, who play a key role in emergency procedures and surgeries at general hospitals, more than 50 percent of the country's medical students have also filed for a leave of absence, according to the education ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The KMA warned that if the government does not relent, medical students will likely be forced to repeat a year, senior doctors at general hospitals will start to resign on April 25, and the healthcare system could "collapse."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government's Friday offer came after President Yoon Suk-yeol's conservative ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initially, there was public sympathy for the government, but polls leading up to the April 10 election indicated that the mood had shifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 60 percent of people surveyed in a Dong-A Ilbo poll said the government should adjust the scale and timing of its reform plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main opposition Democratic Party has also criticised Yoon and urged him to revise the reform plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had previously warned of legal consequences if doctors did not return to work, and suspended the medical licences of two KMA officials purportedly for instigating the walkout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Proponents of the plan say opposing doctors are simply trying to safeguard their salaries and social status. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 58 people going to a funeral died after their overloaded boat capsized in the Central African Republic's capital Bangui, the head of civil protection said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We were able to extract 58 lifeless bodies. We don't know the total number of people who are underwater," Thomas Djimasse told Radio Guira.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to witnesses and videos on social media, the boat was carrying more than 300 people – some standing and others perched on wooden structures – when it overturned on the Mpoko river on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel was heading to the funeral of a village chief but capsized shortly after setting off, with rescuers arriving 40 minutes after the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maurice Kapenya, who followed the boat in a canoe because there was no space on board, said he collected the bodies of some of the victims, including his own sister, with the help of fishermen and residents.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Thousands rally in Tenerife demanding a change to the unlimited expansion of tourism. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749791_1_L_20240421004150.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of demonstrators hit the streets across Spain's Canary Islands on Saturday to demand changes to the model of mass tourism they say is overwhelming the Atlantic archipelago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rallying under the slogan "The Canary Islands have a limit", demonstrators began rallying at midday (1100 GMT), flag-waving crowds packing the streets of the main towns across all of the archipelago's seven islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chanting and whistling, they waved scores of placards and banners emblazoned with slogans reading: "The Canary Islands are not up for sale!" or "A moratorium on tourism" while others simply said: "Respect my home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers say mass tourism perpetuates an economic model that harms local residents and are demanding the authorities limit the numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said 20,000 demonstrators had turned out for the demonstrations, but organisers put the figure closer to 50,000, Spain's public television said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not against tourism," one woman demonstrator called Rosario Correo told Spain's TVE public television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're asking that they change this model that allows for unlimited growth of tourism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are calling for a halt to the work on two new hotels on Tenerife, the largest and most developed of the archipelago's seven islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And they also want residents to be given a greater say in what they see as uncontrolled development which is harming the environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government and the islands' regional leaders must stop this corrupt model of never-ending growth which is based on the destruction of the environment and which only weakens the economy," said another demonstrator called Alfonso Boullon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters also gathered in Madrid and Barcelona to show their support for the rallies in the Canary Islands, public television said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-tourism protests have multiplied in recent months across Spain, the world's second-most visited country, prompting authorities to try to reconcile the interests of locals and a lucrative sector that accounts for 12.8 percent of Spain's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The islands, which lie off the northwestern coast of Africa, are known for their volcanic landscapes and year-round sunshine attracting millions of visitors every year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some four out of 10 residents work in tourism which accounts for 36 percent of the islands' GDP, official figures show. (AFP)

    Israeli strike kills 9 members of family in Rafah

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday an overnight Israeli strike killed nine members of a Palestinian family including six children in the southern city of Rafah.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Five children aged one to seven and a 16-year-old girl were among the dead, along with two women and a man, according to the city's Al Najjar hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nine martyrs including six children were pulled out from the rubble after Israeli air forces struck a house of the Radwan family in Tal al-Sultan in Rafah," Gaza Civil Defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside the hospital witnesses saw people grieving over small body bags. A woman stroked a dead boy's forehead as planes rumbled overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People were sleeping peacefully," said neighbour Abu Mohammed Ziyadah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As you can see, there were no militants, not even male adults, except for the head of the family. They were all women and children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon after the war in Gaza began on October 7, Israel told Palestinians living in the north of Gaza to move to "safe zones" in the territory's south such as Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since vowed to invade the city, where around 1.5 million people – more than half the territory's population – are sheltering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has for two months threatened to send troops in against Hamas militants, but even without such an operation Rafah is under regular bombardment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bassal said the Israeli army struck several areas in Rafah overnight, including the Salam neighbourhood where one person was killed and several wounded. He said the army hit a house and a nursery school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a very hard night on Rafah," he said. (AFP)

    Taylor Swift, 'tortured poet', new album breaks record

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spotify said Taylor Swift became the most-streamed artist in a single day following her new album debut. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749722_1_L_20240420085534.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taylor Swift's hotly anticipated "The Tortured Poets Department" is here along with a surprise second album - 31 tracks released on Friday in which the megastar purges her inner turmoil while scorching former lovers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first album was released as scheduled at midnight (0400 GMT) but two hours later, an additional 15 tracks appeared - giving legions of Swifties plenty to chew on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Friday evening, platform Spotify declared the album its most-streamed in a single day, with Swift also becoming the most-streamed artist in a single day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here's the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn't mine anymore... it's all yours," she posted on social media in revealing the extra music.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's album comes on the heels of a remarkably successful and busy year for the artist, whose "Midnights" won her a record-setting fourth Album of the Year Grammy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She put on the first tour to break the $1 billion mark and is on track to make a second billion by the time it's over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift also released two re-recordings of her earlier albums to resounding success, and broke box office records with an Eras Tour film.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she also ended a six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn, after which she was linked to - and dramatically de-linked from - front man Matty Healy of the 1975.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now she's dating NFL star Travis Kelce, whose Kansas City Chiefs just won the Super Bowl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And all of the drama is immortalized in song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When she announced "TTPD," Swift said it would be "an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This period of the author's life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up." (AFP)
