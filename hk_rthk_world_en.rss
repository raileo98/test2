<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigel Farage, leader of Britain's anti-immigration Reform UK party, faced strong criticism Saturday after saying that the West provoked Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with a British media outlet on Friday, Farage said "we've provoked this war", while adding that "of course" it was Russian president Vladimir Putin's "fault".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters that Farage's claim was "completely wrong and only plays into Putin's hands".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour leader Keir Starmer, who looks set to take Sunak's job after an election next month, said Farage's comments were "disgraceful".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anyone who is standing for parliament ought to be really clear that Russia is the aggressor", he told reporters on the campaign trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage -- a former European Union parliamentarian who has tried and failed to run for Westminster seven times -- is seeking a seat for Clacton in east England in the country's general election next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His party is polling third behind the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour parties, but is only predicted to pick up a few seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, a surge of popularity for Reform UK since Farage took over as leader this month risks drawing away votes that the Conservative party sorely needs to win a fifth term in power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments met with outrage on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister James Cleverly criticised Farage for "echoing Putin's vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Conservative defence minister Tobias Ellwood called the comments "shocking" in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, adding that "Churchill will be turning in his grave".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Labour's defence spokesman John Healey called the comments "disgraceful" and said his stance made him "unfit for any political office in our country".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Probed further on his views on Putin in the interview, Farage said that he "disliked him as a person" but "admired him as a political operator because he's managed to take control of running Russia".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Brexit figurehead, Farage is close to former US President Donald Trump, who has said he gets along with Putin "great".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage has also spoken about his intention to run for prime minister in 2029.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stood by claims that Sunak, the first UK prime minister of colour, does not "understand our culture", in response to Sunak leaving D-Day commemorations in France early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He clarified in the interview that he meant Sunak was "too upper class".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage's comments on Sunak -- first made in a political leaders debate -- also drew criticism, with one Tory minister saying they made him "very uncomfortable". (AFP)

    Nasa again postpones return of Boeing Starliner
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nasa did not set a new date, raising questions about the timing of the return. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758566_1_20240622104348.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa has further postponed the Boeing Starliner's return to Earth from the International Space Station with its first crew of astronauts, to allow more time for review of technical issues encountered, the agency said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It did not set a new date, raising questions about the timing of the return of the two astronauts on Boeing's first crewed mission, which had initially been set for June 26, itself a pushback from the first potential date of June 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mission managers are evaluating future return opportunities following the station’s two planned spacewalks on June 24 and July 2," Nasa said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, lifted off on June 5 as a final demonstration to obtain routine flight certification from Nasa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process," said Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew programme manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station," Stich said, adding that the additional time would yield "valuable insight" into system upgrades for future missions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crewed test of the spacecraft, test-flown to space two times since 2019 without humans on board, has encountered five failures of its 28 manoeuvring thrusters, five leaks of helium gas meant to pressurise those thrusters, and a slow-moving propellant valve that signalled unfixed past issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issues and the additional tests run by Nasa and Boeing call into question when exactly Starliner's crew will be able to make the roughly six-hour return journey home, and add to the programme's broader problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has spent US$1.5 billion in cost overruns beyond its US$4.5-billion Nasa development contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa wants Starliner to become a second US spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts with the ISS, alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, its primary ride since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Boeing's Starliner programme has battled software glitches, design problems and subcontractor disputes for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Starliner arrived in the space station's vicinity to dock on June 6, the five thruster failures prevented a close approach by the spacecraft until Boeing made a fix.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It rewrote software and tweaked some procedures to revive four of them and proceed with a docking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner's undocking and return to Earth represent the spacecraft's most complicated phases of its test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa officials have said they want to better understand the cause of the thruster failures, valve issue and helium leaks before Starliner begins its return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While just one thruster remains dead in Starliner's current flight, Boeing encountered four thruster problems during the capsule's uncrewed return from space in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flight rules set by Boeing and Nasa require Starliner's manoeuvring thrusters to allow for "six degrees of freedom of control," at a minimum, and each have one backup thruster, a Nasa spokesperson told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That could mean at least 12 of the 28 thrusters, most of them backups, are required for a safe flight. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A shooter opened fire at an Arkansas supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers, Arkansas State Police said. The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police, Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 112 km south of Little Rock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody," Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident," she said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union countries on Friday formally approved the launch of accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova next week, another step in the two nations' long journey to join the 27-nation bloc.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Belgium, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, said member states have agreed on a negotiating framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This opens the way for launching the negotiations on Tuesday 25 June in Luxembourg,” the Belgian presidency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a positive assessment from the bloc’s executive branch, EU leaders had already agreed last year that accession negotiations should start with both countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The process between the start of negotiations with Ukraine and its neighbour Moldova and their becoming EU member states could take many years. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Armenia has officially recognised a Palestinian state, the Armenian foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday, the latest country to do so despite opposition from Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's foreign ministry said it summoned Armenia's ambassador to Israel after the former Soviet republic declared its recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following Armenia's recognition of a Palestinian state, the foreign ministry summoned the Armenian ambassador in Israel for a severe reprimand," it said in a statement shortly after Armenia's announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenia supports a United Nations resolution on an immediate ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and is in favour of a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the same statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, welcomed Armenia’s decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This recognition contributes positively to preserving the two-state solution, which faces systematic challenges, and promotes security, peace, and stability for all parties involved," the Authority's presidency said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain, Ireland and Norway were among several Western countries to officially recognise a Palestinian state, prompting Israel to pull its ambassadors from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo last month. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s military on Friday said it had fired warnings shots the previous day to repel North Korean soldiers who temporarily crossed the demarcation line between the two countries for the third time this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers while engaging in unspecified construction work on the northern side of the border briefly intruded the military demarcation line that bisects the countries at around 11am on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean military in response broadcast a warning and fired warning shots, to which the North Korean soldiers retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint chiefs didn't immediately release more details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s military has said it believes the previous two border intrusions this month weren’t intentional as the North Korean soldiers retreated after the warning shots and the North did not return fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South’s military said it had been observing increased North Korean construction activity in front-line border areas since April, such as installing suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforcing roads and planting land mines. (AP)

    UK's Sunak angered over election gambling probes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beleaguered Rishi Sunak faced questions over the gambling scandal on a BBC programme. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758374_1_20240621052318.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Thursday he was "incredibly angry" after more Conservative Party figures were put under investigation over alleged bets placed on the UK general election date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Facing questions on the growing scandal from an audience of voters on live television, the beleaguered leader said any election candidates or officials found to have broken rules would be kicked out of the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came hours after the Conservatives' campaign director stepped aside following reports that he and his wife, a Tory candidate in the July 4 election, were under investigation by betting regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, another would-be MP, Craig Williams, who was a Sunak ministerial aide, was also being probed for staking £100 (US$127) on the date before it was called.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London police said on Wednesday that one of the prime minister's police security detail had been arrested for allegedly placing a bet on the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was incredibly angry... to learn of these allegations," Sunak said of the cases involving his party officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Conservatives confirmed earlier that campaign director Tony Lee had started "a leave of absence" and that the Gambling Commission was looking into "a number of individuals".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regulator did not name individuals but the BBC reported that Lee and his election candidate wife Laura Saunders were under investigation. Her lawyers said she would "be co-operating with the Gambling Commission" and claimed the report infringed her privacy rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission had already said it was looking at the claims regarding Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Political bets are allowed in the UK, including on the date of elections, but using insider knowledge to do so is against the law. (AFP)

    Deadly heatwaves on four continents as summer begins

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deadly heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again help to fuel record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Record temperatures in recent days are suspected to have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths across Asia and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius, according to reports from foreign authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Countries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40C this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of the US Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.

  India's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat. But New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C at 1am. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Sutherland, one of Canada's most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in films such as "M*A*S*H," "Klute," "Ordinary People" and the "Hunger Games" films, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Canadian actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tall actor with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and mischievous smile managed to switch effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads, opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These included a rascally Army surgeon in "M*A*S*H" (1970), a quirky tank commander in "Kelly's Heroes" (1970), a small-town detective in "Klute" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in "Animal House" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1978) and a despairing father in "Ordinary People" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in "The Hunger Games" (2012) and its sequels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life," Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia was thinking about possible changes to its doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The existing doctrine states that Russia may use such weapons in response to a nuclear attack or in the event of a conventional attack that poses an existential threat to the state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the war in Ukraine, some hawks among Russian military analysts have been advocating that Russia should lower its threshold for nuclear use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said, however, that there was no need for Russia to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was speaking to reporters a day after visiting nuclear-armed North Korea for a summit with its leader, Kim Jong Un. The two leaders signed a treaty under which each side promised to provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed aggression against either one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian state media quoted Putin as saying that Moscow expected that its cooperation with North Korea would serve as a deterrent to the West, but that there was no need to use North Korean soldiers in the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also said he did not rule out Russia supplying high-precision weapons to North Korea. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian President Klaus Iohannis withdrew from the race to lead Nato on Thursday, clearing the way for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to become the next secretary-general of the transatlantic military alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All other Nato members had already backed Rutte, a staunch ally of Ukraine and outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to take over from Jens Stoltenberg, who is stepping down this year after a decade in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the war in Ukraine on Nato's doorstep and European nations concerned about the possible return of Nato-critical Donald Trump to the White House, alliance members concluded the highly experienced Rutte was the best person for the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As it announced Iohannis's decision, Romania's supreme defence council said it would donate one of the country's two operational Patriot systems to Ukraine, responding to pleas from Kyiv to its allies for more air defence assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Romania's decision "will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme council, which is chaired by Iohannis, said the president had informed Nato last week of his decision to withdraw and Romania would now support Rutte's candidacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With all 32 Nato members now backing the Dutchman, diplomats said they expected the alliance's governing North Atlantic Council to formally select him for the post in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia, while guarding against any escalation that could draw Nato directly into a war with Moscow. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a series of deals with his Vietnamese counterpart To Lam during a state visit that comes as Moscow sought to bolster ties in Asia to offset growing international isolation over its military actions in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two signed agreements to further cooperation on education, science and technology, energy, climate change and health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Strengthening a comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam is always one of our priorities,” said Putin, according to Russian news agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin had arrived at Vietnam’s Presidential Palace on Thursday afternoon, where he was greeted by school children waving Russian and Vietnamese flags. There he shook hands with and embraced Vietnam’s new President To Lam before a bilateral meeting and a joint briefing to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin had arrived in Hanoi early Thursday morning from North Korea, where he and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed an agreement that pledged mutual aid in the event of war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strategic pact could mark the strongest connection between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War and comes as both face escalating standoffs with the West. (AP)

    Hundreds of Hajj pilgrims feared dead amid heatwave

<div class="itemFullText">
 Diplomats from Arab nations on Thursday said hundreds of people had died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced intense high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat during the pilgrimage, required of every able Muslim once in their life, nor offered any causes for those who died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports were conflicting, but unofficial accounts suggested that at least 500 people had died during the Hajj pilgrimage, with some saying the death toll was likely higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over two million people travel to Saudi Arabia. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage’s history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the high temperatures and intense heat made things especially treacherous for pilgrims this year, with temperatures hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday. (Agencies)

    Louisiana makes Ten Commandments compulsory in classes

File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758221_1_20240620063458.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry on Wednesday signed into law a bill that makes the state the only one in the country to require displaying the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American Civil Liberties Union immediately announced it would sue to block the law, saying it violates the constitutional separation of church and state and a US Supreme Court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landry signed the bill along with a package of others he said were designed to "expand faith in public schools."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law-giver, which was Moses," Landry said at the signing ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Christian and Jewish faiths, God revealed the Ten Commandments to Hebrew prophet Moses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other measures would authorise the hiring of chaplains in schools, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender pupil's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landry also signed bills that would expand tutoring for underperforming students, help improve maths skills, and impose fewer curriculum mandates on teachers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil rights group ACLU and its Louisiana chapter along with Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced they would file a lawsuit to challenge the law that requires a specific text of the Ten Commandments be prominently displayed in all classrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other state has such a law, the groups said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools," the statement said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Vietnam early on Thursday for talks with the country's leaders on the final stop of his two-nation tour of Asia after concluding a defence pact with North Korea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin's aircraft touched down at Hanoi's airport, where he was met on a red carpet by Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha and top Communist Party diplomat Le Hoai Trung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an opinion piece timed for his visit, Putin applauded the Southeast Asian Communist-ruled country for supporting "a pragmatic way to solve the crisis" in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam, which officially pursues a neutral foreign policy, has abstained from condemning Russia's attack on Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as praising Vietnam for its "balanced" stance on the Ukraine war, Putin listed progress on payments, energy and trade between the countries in the article published in Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian country is the third nation Putin has visited, after China and North Korea, since he was sworn in for a fifth term in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam has been gearing up for a full state welcome for Putin, his first visit since 2017 and his fifth in total.
  <br/>

    Nowhere in Israel safe if war erupts: Hezbollah chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and he also threatened Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterannean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza War. On Tuesday, the group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said "there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones" in Israel in the event of a broader war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also had "a bank of targets" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel "knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big...In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea," Nasrallah added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war," Nasrallah said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from authorities in Cyprus. (Reuters)

    Rohingya refugees among dead in Bangladesh landslides

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10 people, including eight Rohingya Muslims, were killed and several others injured on Wednesday after heavy monsoon rains triggered landslides in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People died in landslides at four separate places in the early hours of Wednesday, Mohammad Shamsud Douza, a senior Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said after days of heavy rain as the monsoon season began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said children and women are among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 1 million Rohingya live in crowded camps in the border district of Cox's Bazar, the world's largest refugee settlement, after fleeing a military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bangladesh weather office said it expected heavy rains to continue for the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rohingya refugees mostly live in shacks made of bamboo and plastic sheets, often on steep, bare hills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are facing a terrible situation in the camps due to the rain, even the narrow paths are so slippery and dangerous," Rohingya refugee Mohammed Kamal said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain and the onrush of upstream water from India also left hundreds of thousands of people marooned in the northeastern region of Bangladesh, still recovering from a cyclone that hit the country's coastal belt in the southern part late last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 500,000 people have been affected by the flood in the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj, with water levels surpassing danger levels at six points along four rivers in the region, officials said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environmental protesters sprayed paint on Britain's Stonehenge on Wednesday, with orange marks covering some of the stones of the prehistoric megalithic structure on the eve of the summer solstice celebrations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two people have been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument, police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is extremely upsetting and our curators are investigating the extent of the damage," English Heritage, the charity that manages Stonehenge, said on X. Stonehenge remains open, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monument, one of Britain's most visited tourist spots, also holds spiritual significance and attracts thousands of revellers, spiritualists and tourists during the summer solstice – the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In video released by environmental group Just Stop Oil, two protesters were seen running towards two of Stonehenge's megaliths and spraying paint as another person attempted to stop them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public were able to walk around within the stone circle, located in southern England, until 1977 when it was fenced off due to concerns over damage from a sharp rise in the number of visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just Stop Oil are a disgrace," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on X of the protest at the Unesco World Heritage Site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just Stop Oil has gained prominence in Britain for disruptive environmental protests, with its activists shutting down major roads, disrupting cultural and sporting events and even throwing soup at a Van Gogh painting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group wants the British government to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in on Wednesday for a second term in which his African National Congress (ANC) will share power with other parties after it lost its majority for the first time in 30 years of democracy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A former liberation movement, the ANC came to power under Nelson Mandela's leadership in the 1994 elections that marked the end of apartheid and had long been unbeatable, but it lost its shine after presiding over years of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a parliamentary election on May 29 in which no party won a majority, Ramaphosa will head a government of national unity with five other parties, including the ANC's largest rival, the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While investors have welcomed the inclusion of the DA, which wants to boost growth through structural reforms and prudent fiscal policies, analysts said sharp ideological divisions between the parties could make the government unstable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just before the election, Ramaphosa signed into law a National Health Insurance bill that the DA said could collapse the country's health system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear what would happen to that law under the new government. (AP)

    Russia says open to prisoner swap with the US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Evan Gershkovich will go on trial behind closed door on charges of espionage next week, but Russia has hinted at a possible prisoner swap for the Wall Street Journal reporter. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758132_1_20240619154436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Wednesday said it was waiting for the United States to respond to its proposals for a prisoner swap, a week before reporter Evan Gershkovich was set to face trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The ball is in the court of the United States, we are waiting for them to respond to the ideas that were presented to them," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russia's state media in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich, a US citizen and a journalist with the Wall Street Journal, has been behind bars since his March 2023 arrest and faces 20 years in prison if convicted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial is to be held in the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, where he was arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich has since been held in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, about 1,400 kilometres to the west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the trial would be closed to the public, as is usual in espionage cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich is accused of “gathering secret information” on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General’s office said last week in the first details of the accusations against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he believes a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That appeared to be Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that Moscow and Pyongyang would sign an agreement that would bolster their ties, and thanked North Korea for supporting the Kremlin's policies in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the start of his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Russian leader said in remarks carried by Russian state media that the “new fundamental document will form the basis of our ties for a long perspective.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also hailed a “close friendship” between the two countries based on “equality and respect of mutual interests,” and noted their “fight against the imperialist hegemonistic policies of the US and its satellites against the Russian Federation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin expressed his hope that the next meeting between the pair would "take place in Moscow" in an apparent invitation to the North Korean leader to visit the Russian capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian president and Kim later signed a partnership that included a vow of mutual aid if either country is attacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear what kind of assistance the deal, described as a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” would call for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin’s first visit to North Korea in 24 years comes amid growing concerns over an arms arrangement in which the country provides Moscow with essential munitions for the war in Ukraine in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile programme.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="David Calhoun stood and turned to apologise to relatives of the crashes face-to-face. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758044_1_20240619042133.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's CEO acknowledged to a US congressional panel on Tuesday that the company's culture was imperfect, but insisted the aviation giant was making progress and committed to improving safety.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Our culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress," David Calhoun said early in the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun opened his remarks by standing to apologise to family members of victims from two Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing, an examination of "Boeing's Broken Safety Culture," follows an April session of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations featuring a Boeing engineer who testified that he was punished for raising safety questions about the top-selling 787 Dreamliner and 777.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun's appearance marks his first testimony before a congressional panel since an alarming mid-flight incident in January on a 737 Max plunged the company back into crisis mode. US investigators are still probing the incident with the Alaska Airlines plane, which made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday morning, the Senate committee detailed additional complaints from Boeing workers, including an official filing from a whistleblower who worried that Boeing's lax policies on the use of damaged or inadequate parts could "lead to a catastrophic event," according to a subcommittee memo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing stands "at a moment of reckoning and an opportunity to change a broken safety culture," said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who is chairing the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The session comes ahead of a Department of Justice determination on next steps after concluding in May that the company could be prosecuted for violating a criminal settlement following two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, off Indonesia and in Ethiopia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blumenthal said there "is near overwhelming evidence... that prosecution should be pursued."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a federal court of its plans by July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the April 17 hearing, witnesses painted a disturbing picture of a company that dismissed safety questions and sidelined critics as it chased faster production and bigger profits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star witness was engineer Sam Salehpour, who went public with allegations that, because of flawed manufacturing processes, the Dreamliner could suffer a potentially catastrophic accident because of excessively large gaps in the plane's assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has pointed to extensive testing that it says proves the 787 is safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun emphasised that he welcomes when workers speak out about problems, viewing such expressions as a critical component of safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pledged to get back to the committee on questions about workers who may have been fired for expressing concerns about safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun also said he would provide details on instances on how the company responds to workers who engage in retaliation against workers who speak out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In connection with the probe, Blumenthal and Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, sent a letter to Calhoun seeking records that would shed light on Salehpour's allegations about the 787 and 777, as well as records relating to Boeing's whistleblower policies and protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same two senators also sent a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker related to the allegations, as well as other ongoing Boeing-related matters, such as a six-week FAA audit of the company following the Alaska Airlines incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate panel on Tuesday released details on additional workers who have come forward with problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes a new whistleblower, Sam Mohawk, who said that Boeing ordered improperly stored parts to be hidden from federal aviation inspectors, who would have demanded Boeing increase storage capacity and hire additional staff, raising costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing was attended by a small group of family members who lost relatives in the 2018 and 2019 Max crashes, which together claimed 346 lives. The group held signs with their loved ones at the outset of the session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also held a press conference just ahead of the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun is a "mass killer," said Adnaan Stumo, brother to Nadia Milleron, who died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. "There needs to be criminal charges for the people at the top. The people in the driver's seat were responsible for 346 deaths, including my sister." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday morning for his first visit in 24 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit – at the invitation of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un – underscores Moscow's growing relationship with the nuclear-armed state since Russia began its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin was greeted by North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un at a welcoming ceremony at an airport in Pyongyang and the pair embraced and shook hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian leader issued a presidential order on the eve of the visit, saying Moscow was looking to sign a "comprehensive strategic partnership treaty" with North Korea, which his foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said would include security cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ushakov said the deal would not be directed against any other country, but would "outline prospects for further cooperation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will include one-on-one discussions between the two leaders, as well as a gala concert, state reception, honour guards, document signings, and a statement to the media, Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Putin's aide Ushakov as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow has said Putin will next travel to Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western countries, South Korea and Kyiv have accused Pyongyang of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, in violation of UN sanctions on North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington and Seoul say Russia has in return provided Pyongyang with technical help for its satellite programme and sent aid to the food-strapped state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has scaled down trips abroad since launching the Ukraine offensive, but has paid some high-profile visits to Moscow's key allies such as China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang rarely hosts foreign guests, isolated diplomatically and having shut itself off even more since the Covid pandemic. (Reuters/AFP)

    Black hole observed 'awakening' for the first time

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This artist’s impression shows the growing disc of material being pulled in by the black hole as it feeds on the gas available, making the galaxy light up. Image: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758034_1_20240619021538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Astronomers have been able to observe a supermassive black hole waking up and setting the heart of its host galaxy alight for the first time, the European Southern Observatory said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The galaxy 300 million light years from Earth in the Virgo constellation had been quiet for decades until late 2019, when it suddenly began to shine brighter than ever before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre of the galaxy – where a supermassive black hole is believed to be squatting – since then has been radiating a variety of rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This behaviour is unprecedented," Paula Sanchez Saez, an European Southern Observatory astronomer and first author of a new study in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "most tangible option" to explain this brightening is that the astronomers were watching "the activation of a massive black hole in real time," study co-author Lorena Hernandez Garcia said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most galaxies – including our own Milky Way – are believed to have a supermassive black hole at their centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These cosmic behemoths are by definition invisible – not even light can escape the pull of their awesome power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only way to observe black holes is when they destroy something huge that lets off light in its death throes: such as a star that wandered too close being torn apart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These giant monsters usually are sleeping," study co-author Claudio Ricci explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for the galaxy SDSS1335+0728, "we were able to observe the awakening of the massive black hole, (which) suddenly started to feast on gas available in its surroundings, becoming very bright," the astrophysicist added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial observations indicate the black hole has 1.5 million times more mass than the Sun, enough for it to be classified as a supermassive black hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is still on the lighter side, as the true heavyweights easily exceed a billion times the Sun's mass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The international team of astronomers is analysing data from a number of telescopes hoping to determine whether the black hole's activity is temporary – perhaps caused by a star being ripped apart – or whether it will continue to be active for a long time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is something that could happen also to our own Sgr A*," the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, Hernandez Garcia said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fortunately for us, our own black hole remains fast asleep. (AFP)

 Justin Timberlake was arrested early on Tuesday on allegations that the singer was driving while intoxicated on New York’s Long Island, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Timberlake was released from custody later in the morning after being arraigned in Sag Harbor, on the eastern end of Long Island. He was charged with one DWI count, with his next court date scheduled for July 26, the Suffolk County district attorney’s office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake’s lawyer and representatives did not immediately return requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sag Harbor is a coastal village in the Hamptons, around 160 kilometres from New York City. In the summer, it is a hot spot for wealthy visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A young Timberlake was a Disney Mouseketeer, where his castmates included future girlfriend Britney Spears. He rose to fame in the boy band NSYNC and embarked on a solo recording career in 2002. As an actor, Timberlake has won acclaim in movies including "The Social Network” and “Friends With Benefits.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has won 10 Grammy awards and four Primetime Emmy Awards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, Timberlake was in the headlines when Spears released her memoir, “The Woman in Me.” Several chapters were devoted to their relationship, including deeply personal details about a pregnancy, abortion and painful breakup. In March, he released his first new album in six years, the nostalgic “Everything I Thought It Was,” a return to his familiar future funk sound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake has two upcoming shows in Chicago on Friday and Saturday, then is scheduled for New York's Madison Square Garden next week on Tuesday and Wednesday. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli intelligence brief prepared weeks before Hamas's October 7 attack had warned military officials of the Palestinian group's preparations for an assault, according to Israeli public broadcaster Kan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military's signals intelligence unit drafted the brief in September, less than a month before the Hamas attack that sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, Kan reported on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the Unit 8200 intelligence document included details of elite Hamas fighters training for hostage-taking and plans for raids on military positions and Israeli communities in southern Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brief said the Palestinian militants were aiming to take hundreds of hostages, Kan reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The expected number of hostages: 200-250 people", the brief said according to Kan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unprecedented Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 251 people hostage, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 41 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive since October 7 has killed at least 37,372 people in the Gaza Strip, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Kan, citing unnamed security officials, the brief was known to intelligence officials in the military's Gaza Division and Southern Command.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli politicians have rebuffed calls for a thorough investigation into intelligence failures surrounding the Hamas attack, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted any official probe should wait until after the war, now in its ninth month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military however said it was "investigating the events" of October 7, with a probe being "actively carried out" that would later be made public. (AFP)

    'La Dolce Vita', '8 1/2' star Anouk Aimee dies at 92

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Anouk Aimee received the honorary Golden Bear award in 2003 for her lifetime achievement. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758023_1_20240618221507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anouk Aimee, the French actress whose movies included Federico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita", Jacques Demy's "Lola" and Claude Lelouch's "A Man and a Woman", has died aged 92.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We bid farewell to a world-famous icon, to a great actress of French cinema who took on roles for some of the biggest names, such as Demy, Lelouch and Fellini," said French Culture Minister Rachida Dati on social media platform X on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aimee's daughter Manuela Papatakis said in an Instagram post that Aimee had passed away at home in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her role as a lovelorn widow in "A Man and a Woman" (1966) famous for its "chabadabada, chabadabada" theme tune won her an Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe for best actress and her entry into Hollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aimee's elegant sophistication had already made her a star of such European masterpieces as Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" (1960) and "8 1/2" (1963), and she was unforgettable as the ageing showgirl in Jacques Demy's heartbreaking musical "Lola" (1961).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellini in particular revered her, saying her "face has the same intriguing sensuality as that of (Greta) Garbo, (Marlene) Dietrich or (Cindy) Crawford, these great mysterious queens, these priestesses of femininity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anouk Aimee represents the kind of woman who worries you to death," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That combination of "melancholy and passion" marked much of her remarkable career, with the American director Robert Altman bringing her out of retirement to rekindle her old spark with Marcello Mastroianni in the acclaimed "Pret a Porter" in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born Francoise Dreyfus in Paris on April 27, 1932, Aimee was the scion of a theatrical family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her life was turned upside down when German troops marched into the city when she was eight. Her father was Jewish, putting the family in mortal danger, even though she was raised a Catholic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We moved all the time. We hid... But then the Germans turned up and took over the apartment downstairs," she recalled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family sent her to the countryside where they hoped she would be safer, changing her name so she would not have to wear a yellow star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her lifelong love of animals was born from the comfort they gave her during her time in hiding, she later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war over, her career began at the age of 13 when she was picked from the street to play in a Marcel Carne film that was never finished for lack of money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She finally made her screen debut the following year and adopted her character's name, Anouk, as her own. It would become popular in France thanks to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was French poet and screenwriter Jacques Prevert who convinced her to also change her surname to Aimee, meaning "loved".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her career took off in 1949 with Andre Cayatte's "The Lovers of Verona". Her class and beauty brought her a string of roles including in "Montparnasse 19" by Jacques Becker before she began to work with Demy and Fellini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2002 she was awarded an honorary Cesar – France's Oscars – and Cannes paid tribute to her four years later. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to approve a marriage equality bill, clearing the last legislative hurdle for the country to become the first in Southeast Asia to enact such a law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bill passed its final reading with the approval of 130 of the 152 members of the Senate in attendance, with four voting against it and 18 abstaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill now needs the pro forma endorsement of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, followed by its publication in the Government Gazette, which would set a date within 120 days when it becomes effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand will become the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The marriage equality bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through the House of Representatives right before the previous parliamentary session concluded in April. (AP)

    Former Thai PM Thaksin indicted for insulting monarchy

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757931_1_20240618133645.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai prosecutors on Tuesday formally indicted influential former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra under the kingdom's strict royal insult laws over comments he made nearly a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, a powerful backer of the ruling government, was granted bail and avoided pre-trial detention for allegedly insulting the monarchy in a 2015 interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The billionaire sought bail from the Criminal Court of Thailand soon after the Attorney-General had formally charged him under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which carries a maximum jail sentence of up to 15 years for each perceived royal insult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin denies the charges against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The court has released Thaksin on bail of 500,000 baht under the condition that he is prohibited from leaving the country unless granted permission," a court statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former policeman who went into the telecoms business and then entered politics, Thaksin returned to Thailand last year after 15 years in self-imposed exile following his ouster from power by a military coup in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin's was the first of four high-profile cases involving key political players that were before the courts on Tuesday, in the latest legal wrangling that could see Southeast Asia's second-largest economy plunged into a new period of uncertainty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cases involve some of Thailand's most powerful politicians, including its current prime minister, and could deepen a decades-old rift between the conservative-royalist establishment and its opponents, such as the populist ruling Pheu Thai party and the opposition Move Forward party.

 Several North Korean soldiers working near the heavily fortified border with the South were wounded in a landmine explosion, the Yonhap News Agency said Tuesday, citing Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "North Korean military suffered multiple casualties due to a mine explosion during work," it said, without giving further details. The border between the two countries is heavily mined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's military said the explosions came after dozens of North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the border but retreated after Seoul's military fired warning shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the second such incursion in two weeks. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed in India on Monday when a goods train driver missed a signal and slammed into an express passenger train from behind, police and railway officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three passenger carriages were derailed and flipped on their side, while one carriage was thrust high into the air, precariously balanced on another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident in West Bengal state is the latest to hit India's creaking rail network, which carries millions of passengers each day – and the most recent reported failure of drivers missing basic signals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 people were injured and taken to hospital, Jaya Varma Sinha, chairman of India's Railway Board said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A goods train disregarded the signal and hit the train from behind," Sinha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dead included the driver and co-driver, who missed the signal, as well as a train guard and five passengers, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinha said the casualties could have been worse, but a guard wagon and two others carrying post that were attached to the back of the passenger train took the brunt of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were two parcel carriages attached... which protected other carriages from extensive damage," she said, but added that the guard wagon "was badly damaged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash took place in the Phansidewa area of Darjeeling district, when the Kanchenjunga Express train was hit by the goods train.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to "those who lost their loved ones," in a post on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called the crash "tragic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments after the collision, she said that "ambulances and disaster teams" were rushed to the site, giving orders for "action on a war footing" to be initiated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local police officer Iftikar-Ul-Hassan said he saw several badly injured people pulled out of the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The toll could rise further, as four people are admitted in a serious condition," he said, adding that rescue teams were working to return the line to service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tracks are being cleared and restored for operations," he added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='French football star Kylian Mbappe says he is "against extremes and divisive ideas." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757857_1_20240618012819.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's sports minister, Amelie Oudea-Castera, on Monday hailed as exemplary a statement by football superstar Kylian Mbappe urging voters not to back extremes in snap elections called by President Emmanuel Macron to combat the far right.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mbappe, representing France at the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, said he was "against extremes and divisive ideas" and urged young people to vote at a "crucial moment" in French history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments from Mbappe, 25, one of the icons of modern France, have sparked a stream of controversy, with figures on the right warning him against interfering in politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kylian spoke in an absolutely exemplary manner yesterday (Sunday). He wanted to speak to young people at a totally unprecedented and decisive moment for the future," of the country, said Oudea-Castera.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's men's football team has long been seen as a beacon for diversity in the country. The French Football Federation has urged against "any form of pressure and political use of the French team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope I will still be proud to wear this shirt after July 7," said Mbappe, referring to the second round of the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The striker defended comments made on Saturday by his teammate Marcus Thuram, saying he "had not gone too far" in calling on the country "to fight every day to stop" the RN winning the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we can all see that extremists are very close to winning power and we have the opportunity to choose the future of our country," Mbappe said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, several dozen French sports personalities including tennis player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and athlete Marie-Jose Perec also called for a vote against the far right, in an op-ed for L'Equipe sports daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see that our athletes want to make their voices heard," added Oudea-Castera, herself a former professional tennis player, as she attended rehearsals for the Olympics opening ceremony on the River Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an attitude that is courageous, committed, and that can be applauded, that is deeply respectable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former French football star Thierry Henry, now coach of the French Olympic team, also added his voice, urging voters to "block the extremes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there is something that is still important, what can block the extremes is to go and vote. So go and vote," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personally, I am against anything that divides and a little more for anything that can unite," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN) may win the largest number of votes in the election but may struggle to form an overall majority. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech police said on Monday that an Indian citizen suspected of involvement in an alleged plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States had been extradited there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Justice Department charged the man, identified as Nikhil Gupta, in November with plotting to assassinate a Sikh separatist leader on US soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It alleged an Indian government official was also involved in planning the plot to kill the person, a US citizen of Indian origin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Sikhs support the Khalistan movement, that wants an independent homeland in the northern Indian province of Punjab, which Indian authorities strongly oppose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has cracked down on the movement while denying involvement in the targeting of pro-Khalistan activists outside India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The foreigner suspected in the United States of an assassination plot has been in the hands of the US judiciary since Friday," Czech police said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that Gupta was "safely extradited from a Prague airport," posting video images of the man being escorted into a plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gupta was detained at Prague airport on June 30, 2023, under extradition orders issued by the US Justice Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said the man allegedly targeted in the killing "is a vocal critic of the Indian government and leads a US-based organisation that advocates for the secession of Punjab."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was elected to a third term this month, had vowed to "look into" the case while visiting the United States in late 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's foreign ministry has said it created a "high-level" inquiry committee to investigate the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, The Washington Post reported in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A similar case in Canada has meanwhile sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada arrested and charged four Indian nationals in May over their alleged role in the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a separatist Sikh leader, in Vancouver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, had advocated for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wanted by Indian authorities for alleged "terrorism" and conspiracy to commit murder – allegations he denied – Nijjar was shot and killed on June 18, 2023, outside the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had "credible allegations" connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India dismissed the allegations as "absurd" and responded by briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to North Korea on Tuesday for a "friendly" visit, the Kremlin announced, as the West suspects Pyongyang of supplying Moscow with weapons for its Ukraine offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit to the world's most reclusive state comes as Putin seeks ammunition to continue his military campaign launched in February 2022, which has thrown Moscow into unprecedented global isolation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also comes nine months after Putin hosted North Korea's Kim Jong Un on a rare foreign trip to the Russian Far East, where the pair lavished each other with praise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Vladimir Putin on June 18-19 will go to the North Korean Democratic Republic on a friendly state visit," the Kremlin said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow said Putin will then travel to Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western countries, South Korea and Kyiv have accused Pyongyang of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, in violation of UN sanctions on North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington and Seoul say Russia has in return provided Pyongyang with technical help for its satellite programme and sent aid to the food-strapped state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has scaled down trips abroad since launching the Ukraine offensive, but has paid some high-profile visits to Moscow's few key allies such as China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang rarely hosts foreign guests, isolated diplomatically and having shut itself off even more since the Covid pandemic. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his country's six-member war cabinet, in a widely expected move that came after the departure from government of the centrist former general Benny Gantz.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was now expected to hold consultations about the Gaza war with a small group of ministers, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer who had been in the war cabinet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister had faced demands from the nationalist-religious partners in his coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to be included in the war cabinet, a move which would have intensified strains with international partners including the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forum was formed after Gantz joined Netanyahu in a national unity government at the start of the Gaza war in October and also included Gantz's partner Gadi Eisenkot and Aryeh Deri, head of the religious party Shas, as observers. (Reuters)

    S Africa's Zuma vows to fight 'rigged' elections

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jacob Zuma, right, a stern expression on his face, sat quietly as his speech was read out. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757709_1_20240617044538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South African former president Jacob Zuma said on Sunday his new party would join an opposition alliance to coordinate resistance to the government, while maintaining its challenge to the general election results.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The 2024 elections were rigged" the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party spokesman Nhlamulo Ndhlela said, reading out a statement on behalf of the 82-year-old ex-leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have instructed our legal team to take any steps possible both inside of South Africa and internationally to ensure that justice is done."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he added: "At the right time we will call on our people to demonstrate their dissatisfaction against all these injustices peacefully, in the streets, in the court and even in parliament until our grievances are addressed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MK also said it would join a newly formed parliamentary grouping that includes several mostly leftist opposition parties represented in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Called the "Progressive Caucus" it is currently led by the radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which won 39 seats in the new parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuma, a stern expression on his face, sat quietly as his speech was read out, occasionally answering questions from the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MK came third in the election, winning 14.6 percent of the vote and 58 parliamentary seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the party boycotted the country's first parliamentary sitting where Zuma's long-term political foe Cyril Ramaphosa was re-elected as president for a second term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party announced it had launched a fresh court bid to dispute the "rigged" election results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had already gone to court to try to prevent the new parliament from convening, and lodged a separate complaint over alleged election irregularities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other parties have also complained to the country's electoral body and lodged legal complaints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa, who will be inaugurated on June 19, will lead what he calls a government of national unity after the May poll produced no outright winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national unity government includes the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and other smaller groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal got a frosty reception from the opposition parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndhlela for the MK denounced the new coalition as a "white-led unholy alliance" that "must be crushed before it finds its feet." He accused the ANC of going to "bed with the racists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EFF dismissed the idea of working with rivals holding radically different political views, such as the DA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuma has been a bitter rival of Ramaphosa's ever since he was ousted by his own party, the African National Congress (ANC), under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018 and replaced by Rampaphosa. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer who tried to intercept a fleeing cow by hitting it with a vehicle in England has been removed from duty, police said in a statement on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The incident occurred on Friday evening after police were called to a sighting of a cow in a residential area of the small town of Staines-upon-Thames in southern England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surrey Police on Sunday said that the officer driving the car had been "removed from frontline duties pending the outcome of these investigations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Constable Nev Kemp of Surrey Police said: "I fully appreciate the distress our handling of this incident has caused and will ensure that it is thoroughly and diligently investigated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images published on social media and in the British press showed a police car hitting the animal twice. The cow ended up with its head and upper body trapped under the police car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can think of no reasonable need for this action. I've asked for a full, urgent explanation for this. It appears to be unnecessarily heavy handed," Home Secretary James Cleverly wrote on X, formally Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, police said that after several unsuccessful attempts to recover the cow and taking public safety into account, a decision was made to intercept the cow using the police vehicle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 10-month-old cow, christened "Beau Lucy," was examined by a vet and reunited with its owner who said the animal was "doing better." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 German police shot and injured a man after he threatened passers-by and officers with a pickaxe and a Molotov cocktail ahead of a Euro 2024 match in Hamburg on Sunday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "At around midday on Sunday (1000 GMT), a man threatened several passers-by and police officers with a pickaxe and a Molotov cocktail," police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police then shot and injured the attacker, who "may have been having a psychiatric crisis," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamburg was thronging with football fans at the time ahead of the Euro 2024 match between Poland and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, police said there was no indication of a link to the Euro 2024 clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man came out of a snack bar holding the weapons and approached passers-by and police at the scene "in a threatening manner," the police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he did not comply with a request to put them down, police shot at him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesman said he was shot in the leg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was treated by first-aiders at the scene and then taken to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect has been identified as a 39-year-old German man, the police said, adding that his motive was not known.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said earlier on X, formerly Twitter, that the incident had triggered a "major operation" in the city's St Pauli district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It happened near the Reeperbahn station, more than a kilometre away from the city's official football fan zone. (AFP)

    Israel announces daily Gaza 'pause' for aid deliveries

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gazans hold Eid al-Adha prayers by the ruins of the Al-Rahma mosque. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757699_1_20240617002227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military said on Sunday it would "pause" fighting around a south Gaza route daily to facilitate aid deliveries, following months of warnings of famine in the besieged Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement of a "local, tactical pause of military activity" during daylight hours in an area of Rafah came a day after eight Israeli soldiers were killed in a blast near the far-southern city and three more troops died elsewhere, in one of the heaviest losses for the army in its war against Hamas militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations welcomed the Israeli move, although "this has yet to translate into more aid reaching people in need," said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, calling for "further concrete measures" on aid needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Gazans "urgently need food, water, sanitation, shelter, and healthcare, with many living near piles of solid waste, heightening health risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be able to deliver aid safely throughout Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN agencies and aid groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm of dire shortages of food and other essentials in the Gaza Strip, exacerbated by overland access restrictions and the closure of the key Rafah crossing with Egypt since Israeli forces seized the Palestinian side in early May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has long defended its efforts to let aid into Gaza including via its Kerem Shalom border near Rafah, blaming militants for looting supplies and humanitarian workers for failing to distribute them to civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes will take place from 8.00am (0500 GMT) until 7.00pm (1600 GMT) every day until further notice along the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the Salah al-Din road and then northwards," a military statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A map released by the army showed the declared humanitarian route extending until Rafah's European Hospital, about 10 kilometres from Kerem Shalom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came as Muslims worldwide mark Eid al-Adha, but there is little to celebrate in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no joy. We have been robbed of it," said Malakiya Salman, a 57-year-old displaced woman, now living in a tent in Khan Younis city in the southern Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gazans, like Muslims the world over, would usually slaughter sheep for the holiday – whose Arabic name means "feast of the sacrifice" – and share the meat with the needy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents would also gift children new clothes and money in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses in Gaza's north and centre reported no fighting on Sunday morning, though there was some shelling and at least one strike in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military stressed in a statement there was "no cessation of hostilities in the southern Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the pause was already in effect and part of efforts to "increase the volumes of humanitarian aid" following discussions with the UN and other organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, which has been pressing close ally Israel as well as Hamas to accept a ceasefire plan laid out by President Joe Biden, on Friday imposed sanctions on an extremist Israeli group for blocking and attacking Gaza-bound aid convoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the eight soldiers killed on Saturday were hit by an explosion as they were travelling in an armoured vehicle near Rafah, where troops were engaged in fierce street battles against Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the blast was "apparently from an explosive device planted in the area or from the firing of an anti-tank missile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, two soldiers were killed in fighting in northern Gaza and another succumbed to wounds inflicted in recent fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's losses brought the Israeli military's overall toll to 309 deaths since it began its its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his condolences following "this terrible loss" and said that "despite the heavy and unsettling price, we must cling to the goals of the war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas following the Palestinian group's unprecedented October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,337 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of countries said on Sunday that Ukraine's "territorial integrity" should be respected in any peace deal to end the war, as they said "dialogue between all parties" would be necessary for a lasting settlement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a final communique issued at the end of a major two-day diplomatic summit in Switzerland, the vast majority of countries also backed a call for the full exchange of captured soldiers and return of deported Ukrainian children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not all attendees backed the document, with India, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates among those not included in a list of supporting states displayed on screens at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that reaching peace requires the involvement of and dialogue between all parties," the document stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "We reaffirm our commitment to ... the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognised borders."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 countries had gathered in the Swiss resort of Burgenstock for the summit, dedicated to discussing Kyiv's proposals for a route out of the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow was not invited and has rejected the summit as "absurd" and pointless.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv had worked hard to secure attendance from countries that maintain warm relations with Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final document also called for all prisoners of war to be released in a "complete exchange" and for all Ukrainian children who had been "deported and unlawfully displaced" to be returned to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv accuses Russia of abducting almost 20,000 children from parts of the east and south of the country that its forces took control of.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Working groups at the summit also addressed the issues of global food security and nuclear safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Food security must not be weaponised in any way," the declaration stated, adding that access to ports in the Black and Azov Seas was "critical" for global food supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the countries also called for Ukraine to have "full sovereign control" over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located in the south of Ukraine, the facility is Europe's largest nuclear energy site and has been controlled by Russian forces since early in the war. (AFP)

    At least 19 hajj pilgrims dead in Saudi Arabia

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 Jordanian and Iranian pilgrims have died while on the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, authorities from their countries said on Sunday, as temperatures soar in the kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "14 Jordanian pilgrims died and 17 others were missing" during the performance of hajj rituals, Jordan's foreign ministry said in a statement, not specifying their cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Koolivand said "five Iranian pilgrims have lost their lives so far in Mecca and Medina during the hajj this year," also not saying how they died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hajj, one of the world's biggest religious gatherings, is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must perform it at least once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures have pushed well past 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) during the annual pilgrimage that around 1.8 million Muslims are taking part in this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of the rituals are performed outdoors and on foot, creating challenges especially among the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not provided any information on fatalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the kingdom has implemented heat mitigation measures, including climate-controlled areas, distributes water, and offers advice to pilgrims on protecting themselves from the sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During last year's hajj at least 240 people – many from Indonesia – died, according to figures announced by various countries which also did not specify causes of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 10,000 heat-related illnesses were recorded last year, 10 percent of them heat stroke, a Saudi official said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Saudi study said regional temperatures were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade, and worsening heat may be outpacing mitigation measures. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A shooter has opened fire at a water park in the US state of Michigan, wounding nine or more people including at least one child, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The local sheriff's office said it potentially had the suspect contained near the scene of the shooting in Rochester Hills, a suburb of Detroit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It appears like the individual pulled up, exited a vehicle, approached the splash pad, opened fire. Reloaded, opened fire. Reloaded. Left. So it appears very random at this point," Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County told reporters, adding he believed the shooter had "no connectivity to the victims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said preliminary information indicated there were nine to 10 victims of varying ages, including one eight-year-old child. Several hospitals have received patients, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Glock handgun and empty magazines were recovered at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Bouchard, "we believe we have an individual who's a suspect contained nearby."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that assets including SWAT teams and armoured vehicles have been deployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she was "heartbroken" to learn of the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials," she said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun violence in the United States is common, and thousands of Americans are killed each year in shootings. Efforts at broad reforms to the nation's gun laws have been stymied for decades. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 250,000 people took to the streets across France on Saturday to protest the rise of the far right after their success in European polls prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call legislative elections, police said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Paris, police estimated 75,000 people had responded to a call from unions, associations and a new left-wing political coalition formed for the parliamentary elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CGT union put the figure at 640,000 protesters at a total of 182 rallies including 250,000 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Bayonne in the southwest to Nice in the southeast, from Vannes in the west to Reims in the east, demonstrators mobilised against the prospect of a victory for the far right in the legislative elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If that were to happen, National Rally (RN) party leader Jordan Bardella could become prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I would never see the far right come to power and now it could happen," said Florence David, 60, who took part in the Paris protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No need to vote RN to love France," was among the slogans used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The marches took place mostly in calm, apart from a few brief episodes of tension in Rennes and Nantes in western France where a few dozen hard-left activists were pushed back by the police with tear gas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Paris, street infrastructure was damaged and a bank branch was targeted by hooded protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police there were also the target of bottles thrown to which they responded with tear gas. (AFP)

    Israel army says eight soldiers killed in Gaza

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said eight soldiers were killed in Gaza on Saturday when the armoured vehicle they were in exploded, in one of the deadliest blows for the army since the war began in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Captain Wassem Mahmud, 23, and seven other soldiers "fell during operational activity in southern Gaza," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their families have been notified."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked if the soldiers died when the Namer armoured vehicle they were travelling in exploded, a military press desk officer said: "Yes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer said the explosion struck near Gaza's far-southern city of Rafah, where troops are engaged in fierce street battles with Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's losses were among the heaviest for the military since it began its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-one soldiers were killed on January 22 when rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire hit a tank near two buildings where they were carrying out an operation, the military said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buildings exploded as troops had planted explosives in them after the structures had been identified as "terrorist infrastructure" in the area, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's deaths take to 306 the military's losses since October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,296 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Ukraine summit seeking peace plan opens in Switzerland

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling the summit the first step towards a just peace. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757607_1_20240615232721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders were joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Switzerland on Saturday for a summit on peace in his country, but with Russia staying away it is seen as the first step in a long process.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Swiss hosts have sought to temper expectations at the two-day gathering, with an agenda laying the groundwork for a path to peace – with future summits envisioned, eventually involving Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zelensky himself expressed high hopes for the outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see history being made here at the summit," he said on social media platform Telegram, as he greeted presidents and prime ministers arriving at the luxury Burgenstock resort high above Lake Lucerne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we are making the first step toward just peace based on the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law," he said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a combative speech on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the conference and demanded that Kyiv effectively surrender before any actual peace negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky branded Putin's demands a territorial "ultimatum" reminiscent of Nazi Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler, while Nato and the United States also immediately rejected the hardline conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conference, convening exactly 100 countries and global institutions, comes at a perilous moment for exhausted Ukrainians and outgunned soldiers, more than two years since Moscow launched its full-scale assault in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 50 heads of state and government figure among the attendees, including all of the G7 leaders who have been meeting in Italy – with one notable exception.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden instead sent his Vice President Kamala Harris, who announced more than US$1.5 billion in new aid for Ukraine, mainly for its energy sector and in humanitarian assistance as she arrived in a US Army helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan are attending, as is the European Union chief and the leaders of Colombia, Chile, Finland, Ghana, Kenya and Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentinian President Javier Milei and the presidents of Ecuador and Fiji were among the early arrivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Brics allies Brazil and South Africa are meanwhile only sending an envoy, and India will be represented at the ministerial level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is absent, insisting it will not take part without Moscow's presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost a year of stalemate, Ukraine was forced to abandon dozens of frontline settlements this spring, with Russian troops holding a significant advantage in manpower and resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near Ukraine's embattled eastern front, hopes for any major breakthrough are nearly nil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to hope that it will bring some changes in the future. But, as experience shows, nothing comes of it," said Maksym, a tank commander the Donetsk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Kyiv, Victoria, a 36-year-old energy industry worker, said she was "exhausted" by the war and wanted to believe the summit would help end it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, she said, "I'm a realist in life, so I don't have high hopes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts have also warned against unrealistic expectations from the gathering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meaningful negotiations that could truly end the devastating war in Ukraine remain out of reach, as both Kyiv and Moscow stick to theories of victory that amount to outlasting the other," the International Crisis Group think tank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit aims to find paths towards a lasting peace for Ukraine based on international law and the United Nations Charter; a possible framework to achieve this goal; and a roadmap as to how both parties could come together in a future peace process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A plenary session involving all delegations will be held on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, three topics will be discussed in detail in working groups: nuclear safety, freedom of navigation and food security, and humanitarian aspects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second summit is envisaged. Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Tuesday that Kyiv hoped Russia would attend and receive a "joint plan" presented by the other attendees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at the Rand think tank, said of the Burgenstock summit: "Russia is clearly going out of its way to demonstrate its pique with it... That tells you something.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Avoiding the expansion of the pro-Ukraine coalition – they're concerned about this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since mid-May, Russian military progress has slowed and Zelensky hopes to swing the momentum further with the back-to-back G7 and peace summits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky arrived at Burgenstock on Friday evening after the G7 summit agreed to offer a new US$50-billion loan for Ukraine, using profits from the interest on frozen Russian assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A landmark 10-year security deal signed by Zelensky and Biden on Thursday will see the United States provide Ukraine with military aid and training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, the European Union's 27 member states agreed "in principle" on beginning accession negotiations with Ukraine. (AFP)

 Ukrainian attacks on southern Russia's Belgorod region killed six people on Friday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia's Emergencies Ministry said four bodies had been pulled from the rubble of a multi-floor apartment building hit by Ukrainian shelling in the border town of Shebekino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A ministry statement posted after midnight said 50 percent of the rubble from the site had been cleared. Pictures on the ministry's Telegram channel showed a crane clearing debris and the building's facade shattered, with one stairwell collapsed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a Ukrainian drone had struck a car in a village near Shebekino, killing the driver. He said a woman was killed in her home when it was struck by rocket fire in the village of Oktyabrsky, further west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has staged frequent attacks on Belgorod and other Russian border regions in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Vladimir Putin cited attacks on Belgorod as grounds for a cross-border incursion last month into Ukraine's Kharkiv region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian military said its troops seized about a dozen settlements, while Ukrainian officials say the advance has been contained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the Ukrainian side of the border, military officials in Sumy region said a Russian air strike on Friday killed one person in the town of Shostka, about 45 km inside Ukrainian territory.

<div class="itemFullText">
 G7 leaders said the UN Palestinian refugee agency must be allowed to work unhindered in Gaza, in the draft of an end-of-summit statement seen by AFP on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We agree it is critical that UNRWA and other UN organisations and agencies' distribution networks be fully able to deliver aid to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandate effectively," the Group of Seven nations said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They called for all parties to facilitate "rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need" in Gaza, particularly women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Securing full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access in all its forms -- consistent with international humanitarian law, and through all relevant land crossing points, including the Rafah crossing, through maritime delivery routes, including through Ashdod Port -- and throughout all of Gaza remains an absolute priority," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UNRWA, which coordinates nearly all aid to Gaza, has been in crisis since January, when Israel accused about a dozen of its 13,000 Gaza employees of being involved in the October 7 attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That prompted many governments, including top donor the United States, to suspend funding to the agency, threatening its efforts to deliver aid in Gaza, although several have since resumed payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An independent review of UNRWA, led by French former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some "neutrality-related issues" but said Israel had yet to provide evidence for its main allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the draft statement, the G7 leaders repeated concern at the "unacceptable number of civilian casualties" in the Hamas-Israel war, now into its ninth month. They again endorse a truce and hostage release deal. (AFP)

 Pope Francis on Friday called for a ban on "lethal autonomous weapons", as he addressed the G7 leaders' summit in Italy on the perils of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In light of the tragedy that is armed conflict, it is urgent to reconsider the development and use of devices like the so-called 'lethal autonomous weapons' and ultimately ban their use," the pope said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis became the first pontiff to address the G7 group of industrialised nations as he called on countries and global bodies to push for stronger guardrails on AI given the boom in artificial intelligence and its applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leaders of the Group of Seven nations turned their attention to migration at the start of the second day of their summit Friday, seeking ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to AI, the gathering in a luxury resort in Italy’s southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, as well as China’s industrial policy and economic security. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New YouGov poll puts Reform UK ahead of the Conservatives leaving the Tories in danger of a general election wipe-out in July's general election.

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak warned on Friday that a vote for Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party would hand electoral victory to Labour, after a poll put the right-wing group ahead of Sunak's Conservatives for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Farage is one of Britain's most recognisable politicians best known for his decades long - and eventually successful - crusade for Britain to leave the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His Reform UK party began life as the Brexit Party in 2018, during the tortuous negotiations on how Britain would leave the bloc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage's unexpected return to frontline politics has split support among right-of-centre voters, badly damaging Sunak's hopes of winning an election he was already predicted to lose to the opposition Labour Party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That impact was shown in a YouGov poll on Thursday which put Reform UK on 19 percent, up from 17 percent previously, and the Conservative Party unchanged on 18 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour, led by Keir Starmer, topped the poll with 37 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this poll was replicated it would hand a blank cheque to Labour," Sunak said in Italy, where he is attending the G7 summit, according to remarks reported by British media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately a vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate makes it more likely that Keir Starmer is in No.10."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage said his party had made a "phenomenal" start to the campaign and was now the real opposition to Starmer's Labour. (Reuters)

    Tesla approves Musk's multi-billion dollar pay deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to restore CEO Elon Musk's record pay package. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757465_1_20240614175814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's US$56 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The favorable vote doesn’t necessarily mean that Musk will get the all-stock compensation anytime soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The package is likely to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court and Supreme Court for months as Tesla tries to overturn the Delaware judge's rejection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electric car maker's stock remains richly valued even after several years of weakness in shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shareholders at Tesla's annual general meeting on Thursday re-approved Musk's 2018 record-setting compensation that backers said was necessary to keep the billionaire focused on the car company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk had raised doubts about his future with Tesla this year, writing on X, the social media platform he owns, that he wanted a 25 percent stake in the company in order to stop him from taking his artificial intelligence development projects elsewhere. The higher stake was needed to control the use of AI, he has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla's stock rose nearly three percent on Thursday ahead of the meeting after Musk posted on X that he had won shareholder approval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even after Thursday's gains, Tesla's shares have tumbled 27 percent this year, and its market value has been more than halved to US$582 billion from its November 2021 high as Tesla faces fierce competition in China from BYD and other EV makers selling less-expensive cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla's shares received a badly needed boost after Musk said on April 23 that Tesla would release more affordable new models in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its quarterly revenue fell for the first time since 2020, when the pandemic hampered production and deliveries. (Agencies)

    Millions gather in Mecca for Hajj pilgrimage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Muslim worshippers pray around the Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757438_1_20240614154349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 1.5 million pilgrims from around the world have amassed in and around Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage in which the faithful circle the cube-shaped Kaaba in the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of pilgrims was still growing as more from inside Saudi Arabia joined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi authorities expected the number of pilgrims to exceed two million this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which pushed the entire Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran and its proxies on the other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinians in Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip’s southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian authorities said 4,200 pilgrims from the occupied West Bank arrived in Mecca for Hajj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi authorities said 1,000 more from the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the war in Gaza also arrived to perform Hajj at the invitation of King Salman of Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1,000 invitees were already outside Gaza — mostly in Egypt — before closure of the Rafah crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, involves a series of rituals in Mecca and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia that take several days to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the five pillars of Islam, it must be performed at least once by all Muslims who have the means to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After travelling from all parts of the globe to Islam's holiest city, the pilgrims will first perform the "tawaf" -- circling seven times around the Kaaba.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will then head towards Mina, a valley surrounded by craggy mountains several kilometres outside Mecca, where they will spend the night in air-conditioned tents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The climax will come on Saturday with day-long prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed delivered his final sermon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilgrims in white garments have already been circling the Kaaba in large numbers for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some have waited for years for the chance to make the trip, with permits allocated by Saudi authorities on a quota basis for each country. (Agencies)

    G7 leaders pledge support for Ukraine

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a 10-year security agreement on Thursday that they hailed as a milestone in relations between their countries, but that alone was not enough to stop Zelenskyy from wondering how much longer he could count on America's support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy also said his country “urgently” needed additional air defence systems to protect Ukrainians and the nation's infrastructure from Russia's continued bombardment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaders signed the agreement on the sidelines of the annual Group of Seven summit, and Biden said the goal "is to strengthen Ukraine's defence and deterrence capabilities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy said at a joint news conference that the signing made for a “truly historic day,” but he also wondered about the durability of support from the United States and other allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's president said the right question to ask is “for how long the unity in the world will remain?" and how it will be influenced by the outcome of elections this year in many of those countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the first day of their meeting in southern Italy, G7 nations agreed on a deal to provide US$50 billion of loans for Ukraine backed by interest from frozen Russian assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although many details still need to be worked out, G7 members and the European Union are expected to contribute to the loan, with cash to reach Kyiv by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very historic step we're taking today," said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. "It is also a clear signal to the Russian President (Vladimir Putin), that he can't just sit this out and hope that fiscal problems in a country that backs Ukraine will one day let him win this war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  G7 leaders are also expected to discuss China and immigration in their summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pope Francis is also putting in a historic appearance at the G7 meeting, discussing artificial intelligence and holding multiple bilateral meetings including with Biden, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a historic day. We will welcome the Holy Father. It is the first time for a pontiff at a G7. I am proud it will happen under the Italian presidency," Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told reporters on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests were staged near the summit venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators voiced support for Palestinians and accused the G7 of failing to do more in environmental protection. (AP/Reuters)

    Battles rage in Rafah, US says Gaza truce possible

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli helicopters struck Gaza's Rafah on Thursday, residents said, with Hamas reporting street battles in the southern city after top US diplomat Antony Blinken said a truce was still possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the war raged on, and tensions soared on Israel's northern border with more attacks by Lebanon's Hezbollah forces targeting military positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, which has traded near-daily fire with Hamas ally Hezbollah since the start of the Gaza war, said it would respond "with force".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli ground forces have been operating in Rafah since early May, despite widespread alarm over the fate of Palestinian civilians there, including in a ruling by the International Court of Justice later that month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western areas of Rafah came under heavy fire on Thursday from the air, sea and land, residents said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said its fighters were battling Israeli troops on the streets in the city, near the besieged Gaza Strip's border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Efforts to reach a truce stalled when Israel began ground operations in Rafah, but US President Joe Biden in late May launched a new effort to secure a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday the UN Security Council adopted a US-drafted resolution supporting the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken, in Doha on Wednesday to promote Biden's ceasefire roadmap, said Washington would work with regional partners to "close the deal".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said the group sought "a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal" of Israeli troops from Gaza, demands repeatedly rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan includes a six-week ceasefire, a hostage-prisoner exchange and Gaza reconstruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would be the first truce since a week-long November pause in fighting saw hostages freed and Palestinians released from Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said Israel was behind the plan, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government has far-right members strongly opposed to the deal, has not publicly endorsed it. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and New Zealand on Thursday signed agreements on trade and climate change during Premier Li Qiang's visit to the country, the highest level Chinese visit in seven years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li also expressed the hope that New Zealand can support Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership when he met Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on the first day of his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the talks, the Premier was greeted on the lawns of Government House in the capital Wellington by Luxon and participated in a traditional indigenous Maori welcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the meeting, Li said that the two agreed that it is important to expand cooperation on trade and investment and that China is ready to be part of New Zealand's efforts to double its value of exports in the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Premier said Beijing will also extend visa-free travel to New Zealanders, while New Zealand will support Chinese language teaching and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We agreed that it is important to promote the sustained sound and steady development of China and New Zealand relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to view and handle bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective to lay a solid political foundation of our cooperation in all fields.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said he expressed the hope that New Zealand could support the SAR in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade agreement. Hong Kong officially requested to join RCEP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luxon for his part said they discussed the two country's significant economic relationship, with two-way trade in goods worth nearly 22.4 billion US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and New Zealand have different political systems and as with all of our long standing relationships, it is natural that we will raise our differences with China consistently and predictably," Luxon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li will later visit Australia this weekend and then travel to Malaysia.

 A Russian navy frigate and a nuclear-powered submarine churned into Havana harbour on Wednesday, a stopover the US and Cuba said posed no threat but was seen as a Russian show of force.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cuba - a long-time ally of Russia - saluted the ships' arrival with cannon fire, while Russian diplomats waved Russian flags and took selfies as the vessels passed the harbour's historic fortresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Admiral Gorshkov frigate, and later the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, half submerged with its crew on deck, were accompanied by a tugboat and fuel ship that had arrived earlier in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four Russian vessels sailed to Cuba after conducting "high-precision missile weapons" training in the Atlantic Ocean, according to Russia's defence ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The submarine and frigate carry Zircon hypersonic missiles, Kalibr cruise missiles and Onyx anti-ship missiles, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cuba said last week that the visit was standard practice by naval vessels from countries friendly to Havana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cuban foreign ministry said the fleet carried no nuclear weapons, something echoed by US officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US said it had been monitoring the Russian vessels as they skirted the nearby Florida coast, but said they posed no threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday such naval exercises were routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen this kind of thing before and we expect to see this kind of thing again, and I'm not going to read into it any particular motives," Sullivan said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over audio recordings of a special counsel interview with Democratic President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure passed 216-207 on a party-line basis with one Republican joining Democrats in voting no.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice has already turned over a transcript of the interview, which set off a political firestorm in February when Special Counsel Robert Hur released a report describing Biden, 81, as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has asserted that the recordings are covered by executive privilege, and a vote by the House to hold Garland in contempt would put the Justice Department in the awkward position of having to decide whether to prosecute its own leader. It is not required to take up the charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garland is the third attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress, following Democratic President Barack Obama's attorney general Eric Holder and Republican President Donald Trump's Bill Barr. The Justice Department did not pursue charges in either case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Transcripts alone are not sufficient evidence of the state of the president's memory," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said as debate opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representative Jerrold Nadler, the senior Democrat on the panel, countered that Republicans were on a "single-minded quest to follow every right-wing conspiracy theory in the vain hope that it might lead to some evidence of wrongdoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hur, who had investigated Biden after classified documents dating to his time as vice president from 2009-2017 were found improperly stored in his home and office, declined to prosecute the president, saying it was both because he had cooperated with the probe and because he would present a sympathetic face to a jury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's rival in the November 5 election, Trump, has been criminally charged for mishandling classified documents after his 2017-2021 term in the White House, though unlike Biden, Trump refused requests to return the documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congressional Democrats have alleged that Republicans want the audio to use in campaign ads for Trump. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) will join a unity government with the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), it said on Wednesday, giving a strong indication of who will govern the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ANC, which lost its majority in a May 29 election but remains the largest party, has been talking to a broad spectrum of political parties to try to set up a government of national unity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final composition of the government has not yet been announced, but the comments by IFP leader Velenkosini Hlabisa gave the most precise picture of how negotiations are shaping up ahead of the newly elected parliament's first sitting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many ANC supporters strongly oppose a coalition with the pro-business DA, which is the largest opposition party but has struggled to shed its image as a defender of white privilege.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have speculated that including the IFP, a conservative party with an ethnic Zulu base, could help temper those concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will participate in the government of national unity for the sake of our country and for the sake of our people, who want life to continue with a stable government that will address their challenges," Hlabisa told reporters at a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spokespersons for the ANC and the DA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties have been rushing to reach agreement before Friday, when the National Assembly will meet to elect its speaker, deputy speaker and the country's president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Cyril Ramaphosa is highly likely to be reelected since the ANC has the highest number of seats, but key positions such as speaker of parliament and deputy president are the subject of behind-the-scenes negotiations. (Reuters)

    Macron urges centre to unite; Republicans ditch leader

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday urged rival parties to join his electoral alliance against Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, while the conservative Republicans ditched their party chief for seeking a far-right pact.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fast-moving political developments come after Macron's shock decision to call a snap parliamentary election in a few weeks' time. The vote could hand real power to Le Pen's party after years on the sidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what amounted to a campaign speech, Macron on Wednesday defended his decision to call the snap vote, and urged parties on both sides of the political centre to join him in the battle against the hard right in the June 30 and July 7 elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron, who ruled out quitting if his ruling alliance loses, called on "our compatriots and political leaders who do not recognise themselves in the extremist fever" to "build a new project ... a coalition to govern."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of the political chaos that Macron's decision has unleashed, the Republicans party leadership on Wednesday decided to kick out their party chief Eric Ciotti after he appealed for an electoral alliance between his party's candidates and the RN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron described such an accord as a "deal with the devil". It would have ended the decades-long mainstream political consensus to block the far-right from power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on X, Ciotti said the Republicans meeting had not followed protocol: "I am and remain the president of our political party, elected by the members!" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron called the election on Sunday after the anti-immigration, eurosceptic RN came out on top in a vote for the European Parliament. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that broke out in a building housing workers in the city of Mangaf in southern Kuwait early on Wednesday has killed at least 41 people, the country's deputy prime minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Saud Al-Sabah said during a visit to the site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deputy PM accused real estate owners of violations and greed, saying those factors contributed towards the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, the greed of real estate owners is what leads to these matters," said Sheikh Fahad, who also runs the interior and defense ministries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire was reported to authorities at 6am local time, Major General Eid Rashed Hamad said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The building in which the fire occurred was used to house workers, and there was a large number of workers there. Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire," another senior police commander told state TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always alert and warn against" cramming too many workers into housing accommodation, he said, without providing details on the workers' type of employment or place of origin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire was contained and authorities were investigating its cause, officials said. (Reuters)

    Hamas accepts UN-backed truce, wants more talks

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israeli armoured vehicles move through the Gaza Strip. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757013_1_20240612033549.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas accepts a UN resolution backing a plan to end the war with Israel in Gaza and is ready to negotiate details, a senior official of the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Qatari and Egyptian mediators said they had received a formal reply from Hamas to the UN-backed truce proposal, and Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad expressed "readiness to positively" reach a deal to end the war in Gaza in a joint statement on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However both Israel and Hamas have suggested the plan meets their clashing goals, raising doubts over whether any genuine headway towards a deal can be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hamas response reaffirmed the group's stance any agreement must end the Zionist aggression on our people, get the Israeli forces out, reconstruct Gaza and achieve a serious prisoners swap deal," a Hamas official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discussions also touching on post-war plans for Gaza will continue over the next couple of days, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Tel Aviv after talks with Israeli leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken met Israeli officials on Tuesday in a push to end the eight-month-old Israeli air and ground war against Hamas that has devastated Gaza, a day after President Joe Biden's proposal for a truce was approved by the UN Security Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian residents said Israeli forces operating in the southern city of Rafah blew up a cluster of homes on Tuesday and and an Israeli air strike in a main street in Gaza City killed four people, medics said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's proposal envisages a ceasefire and phased release of hostages in exchange for Palestinians jailed in Israel, ultimately leading to a permanent end to the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri, who is based outside Gaza, said it accepted the ceasefire resolution and was ready to negotiate over the specifics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This required a formula stipulating the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a swap of hostages held in Gaza for Palestinians jailed in Israel, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US administration is facing a real test to carry out its commitments in compelling the occupation to immediately end the war in an implementation of the UN Security Council resolution," Abu Zuhri said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said earlier the Hamas statement was "a hopeful sign" but definitive word was still needed from the Hamas leadership inside Israeli-besieged Gaza. (Reuters)
