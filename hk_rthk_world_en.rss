<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday likened Ukraine's incursion into Russia to the 2004 Beslan school massacre, in which some 330 people died in a hostage siege.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin visited the school for the first time in almost 20 years, paying tribute to the victims at memorials, including a cemetery and the site of the destroyed school, where Chechen militants took more than 1,000 people hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meeting mothers who lost children in the siege, Putin said that Russia's enemies are again trying to destabilise the country, referring to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just as we fought the terrorists, today we have to fight those who are carrying out crimes in the Kursk region," Putin said, referring to Ukraine's cross-border offensive that began two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But just as we achieved our goals in the fight with terrorism, we will achieve these goals also in this direction in the fight with neo-Nazis," Putin added, sitting opposite three women from the Mothers of Beslan group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And we will undoubtedly punish the criminals, there can be no doubt of that," Putin added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mothers of Beslan group has long called for an objective probe into the attack and the Russian authorities' response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The September 2004 siege lasted some 50 hours, ending in a gunfight when Russian special forces stormed the building following explosions in the school gym, where the hostages were being held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The siege in the Caucasus region of North Ossetia came amid a guerilla insurgency by Islamist Chechen separatists, branded "terrorists" by Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin launched a major Russian offensive to quash Chechnya's armed bid for independence in late 1999, weeks before becoming president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war against the Chechen insurgency helped fuel Putin's initial popularity, but at the end of 2019 he described the Beslan siege as a "personal pain" that would remain with him for life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin and the Kremlin were criticised for their handling of the attack at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the meeting with Putin, the Mothers of Beslan complained that Russia's investigation into the school siege has never been completed, the group's co-chairwoman Aneta Gadiyeva told the Agentstvo news outlet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This part of the meeting, unlike Putin's remarks about Ukraine, was not televised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gadiyeva said Putin told the women that he had not known this and would ask the head of the Investigative Committee to intervene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2017 that Russia's handling of the siege had "serious failings" in terms of preventing the attack and its use of excessive lethal force and called on Moscow to take measures to establish the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack came two years after Chechen fighters took hundreds hostage in a Moscow theatre, a stand-off which saw more than 130 killed – most by sleeping gas pumped into the theatre by Russian special forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Putin laid red roses at the foot of a monument in the cemetery, where he bowed down to "honour the memory of the victims of the terrorist attack," the Kremlin press service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also laid red roses at a monument to members of Russia's special forces who died during the storming of School Number One.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An "international cultural and patriotic centre for the prevention of terrorism" has been set up at the site of the former school, the Kremlin's press service said on Telegram. (AFP)

    Mpox 'not the new Covid', says WHO

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Democratic Republic of Congo Health minister Samuel-Roger Kamba announces a dramatic rise in cases in his country. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766951_1_20240820224627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The mpox outbreak is not another Covid-19, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday, because much is already known about the virus and the means to control it.
 <br>
  <br/>
  While more research is needed on the Clade 1b strain which triggered the UN agency into declaring an international health emergency, the spread of mpox can be reined in, the WHO's European director Hans Kluge said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mpox is not the new Covid," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know how to control mpox. And, in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether," he told a media briefing in Geneva, via video-link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July 2022, the WHO declared an emergency over the international outbreak of the less severe Clade 2b strain of mpox, which mostly affected men who have sex with men. The alarm was lifted in May 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We controlled mpox in Europe thanks to the direct engagement with the most affected communities," said Kluge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robust surveillance, investigating case contacts, behaviour changes in the affected communities and vaccination all contributed to controlling the outbreak, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kluge said the risk to the general population was low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Are we going to go in lockdown in the WHO European region, (as if) it's another Covid-19? The answer is clearly: 'no'," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1b is spreading mainly through sexual transmission among adults.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kluge said it was also possible that someone in the acute phase of mpox infection, especially with blisters in the mouth, may transmit the virus to close contacts by droplets, in circumstances such as in the home or in hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The modes of transmission are still a bit unclear. More research is required," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency was not recommending the use of masks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not recommending mass vaccination. We are recommending to use vaccines in outbreak settings for the groups who are most at risk," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO declared an international health emergency on August 14, concerned by the rise in cases of Clade 1b in the DR Congo and its spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two subtypes of mpox: the more virulent and deadlier Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1b is a new offshoot of Clade 1, which is now called Clade 1a.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clade 1b outbreak in northeastern DRC was first detected in September last year and is spreading rapidly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine Smallwood, WHO Europe's emergency operations programme area manager, explained that the split of Clade 1 into 1a and 1b reflects "change in the evolution of the virus."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clade 1a traditionally has outbreaks resulting from infections from sick animals, with some limited follow-on transmission between humans at the household level, or within communities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But with Clade 1B, "we have not isolated or detected zoonotic transmission of Clade 1b," said Smallwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it seems to be a strain of the virus that's circulating exclusively within the human population."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts are trying to work out if there is a difference in disease severity between Clades 1a and 1b.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The available vaccines were originally developed for smallpox, and are effective against other viruses in the wider orthopoxvirus family, such as mpox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two mpox vaccines have been used in recent years – MVA-BN, produced by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, and Japan's LC16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also ACAM2000, a second-generation smallpox jab approved in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether a person vaccinated post-exposure to mpox goes on to develop the disease depends on the early administration of the vaccine, said Smallwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vaccines can also be used preventatively in people likely to be exposed to the virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jasarevic said results from effectiveness studies indicated that a good level of protection was provided against mpox following vaccination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it takes several weeks to develop immunity after being vaccinated. (AFP)

    Blinken builds case for Gaza ceasefire

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives from Israel at El-Alamein in Egypt on the next leg of his Mideast trip to secure a truce in Gaza. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766883_2_20240820165113.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Egypt on Tuesday for talks on a Gaza ceasefire as he pushes Hamas to accept a deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday, will afterwards head to Qatar, which along with Egypt is brokering negotiations for a truce in the 10-month Gaza conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His departure from Tel Aviv came as an Israeli kibbutz community announced the death in captivity in Gaza of 79-year-old hostage Avraham Munder, underlining the urgency of a truce and hostage release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kibbutz Nir Oz said Munder had endured "physical and mental torture for months" and called his death "murder". There was no immediate comment from his captors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat flew to El Alamein, the Mediterranean city famous for a World War II battle in 1942, to speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at his summer palace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will then head to meet Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, in Doha, the scene of ceasefire talks last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the Doha negotiations, the United States presented proposals to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas and seal the May 31 ceasefire blueprint laid out by US President Joe Biden, who has faced growing domestic criticism over the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said on Monday that Israel had accepted the US proposal and that he would speak to Egypt and Qatar to gauge the reaction of Hamas, which has no direct relationship with the United States as it considers the militants a terrorist group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is, I think, a real sense of urgency here, across the region, on the need to get this over the finish line and to do it as soon as possible," Blinken said on Monday in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States is deeply committed to getting this job done, to getting it done now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also said the ceasefire proposal could be the "last chance" for a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He played down a public rejection by Hamas of the modifications in the latest proposal and said Israel was ready to send a delegation to new talks later this week, which the United States previously said would take place in Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A series of reports suggested that Israel has raised new conditions in recent talks, including insisting on control of the Gaza border with Egypt that Israel seized from Hamas. (AFP)

    Joe Biden swansong kicks off DNC in Chicago

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden blows a kiss to the crowd during the first day of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766876_1_20240820124919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An emotional Joe Biden won a huge ovation as he gave a farewell speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday, after Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance to thank him for being an "incredible" US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I love you," the tearful 81-year-old told the crowd to deafening cheers, less than a month after dropping out of the White House race against Donald Trump and passing the torch to his vice president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden took to the stage to chants of "We love you Joe" from the same party which had pushed him out over concerns about his age, in one of the biggest political shocks in US political history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We both know we have more to do, but we're moving in the right direction," he said, referring to himself and the 59-year-old Harris, who, in the space of a few breathtaking weeks, has turned the presidential race upside down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president has injected new life into the Democratic Party and wiped out Republican rival Donald Trump's lead in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She heaped lavish tribute on Biden, even breaking with tradition to speak on the first night of the convention in praise of her boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president Joe Biden," said Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are forever grateful to you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he has been so often in his five-decade-long political journey, Biden was surrounded by family, with wife Jill Biden and their daughter Ashley introducing him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Joe and I have been together for almost 50 years. And still, there are moments when I fall in love with him all over again," the first lady said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democrats are in an exuberant mood in Chicago, daring to hope for victory in November that seemed inconceivable just weeks ago after Biden's disastrous debate against Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Monday's first night of the convention was an emotional one on many levels, and for many of the key players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hillary Clinton, who lost against Trump in 2016 in her own bid to become America's first woman president, backed Harris to finally break the glass ceiling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Something is happening in America, you can feel it -- something we've worked for and dreamed of for a long time," the former secretary of state and first lady said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris will formally accept the party's nomination on the final day Thursday, in her biggest chance yet to define her candidacy in front of a huge audience of tens of millions of American voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her star turn will cap a week where the biggest names from the party's past will endorse her as its future, with former president Barack Obama speaking on Tuesday, and ex-president Bill Clinton introducing Harris's running mate Tim Walz on Wednesday. (Agencies)

    US blames Iran for Trump campaign hack

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US security agencies on Monday said Iran was behind a recent hack targeting Donald Trump's presidential campaign, accusing Tehran of seeking to influence the 2024 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed the Trump campaign claim from earlier in August that it had been targeted, potentially by Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns," the security agencies said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This includes the recently reported activities to compromise former president Trump's campaign, which the [intelligence community] attributes to Iran," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Iran's mission to the United Nations denied the country's role in the hack and challenged Washington to release evidence for the claim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such allegations are unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing," the mission said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we have previously announced, the Islamic Republic of Iran harbours neither the intention nor the motive to interfere with the US presidential election. Should the US government genuinely believe in the validity of its claims, it should furnish us with the pertinent evidence -- if any -- to which we will respond accordingly," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States goes to the polls on November 5, with both Trump's and Democratic rival Kamala Harris's campaigns saying they had been targeted by cyber attacks in recent weeks. (AFP)

 Former US Representative George Santos pleaded guilty on Monday to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with the federal fraud case that led to his expulsion from Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The New York Republican entered the plea in a courtroom in Long Island just weeks before his trial was set to begin in early September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was indicted on felony charges that he stole from political donors, used campaign contributions to pay for personal expenses, lied to Congress about his wealth and collected unemployment benefits while actually working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Santos was expelled from the US House after an ethics investigation found “overwhelming evidence” that he had broken the law and exploited his public position for his own profit. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has shared doctored images on social media showing Taylor Swift and her fans support his presidential campaign, in an apparent effort to tap into the pop singer's mega star power in the US election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swift has not yet publicly thrown her weight behind any presidential candidate in the November 5 election, but she backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and has previously been critical of Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Trump shared screenshots of posts with manipulated images – including some that an expert said appeared to be AI-generated – suggesting that the pop star and her fans, popularly known as Swifties, support his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his Truth Social post, which includes a poster of Swift clad in an Uncle Sam outfit and instructing her fans to vote for Trump, the former president wrote: "I accept!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That poster is either "AI generated or just classically manipulated," said Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The post also includes photos of women wearing shirts with the slogan "Swifties for Trump," some of which Farid said had the "tell-tale signs of being AI generated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What makes the mash-up "particularly devious" is that is a combination of real and fake imagery, with at least one photo of a woman wearing such a shirt looking legitimate, Farid said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from Swift about the post by Trump, who separately shared on Truth Social a video of a supporter voicing the dubious claim that "Swifties were rallying for Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's soaring popularity and sway over her fans could make her support valuable in the upcoming presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Republicans and Democrats have long wanted to count on her support, but the megastar has been largely reticent about her political leanings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a demonstration of her star power, when Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote last fall, directing them to the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org, her plea had an immediate impact.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following her message, the institution said it recorded more than 35,000 new registrations, 23 percent more than last year and the most since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's feelers into politics have been heavily scrutinised, making her a ripe target for political misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her reserve led many critics to speculate Swift was a closet Republican, until 2018, when she broke both her silence and the internet by endorsing the Democratic opponent of far-right US Senator Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since spoken out in particular for the legal right to an abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent weeks, intense speculation has swirled on social media that Swift will endorse Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The megastar has not commented publicly, but that has not stopped legions of fans to form a group called "Swifties for Kamala," attracting tens of thousands of followers on platforms such as Instagram and X, formerly Twitter. (AFP)

    City of Pokrovsk evacuated as Kremlin rules out talks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday ruled out entering peace talks with Ukraine over Kyiv's surprise offensive into Russian territory, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said was meeting its goals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine sent troops over the border on August 6 and has since held onto a part of the western Kursk region, in the biggest attack on Russian soil since Moscow attacked in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move has rattled Moscow and taken Ukraine's Western allies by surprise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has said the offensive is aimed at stretching Russian forces, creating a "buffer zone" and bringing the conflict "closer" to an end on "fair" terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said on Monday that it had pushed the prospect of peace talks further away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the current stage, given this escapade, we will not talk."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called entering a negotiating process "completely inappropriate" and said future talks "depend on the situation on the battlefield, including in the Kursk region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow, intent on not letting the offensive affect its own advance in eastern Ukraine, claimed another village in the war-battered Donetsk region on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bracing for a further assault, Ukraine ordered the evacuation of families from the key city of Pokrovsk as Moscow's forces inched closer to the logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, meanwhile, said his troops in Kursk – who have set up administrative offices and published previously unthinkable footage of Ukrainian soldiers patrolling Russian streets – are meeting their targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are achieving our goals. This morning we have another replenishment of the (prisoner of war) exchange fund for our country," Zelensky said, referring to more Russian troops being taken prisoner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Zelensky said the push into Russian territory was designed to create a "buffer zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prospect of peace talks appeared distant even before Ukraine launched its incursion into Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin had demanded Ukraine cede swathes of territory if it wanted a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky, who has ruled out direct talks with the Kremlin, demands Russia's full withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, and reparations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, Ukraine has destroyed two key bridges over the Seym river inside Russia, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes to the combat zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bridge over the river was hit over the weekend, a Russian military investigator said in a video published by high-profile pro-Kremlin TV commentator Vladimir Solovyev.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on the bridges have left Russia with limited options, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's defence ministry said on Monday Russia had thwarted Ukrainian attacks on three more villages in the Kursk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has also been accused of sending inexperienced conscripts to protect the Kursk region, unwilling to redeploy experienced fighters from the frontlines in eastern Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incursion has visibly worried Russians, prompting some in Kyiv to hope that sentiment could turn the country against the Kremlin's more than two-year war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accustomed to seeing the war as a television show, Russians are now seeing it up close and personal," Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you don't want to see the war, you have to end the war by forcing your 'leadership' to make peace on fair terms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, Moscow said it captured the town of Artemovo, which is called Zalizne in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zalizne had a population of around 5,000 at the start of 2022 – making it one of the largest places captured by Russian troops in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine also said Russian attacks killed four people in frontline towns on Monday, with a 71-year-old woman killed in her garden in Toretsk and three civilians in their 60s and 70s killed in the village of Zarichne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the front moved further west towards the city of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian officials announced the compulsory evacuation of families with children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are starting the forced evacuation of families with children from the Pokrovsk community," Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin said, ordering the "compulsory" evacuation of children and their parents from Pokrovsk and about a dozen surrounding villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said more than 53,000 people live in the area, including almost 4,000 children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Filashkin called the decision to evacuate "necessary and inevitable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has long tried to capture Pokrovsk, which lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Phil Donahue, a pioneering US talk show host, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Donahue's death in Manhattan on Sunday following a long illness was announced on NBC's Today Show, where he made frequent appearances from 1979 to 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Phil Donahue Show," launched in 1967, was the first on daytime US television to feature audience participation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It remained popular through the 1970s and into the 1980s, earning Donahue numerous Emmy Awards, and the format was adopted by future talk show hosts such as Oprah Winfrey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Donahue show was also notable for bringing conversations about controversial issues such as abortion, religion and sex to daytime television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Joe Biden in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He pioneered the live daytime talk show, holding a mirror up to America," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He interviewed everyone from our greatest stars to our forgotten neighbours, uniting us around the toughest issues of our time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donahue was married for 44 years to actress Marlo Thomas, the star of the 1960s sitcom "That Girl." (AFP)

    Blinken meets Israeli leaders at 'decisive moment'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Antony Blinken on Monday urged Israel and Hamas not to derail negotiations that he said may be a "last opportunity" to secure a Gaza truce and hostage release deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken, on his ninth visit to the Middle East since Hamas's October 7 attack triggered the war, said he was back in Israel "to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a decisive moment – probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security," Blinken said as he met Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US secretary of state later met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, and is due to travel on Tuesday to Egypt where ceasefire talks are expected to resume this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for delays in reaching a truce accord that diplomats say could help avert a wider conflagration in the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working to make sure that there is no escalation, that there are no provocations, that there are no actions that in any way could move us away from getting this deal over the line, or, for that matter, escalating the conflict to other places, and to greater intensity," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is time for it to get done. It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that could derail this process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Months of on-off negotiations with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have failed to produce an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of talks in Qatar last week, Hamas called on mediators to implement a framework outlined in late May by US President Joe Biden, rather than hold more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said on Sunday that a ceasefire was "still possible" and that the United States was "not giving up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Sunday, hours after Blinken had landed in the city, there was a bombing in Tel Aviv that was later claimed by the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One person – the bomber according to Israeli media – was killed and another wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The groups threatened to carry out more such attacks in Israel "as long as the occupation's massacres, the displacement of civilians and the policy of assassinations continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the bombing could have been more serious but the assailant detonated the explosives before managing to reach a more heavily populated area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as Israel and Hamas traded blame for delays in reaching a truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Qatar meeting last week, the United States submitted what mediators called a "bridging proposal," which Hamas on Sunday said "responds to Netanyahu's conditions" and includes terms that the Palestinian group would not accept.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas insisted on "a permanent ceasefire and a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip," saying Netanyahu wanted to keep Israeli forces at several strategic locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was "fully responsible for thwarting the efforts of the mediators," the Palestinian movement said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order for an agreement to be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday Netanyahu said that Hamas "remains obstinate" and must be pressured, a day after his office said Israeli negotiators had expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators also reported progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to the prime minister's governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 40,139 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan announced by Biden at the end of May would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks while Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence raged on in Gaza and along the Israel-Lebanon border where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, an Israeli soldier and two Hezbollah fighters were killed in cross-border clashes, the Israeli military and the Lebanese militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In southern Gaza, a medical source said three people were killed in Abassan village and witnesses reported Israeli air strikes near the Islamic University in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops were operating in southern and central Gaza, and that the air force "struck over 45 terrorist targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It later said that it had "expanded" operations in Khan Younis and the outskirts of Deir el-Balah. A medical source said a baby girl was killed and several women wounded in air strikes west of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fighting has devastated Gaza. A video posted to social media by a UN official showed a convoy passing scenes of utter destruction with almost every building reduced to rubble and the few still standing badly damaged. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least one person was killed and six people were missing after a luxury yacht was struck by a whirlwind and sank off the coast of the Sicilian capital Palermo, Italian media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "One body was located in the wreck but not yet recovered, at a depth of around 50 metres," a coast guard spokesman told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italy's fire brigade and coast guard had earlier said divers were searching for seven missing people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 56-metre-long luxury sailboat, which was British registered, sank with 22 people on board when it was hit by a violent storm at sunrise, the coast guard said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said one crew member and six passengers were missing, adding they were of British, American and Canadian nationality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight of those rescued, including a one-year-old child, were transferred to local hospitals and were all in a stable condition, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coast guard named the yacht as the "Bayesian", which was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The luxury ship has an aluminium hull, can reach a maximum speed of 15 knots and can carry 12 guests and a crew of up to 10, according to specialist online yacht sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boat left the Sicilian port of Milazzo on August 14 and was last tracked east of Palermo on Sunday evening, with a navigation status of "at anchor", according to vessel tracking app Vesselfinder. (Agencies)

    Cult of Alain Delon lives on in Japan
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alain Delon at a press conference in Tokyo in 1977. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766771_1_20240819164704.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French movie star Alain Delon, who died Sunday aged 88, said that in Japan he was like a deity. It wasn't an exaggeration, local fans told AFP on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In Japan I am a kind of a god," Delon told Figaro Magazine in 1986 on one of his many visits to Japan, when women fainted and crowds chased his limousine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People get real pleasure from touching me, caressing my hand, kissing my fingers," he told the magazine, reporting on fans showering him with gifts from red roses to statuettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's breakthrough role in Japan was "Purple Noon" (1960) as the handsome, homicidal anti-hero for the original screen version of Patricia Highsmith's thriller "The Talented Mr Ripley".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon played an "ambitious roughneck who loved money, women, and was ready for anything," said Sahoko Hata, a film critic who worked in the Japanese movie industry at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This thirst symbolised that of Japanese youth at the time," Hata told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon made the first of many visits to Japan in 1963 to promote his films, but also increasingly to appear in television variety shows and at society events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His TV appearances frequently broke audience records and up until the mid-1970s he regularly topped rankings of the Japan's most popular celebrities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My friends in their 70s and 80s are still all madly in love with him. Even at 88, he looked great," Delon fan Seta, 74, told AFP on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I used to think to myself: 'How is it possible for such an attractive person to exist in this world?'," the pensioner said in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was handsome, elegant and slightly mysterious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Kaoru Fujita, a woman in her late 50s shopping in Tokyo with her daughter, Delon's name was "synonymous with 'the handsome man'."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I have to think of someone to compare him with, I would say George Clooney or Brad Pitt," she told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't think there is anyone who is as so classically handsome as he was. As an actor he was one of a kind."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon gradually transformed himself into a sort of ambassador of French chic, becoming the face of Japanese fashion brand D'Urban and appearing in adverts for Mazda cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Alain Delon" brand was launched in 1978, mainly aimed at Japan and other Asian countries, selling accessories from watches and socks to cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1980s and 1990s, a Japanese tour operator even offered organised trips to Europe that featured a banquet in Paris in the presence of Delon himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Extra paid options included having the honour of presenting Delon with a bouquet or having a souvenir photo taken with him.

  Delon had a "dark, sad, mysterious, ambitious side, but also a bit of a loser", Yoshi Yatabe, a former programmer of the Tokyo International Film Festival, told AFP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This dark side really appealed to Japanese viewers who tend to like losers. In kabuki theatre, for example, the audience sympathises with the weakest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "France and Europe were a very far away place for me, so I would always wonder where he came from," remembered pensioner Mikiko Tsuburaya, 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was still a child, not a grown up yet (when he was popular). I would look at him as someone living in another world," the pensioner said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping hosted Vietnam's new top leader To Lam in Beijing on Monday, in Lam's first overseas trip since being named general secretary of the country's Communist Party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi welcomed Lam with a military parade outside the Great Hall of the People, before the pair held talks and signed cooperation documents inside the state building off Tiananmen Square.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the two ruling communist parties in the world today, China and Vietnam should uphold the original spirit of friendship, continue the traditional friendship...and continue to deepen the strategically important Sino-Vietnamese shared community of destiny," Xi told Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congratulating Lam, Xi said if the two countries adhered to a "common endeavour of promoting the cause of world socialism, we believe that our road will be wider and wider."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said Xi had guided China to become a "strong and prosperous country", and lauded him for developing Beijing's "role towards peace, cooperation and development in the region and the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was formally named Vietnam's leader earlier this month, pledging to "speed up" a sweeping anti-graft campaign that has snared thousands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ascension came two weeks after the death of Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades, who presided over the so-called "blazing furnace" crackdown on corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam had already assumed the largely ceremonial role of president in May after his predecessor resigned in the face of the vast anti-graft purge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But now as the Communist Party of Vietnam's general secretary, Lam is the most powerful figure in the country's leadership structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His three-day trip to China has already taken him to Guangzhou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last December, China and Vietnam pledged to deepen bilateral ties when Xi visited the country, his first time there in six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That trip came after Vietnam and the United States upgraded diplomatic ties during US President Joe Biden's visit in September 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam has long pursued a "bamboo diplomacy" approach, striving to stay on good terms with both China and the United States. (AFP)

    Tokyo shrine vandalised again: Japan authorities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tokyo shrine seen as a symbol of Japan's past militarism on Monday reported a second case of graffiti in three months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo honours 2.5 million mostly Japanese killed in wars since the late 19th century, including convicted war criminals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials regularly pay homage at Yasukuni, as did three government ministers and scores of other lawmakers on the 79th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such visits have angered some of Japan's Asian neighbours and former victims of its imperialism, especially China and South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Yasukuni shrine official confirmed the new case of graffiti to reporters, without elaborating further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late May, a Chinese man allegedly conspired with two others to spray-paint the word "toilet" in red on a pillar at the shrine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jiang Zhuojun, 29, who lived north of Tokyo, was later arrested "on suspicion of vandalism and disrespect for a place of worship", Tokyo police said in July. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese and Philippine vessels collided on Monday during a confrontation near Xianbin Reef, also known as the Sabina Shoal, in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chinese Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu said a Philippine coast guard ship ignored repeated warnings from the Chinese side and intentionally sailed towards a Chinese coast guard vessel on maritime enforcement duty, causing the scrape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Philippine side bore full responsibility for the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a regular Foreign Ministry briefing, spokeswoman Mao Ning said the Philippine vessels' actions had seriously violated China's sovereignty, adding China "will continue to take resolute and forceful measures in accordance with the law to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later the Philippine government said that two of its coast guard ships had been damaged in collisions with Chinese vessels that it said were conducting "unlawful and aggressive manoeuvres". (Agencies)

    Ernesto restrengthens into Atlantic hurricane

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766687_1_20240819064816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ernesto restrengthened into a hurricane on Sunday as it travelled well off the shore of eastern United States, threatening wind and rain along the US and Canadian coasts after pummelling Puerto Rico and Bermuda.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hurricane, whose centre is forecast to pass near southeastern Newfoundland, Canada late on Monday into Tuesday, was creating dangerous conditions for residents and vacationers along the North American Atlantic seaboard, the US National Hurricane Center said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beach goers should be aware that there is a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and should stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards," the NHC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ernesto brushed past Puerto Rico earlier in the week leaving more than 600,000 customers without power, then hit Bermuda directly on Saturday, causing more than 70 percent of customers to lose electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Weeks, Bermuda's minister of national security, reported on Sunday that the island "made it through Hurricane Ernesto without any injuries or major incidents," according to The Royal Gazette newspaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Packing maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometres per hour, Ernesto was a Category 1 storm on the five-level Saffir-Simpson scale as of the NHC's latest advisory at 5:00 pm (2100 GMT) on Sunday, with some increase in speed expected overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swells from Ernesto are affecting parts of the Bahamas, Bermuda, the US East Coast and Atlantic Canada, the NHC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect, with the storm located some 520 miles south of Halifax in Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warmer-than-normal Atlantic waters threaten to supercharge this year's hurricane season, scientists have warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on. (AFP)

    Putin arrives in Azerbaijan for state visit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Vladimir Putin is greeted by Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766680_1_20240819043411.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Azerbaijan's capital Baku on Sunday for a two-day state visit, Russian news agencies reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russian television broadcast images of the Russian president's plane as it arrived in Baku in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit to the Caucasus country, a close partner of both Moscow and Turkey but also a major energy supplier to Western countries, comes against the backdrop of an unprecedented Ukrainian military offensive on Russian soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is due to hold talks with his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev on bilateral relations and "international and regional problems," the Kremlin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two leaders were dining on Sunday evening at the Azerbaijani president's official residence, local official news agency Asertac said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, Aliyev and Putin will sign joint documents and make statements to the press, said Russian agency Ria Novosti.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin will also lay a wreath on the tomb of Heydar Aliyev, father of the current leader, who was president from 1993 to 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Kremlin said they would also discuss "the question of settling (the conflict) between Azerbaijan and Armenia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Azerbaijan reconquered the mountainous enclave in September 2023 from the Armenian separatists who had held it for three decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenia accused Russia of inadequate support in its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Armenia has sought to deepen its ties with Western countries, especially the United States, much to the annoyance of Moscow, which considers both former Soviet republics to be in its sphere of influence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Azerbaijan is a major producer of natural gas, to whom many European countries turned to make up for the sharp reduction in Russian deliveries after the start of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also hosting the COP29 climate conference in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin's last visit to Azerbaijan was in September 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has been under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court since March 2023 for the "deportation" of Ukrainian children to Russia, an accusation the Kremlin denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the threat of arrest has limited Putin's travels abroad, Azerbaijan is not a signatory to the Rome Statute treaty that established the ICC. (AFP)

    Blinken in Israel as Netanyahu calls Hamas 'obstinate'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Antony Blinken arrives in Tel Aviv for his ninth trip to the Middle East since war broke out in October. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766674_1_20240819005215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's prime minister, under pressure at home and from abroad to reach a ceasefire deal with Hamas, on Sunday accused the militants of obstinance in Gaza truce talks as top US diplomat Antony Blinken landed in Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Making his ninth trip to the Middle East since the Gaza war began when Hamas attacked Israel in October, the US secretary of state is to meet Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders in a renewed bid to seal a deal that could help avert a wider conflagration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken is later set to travel on Tuesday to Cairo, where ceasefire talks will resume in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday reiterated that it is Palestinian Islamist group Hamas that must be pressured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hamas, up to this moment, remains obstinate. It did not even send a representative to the talks in Doha. Therefore, the pressure should be directed at Hamas and (Yahya) Sinwar, not at the Israeli government," Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting, referring to the Hamas chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western ally Jordan, hostage supporters protesting in Israel, and Hamas itself have called for pressure on Netanyahu in order that an agreement be reached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right members crucial to his governing coalition oppose any truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of Blinken's visit, the foreign ministers of Britain and France were on Friday also in Israel to stress the urgency of a Gaza deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In late May, US President Joe Biden laid out a framework which he said was proposed by Israel. The UN Security Council later endorsed the proposal, which would freeze fighting for an initial six weeks as Israeli hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and humanitarian aid enters the besieged Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the truce talks in Doha last Thursday and Friday, Hamas called on mediators to implement the Biden framework rather than holding more negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas also announced its opposition to what it called "new conditions" from Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, Netanyahu's office in a statement said Israeli negotiators have expressed "cautious optimism" about reaching a Gaza truce deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have also reported progress and a US official said remaining gaps were "bridgeable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after Biden said "we are closer than we have ever been" to a deal, Hamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed as "an illusion" such optimistic talk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous announcements that a deal was close during the months of on-off truce negotiations proved unfounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the stakes have risen since the late July killings in quick succession of Iran-backed militant leaders, including Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, and as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, deepened with a feared polio outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli evacuation orders have "reduced the safe zone" in the south of the territory, leaving "no more space" for displaced Palestinians, said Samah Dib, 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people "are sleeping on the street" while clean water is scarce and "there's food at the markets, but it's very expensive and we have no money left," said Dib, who like almost all Gazans is among the displaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As efforts towards a long-sought truce continued, so has the violence in Gaza but also in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Lebanon, where Israeli forces and Hamas's Iran-backed ally Hezbollah have traded near-daily fire throughout the war. They did so again on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence rescuers in Hamas-run Gaza reported seven killed in Israeli bombardment of Deir el-Balah and four others in air strikes on the northern Jabalia refugee camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest killings helped push the Gaza health ministry's war death toll to 40,099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that started the war resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said troops continued operations in central and southern Gaza and "eliminated" militants in Rafah, on the territory's border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the Israeli-designated safe zone in southern Gaza's Al-Mawasi, Lina Saleha, 44, said she could hear "constant artillery shelling" and the rumble of tanks "getting closer."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's not a good sign and we're terrified and afraid," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the West Bank, Israel said late on Saturday it had killed "two senior Hamas officials" in Jenin. Hamas's armed wing confirmed the deaths of two militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lebanon, the UN said three peacekeepers were lightly injured in a blast in the country's south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and its regional allies have vowed retaliation for Haniyeh's death in Tehran – which Israel has not claimed responsibility for – and for an Israeli strike in Beirut that killed a top Hezbollah commander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Israel, Blinken will seek to "conclude the agreement for a ceasefire and release of hostages and detainees," the US State Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Out of 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack, 111 are still held in Gaza including 39 the military says are dead. More than 100 were freed during a one-week truce in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club watchdog said that since the Gaza war began, Israeli forces have detained "more than 10,000 Palestinians" in the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in 1967.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a rally in the Israeli city of Haifa on Saturday, Guri Lotto, 51, said he was protesting to "put pressure on the government" to secure a hostage release deal and end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US official travelling with Blinken said on condition of anonymity that "the feeling is... that various sticking points that existed before are bridgeable, and that work's going to continue."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine said on Sunday it had struck a second key bridge in the Kursk region, seeking to disrupt Moscow's supply routes as Kyiv's unprecedented incursion on Russian soil stretched through its second week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia meanwhile ramped up pressure in east Ukraine, claiming to capture another village just a few kilometres from the Ukrainian-held logistics hub of Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Minus one more bridge," Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram, publishing an aerial video of a blast tearing through a bridge near the Russian town of Zvannoye.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Air Force aviation continues to deprive the enemy of logistical capabilities with precision air strikes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear when Ukraine carried out the attack. Oleshchuk did not give a date and Russian military bloggers shared photos of destruction from what appeared to be the same bridge dated on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv sent troops and armoured vehicles across the border on August 6, in its biggest attack on Russian territory since the Kremlin launched its assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Ukraine announced it had destroyed a separate bridge in the neighbouring town of Glushkovo, both of which lie on the river Seym that winds through the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on both bridges have left Russia with limited options to cross the river in the area, according to Russian military bloggers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow said the destruction of one of the bridges had hindered evacuation efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian defence ministry said in a briefing it was pushing back against Ukraine's forces near several villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 120,000 people have fled the region since fighting began, according to Russian authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia said on Sunday its forces had captured Svyrydonivka, another frontline settlement some 15 kilometres away from Pokrovsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pokrovsk lies on the intersection of a key road that supplies Ukrainian troops and towns across the eastern front and has long been a target for the Russian army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a result of active operations, units of the Centre grouping of troops have liberated the village of Sviridonovka," Moscow's defence ministry said, using the Russian name for the village.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian forces have been inching towards Pokrovsk for months, taking a string of tiny villages as they seek to reach the outskirts of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of Pokrovsk's military administration, Sergiy Dobryak, warned earlier this week that Russia was a little over 10 kilometres from the outskirts of the city and urged remaining residents to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian forces earlier on Sunday announced they had thwarted a Russian missile attack on the capital Kyiv where air raid sirens sounded before dawn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the third ballistic missile attack on the capital in August with a clear interval of six days between each attack," the Kyiv City Military Administration posted on Telegram after the early morning barrage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No damage or casualties were reported from the attack, which the administration said likely involved "North Korean ballistic missiles of the KN-23 type."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian drones attacked an oil storage facility in Russia's southern Rostov region early on Sunday morning, sparking a large fire, the local governor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos published on social media showed thick black smoke and bursts of flames coming from the site of the blaze, which the governor said was in the town of Proletarsk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the southeast of the Rostov region, air defences repelled a drone attack. As a result of falling debris on the territory of industrial storage facilities in Proletarsk, a diesel fuel fire broke out," Governor Vasily Golubev said on Telegram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At 05:35 (0235 GMT), firefighting at the industrial facility in Proletarsk was suspended due to a second drone attack," he added in an update to the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one was injured and firefighting efforts resumed shortly after, he said in a later post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Proletarsk is some 250 kilometres from the Ukraine border and some 350 kilometres from Kyiv-held areas of fighting on the eastern Ukrainian front line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has repeatedly targeted oil and gas facilities in Russia since the conflict began, some hundreds of kilometres from its borders, in what it has called "fair" retaliation for attacks on its energy infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised his forces for hitting oil facilities in Russia, saying the attacks would help bring a "just end" to the conflict. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French actor Alain Delon, who melted the hearts of millions of film fans whether playing a murderer, hoodlum or hitman in his postwar heyday, has died, French media reported on Sunday. He was 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delon had been in poor health since suffering a stroke in 2019, rarely leaving his estate in Douchy, in France's Val de Loire region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With striking blue eyes, Delon was sometimes referred to as the "French Frank Sinatra" for his handsome looks, a comparison Delon disliked. Unlike Sinatra, who always denied connections with the Mafia, Delon openly acknowledged his shady pals in the underworld.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a 1970 interview with the New York Times, Delon was asked about such acquaintances, one of whom was among the last "Godfathers" of the underworld in the Mediterranean port of Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most of them the gangsters I know ... were my friends before I became an actor," he said. "I don't worry about what a friend does. Each is responsible for his own act. It doesn't matter what he does."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon shot to fame in two films by Italian director Luchino Visconti, "Rocco and His Brothers" in 1960 and "The Leopard" in 1963.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He starred alongside venerable French elder Jean Gabin in Henri Verneuil's 1963 film "Melodie en Sous-Sol" ("Any Number Can Win") and was a major hit in Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 "Le Samourai" ("The Godson"). The role of a philosophical contract killer involved minimal dialogue and frequent solo scenes, and Delon shone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon became a star in France and was idolised by men and women in Japan, but never made it as big in Hollywood despite performing with American cinema giants, including Burt Lancaster when the Frenchman played apprentice-hitman Scorpio in the eponymous 1973 film.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 1970 film "Borsalino", he starred with fellow French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, playing gangsters who come to blows in an unforgettable, stylised fight over a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowning moments also included 1969 erotic thriller "La Piscine" ("The Swimming Pool"), where Delon paired up with real-life lover Romy Schneider, in a sultry French Riviera saga of jealously and seduction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born just outside Paris on November 8, 1935, Delon started life on the back foot: he was put in foster care aged four after his parents divorced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He ran away from home at least once and was expelled several times from boarding schools before joining the Marines at 17 and serving in then French-ruled Indochina. There too he got into trouble over a stolen jeep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in France in the mid-50s, he worked as a porter at Paris wholesale food market, Les Halles, and spent time in the red-light Pigalle district before migrating to the cafes of the bohemian St. Germain des Pres area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There he met French actor Jean-Claude Brialy, who took him to the Cannes Film Festival, where he attracted the attention of an American talent scout who arranged a screen test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his film debut in 1957 in "Quand la femme s'en mele" ("Send a Woman When the Devil Fails").
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SULPHUROUS FRIENDS
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon was a businessman as well as an actor, leveraging his looks to sell branded cosmetics and dabbling in race-horses with old underworld friends. He invested in a racehorse stable with Jacky "Le Mat" Imbert, a notorious figure in a thriving Marseille crime scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's more louche friendships exploded to the surface when a former bodyguard-cum-confidant, a young Yugoslav called Stefan Markovic, was found dead in a bag, with a bullet in his head, discarded in a rubbish dump near Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor was interrogated and cleared by police but the "Markovic Affair" snowballed into a national scandal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man police charged with the Markovic murder - he was later acquitted - was Francois Marcantoni, a Corsican cafe owner and friend of Delon who thrived in the hustle and bustle of the Pigalle district in the aftermath of World War Two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon was outspoken off-stage and courted controversy when he did so - notably when he said he regretted the abolition of the death penalty and spoke disparagingly of gay marriage, which was legalised in France in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He publicly defended the far-right National Front and telephoned its founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, an old friend, to congratulate him when the party did well in local elections in 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's lovers included Schneider and German model-turned-singer Nico, with whom he had a son. In 1964, he married Nathalie Barthelemy and fathered a second son before ending the marriage and embarking on a 15-year relationship with Mireille Darc. He had two more children with Dutch model Rosalie van Breemen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a January 2018 interview, Delon told Paris Match he was fed up with modern life and had a chapel and tomb ready for him on the grounds of his home near Geneva, and for his Belgian shepherd dog, called Loubo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If I die before him I'll ask the vet to let us go together. He will give the dog an injection so he can die in my arms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delon's last major public appearance was to receive an honorary Palme d'or at the Cannes film festival in May 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his last years, Delon was the centre of a family feud over his care, which made headlines in French media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April 2024 a judge placed Delon under "reinforced curatorship", meaning he no longer had full freedom to manage his assets. He was already under legal protection over concerns over his health and well-being. (Reuters)

    Thai king formally appoints Paetongtarn Shinawatra
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paetongtarn is the third Shinawatra to be prime minister. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766631_1_20240818125558.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Thai king on Sunday formally appointed Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 37-year-old daughter of controversial billionaire ex-premier Thaksin, as Thailand's new prime minister.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn, the kingdom's youngest ever PM, comes to office after a court sacked the previous premier and disbanded the main opposition party, throwing Thailand's ever-febrile political scene into a new round of turmoil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is the third Shinawatra to be prime minister, but will hope to avoid the fate of her father and aunt Yingluck, both of whom were thrown out of power in military coups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn received King Maha Vajiralongkorn's official written command to form a government in a ceremony at the headquarters of a former pro-Thaksin TV station soon after 9:30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called on all Thais to work together to help revitalise the country's sluggish economy, which has struggled to bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As head of the government I will work with parliament with an open heart, open to all ideas to help develop the country," she said after the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fellow Thais, this duty cannot be done by the prime minister alone. I hope I will be able to coordinate the power of all generations, all talented people in Thailand -- from the cabinet, the coalition, civil servants, private sector and the people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, 75, was a prominent attendee at the ceremony, standing alongside Paetongtarn's husband in the front row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She has to work hard. Her strong point is that she is young, she can ask anyone for help -- she is humble," Thaksin told reporters after the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Twenty-three years ago she was standing behind my back but today I was standing behind her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn heads a coalition government led by her Pheu Thai party -- the latest incarnation of the political movement founded by her father in the early 2000s -- but including some pro-military groups long opposed to Thaksin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her elevation to the top job came about after the kingdom's Constitutional Court sacked previous premier Srettha Thavisin on Wednesday for breaching ethics rules by appointing a cabinet minister with a criminal conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand has been dominated for more than 20 years by a tussle for dominance between Thaksin and his allies and the kingdom's conservative pro-military, pro-royalist elite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties linked to the former telecoms tycoon and one-time Manchester City owner have repeatedly won elections, only to find their governments upended by coups and court rulings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is a relative newcomer, running the hotel arm of the family business until late 2022 when she entered politics ahead of last year's general election where Pheu Thai was unexpectedly beaten into second place by the upstart progressive Move Forward Party (MFP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite winning most seats in last year's election, MFP was blocked from forming a government by conservative junta-appointed senators spooked by its promise to reform royal insult laws and break up powerful business monopolies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That allowed Pheu Thai to strike an uneasy coalition deal with pro-military parties once staunchly opposed to Thaksin and his followers, leading to Srettha's ascension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a year later, he became the third prime minister from a Thaksin-backed party to be kicked out by the Constitutional Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn will be watched closely for signs of influence exerted by her father, who is the most influential but controversial politician in modern Thai history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked Sunday if he would take an official role as her advisor, Thaksin said: "Not neccessary. I am old. I am 75 years old, She can ask me anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He transformed the kingdom's politics in the early 2000s with populist policies that won him and his party enduring loyalty from the rural masses -- and two election victories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that success came at a cost: he was despised by Thailand's powerful elites and conservative establishment, who saw his rule as corrupt, authoritarian and socially destabilising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ousted as prime minister by the army in 2006, Thaksin went into exile two years later but never stopped commenting on national affairs -- or meddling in them, according to his critics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He returned last year on the day Srettha became PM, and was immediately jailed on graft and abuse of office charges dating back to his time in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his eight-year sentence was quickly cut to one year by the king, and he was then soon granted parole because of his age and poor health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday he was granted a royal pardon, making him a free man two weeks before his parole was due to end. (AFP)

    Opposition leader surfaces to lead protest in Caracas

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who has mostly been in hiding since July 28 presidential polls, led a "Protest for the Truth" in Caracas on Saturday against Nicolas Maduro's disputed claim of having won reelection.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Atop an opposition campaign truck, and surrounded by motorcyclists and cars waving the national flag, she joined hundreds of supporters gathered in the capital in response to her call for mass gatherings in more than 300 cities in Venezuela and abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Machado had called for the anti-Maduro movement to "remain firm and united" in the face of threats and violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They're trying to scare us, to divide us, to paralyze us, to demoralize us, but they can't because they are absolutely entrenched in their lies (and) violence," she wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many protesters waved printed copies of election records from their voting stations, which they say prove the opposition won.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) proclaimed Maduro the winner of a third six-year term until 2031, giving him 52 percent of votes cast on July 28 but without providing a detailed breakdown of the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition says polling-station-level results show its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia took more than two-thirds of the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia replaced Machado on the ballot after she was ruled out of running by institutions loyal to the regime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we keep quiet, this makes no sense," said demonstrator Adriana Calzadilla, a 55-year-old teacher in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a criminal government that wants to hold on to power. I smell freedom, I have nothing to fear."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-Maduro protests have claimed 25 lives so far, with nearly 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested since election day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Early on Saturday, a heavy security presence took shape in the capital, with two armoured vehicles and 40 motorcycle-mounted troops controlling access to the low-income Petare neighborhood, a few miles from the opposition's gathering point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media reported similar deployments in other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one of the first overseas demonstrations to get under way Saturday, more than 100 Venezuelans in Australia rallied in Sydney, waving national flags and balloons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a strong message to our people in Venezuela. We are with you, and we want the world to listen what we are saying," said protest organizer Rina Rivas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear if Gonzalez Urrutia, also in hiding, will attend Saturday's march. He last appeared in public at a protest on July 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro had called for Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia to be arrested. He accuses them of seeking to foment a "coup d'etat." (AFP)

    Typhoon Ampil veers away from Japan

<div class="itemFullText">
 A typhoon that blasted parts of Japan with more than 200-kilometre-per-hour winds moved out to sea on Saturday, mostly sparing the capital and allowing trains and some flights to resume.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tokyo and its surrounding areas had been on high alert on Friday for Ampil's approach, with transport services, trips, events and school classes cancelled en masse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm was packing gusts of 216 kilometres per hour on Saturday morning when it veered away from the archipelago and headed northeast into the Pacific.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, the Japan Meteorological Agency warned that "some areas in the northern part of Japan are experiencing heavy rain due to warm, humid air around the typhoon".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please be advised that the risk of landslides has been significantly elevated by the heavy rain so far in some areas", the weather agency said in an advisory on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although a severe hit on Tokyo never came, some minor injuries and damage were reported, including broken windows, toppled trees and broken utility poles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most parts of Japan's bullet train network went back to normal on Saturday after the Central Japan Railway Company closed a busy section between Tokyo and Nagoya the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "JR Central bullet trains are business as usual today," the railway firm said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airlines were still being affected to a degree, with broadcaster NHK saying All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines had together scrapped 68 flights as of Saturday morning, after hundreds of cancellations the day before. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris unveiled an economic blueprint on Friday heavy on popular measures to cut costs for Americans, while attacking powerful companies for price gouging, as she fleshed out her election platform ahead of the Democratic National Convention.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The speech in North Carolina -- a vital battleground state -- was the first time Harris, who jumped into the race against Donald Trump less than a month ago, laid out a vision for combating the inflation which soured voters on her boss President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Promising to champion an "opportunity economy," she said "building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an effort to connect with voters angry at Biden, Harris recounted her modest background, noting that she'd worked in a McDonald's during university studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And she acknowledged that while "by any measure, our economy is the strongest in the world..., many Americans don't yet feel that progress in their daily lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking a leaf from Trump's populist playbook, she threw out the idea of hefty tax breaks for families with children, help in accessing government-subsidized health care, and support for first-time homebuyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This came on top of an announcement Thursday that the White House has negotiated reduced prices for retirees purchasing common medicines from major drug manufacturers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris also called on Congress to pass a first federal ban on so-called "price-gouging" by food companies that unfairly increase prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the convention starting in Chicago on Monday, the proposals were meant to flesh out a come-from-behind campaign that has seen Harris spark huge enthusiasm in the Democratic Party, but offer little detail on how she'd govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice president, vying to become the first woman president, hopes the headline-grabbing proposals will distance her from Biden's unpopular management of price surges that hit ordinary Americans in the wake of the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump and the Republicans are trying to tie Harris to 81-year-old Biden, who abruptly dropped his re-election bid on July 21 and endorsed his vice president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kamala Harris has had three-and-a-half years in office and all she's done is break the economy. Kamala can't shake the stench of Bidenomics," the Trump campaign said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trump campaign referred to an "inflation nightmare for American families" and claimed "Harris's vision is a Soviet-style communism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In reality, inflation is on a steady downward trend, while the US economy has avoided a much-feared recession, with strong job growth and record stock markets. However, the lingering effects from the Covid-related upheaval continue to be felt for regular consumers, ranging from prices on some food items to high interest rates for home buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What's not yet clear is how the generous Harris tax breaks would be paid for. The non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that Harris's measures would cost more than US$1.7 trillion over the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, has mirrored some of Trump's populist strategy, including a proposal to end taxes on restaurant workers' tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, Harris is drawing a contrast with 78-year-old Trump's economic vision, painting him as being pro-millionaires and risking sharply increased costs for Americans through his proposal to slap tariffs of 10-20 percent on global imports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations... I will fight to give money back to working and middle-class Americans," Harris said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kyiv said on Friday its incursion into Russian territory had advanced, claiming it aimed to force Russia to negotiate on "fair" terms, as Moscow's troops announced new gains in eastern Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv's troops last week launched a major counter-offensive into Russia's Kursk region, sending more than 120,000 people fleeing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the Ukrainian military Oleksandr Syrsky told President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday that "the troops continue to fight and have advanced in some areas from one to three kilometres (0.6 to 1.8 miles) towards the enemy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said in his evening address: "We see that the occupier is suffering losses, and this is useful, very useful for our defence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky's aide Mykhailo Podolyak said earlier Friday that Ukraine wanted to negotiate "on our own terms" by inflicting "significant tactical defeats on Russia".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have absolutely no plans to beg: 'Please, sit down to negotiate', he wrote on X, saying that Kyiv in the Kursk region is using military means to "persuade Russia to enter a fair negotiation process".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Vladimir Putin has said Russia would declare a ceasefire only if Kyiv withdraws from the four regions that Russia claims to have annexed but only partially controls -- Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine meanwhile claims to have seized more than 1,100 square kilometres of Russian territory, in the biggest attack by a foreign army on Russian soil since World War II. (AFP)

    China backs Myanmar's democratic transition: Wang Yi

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi shakes hand with Eksiri Pintaruchi, Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Thailand, during the 9th Mekong-Lancang Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Chiang Mai.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said China supports a plan by Myanmar's military government to hold fresh elections and return the country to a "democratic transition".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Thailand to attend a regional meeting, Wang said that China also supports a peace plan agreed to by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), known as its five-point "consensus".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We support Myanmar in achieving domestic political reconciliation within the framework of its constitution... and restarting the process of democratic transition through elections," the foreign minister said at the meeting in Chiang Mai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian country has been in turmoil ever since the military deposed the government of Aung San Suu Kyi and seized power in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coup upended a 10-year experiment with democracy and a subsequent military crackdown has sparked fighting with established ethnic minority armed groups and newer pro-democracy "People's Defence Forces".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is an ally of the military government, but analysts say it also maintains ties with ethnic groups fighting the military in Myanmar's northern Shan state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar's government has promised to hold fresh elections but has repeatedly delayed a timetable for polls as it struggles to crush opposition to its coup across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week Wang met military chief Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw and "discussed and exchanged views openly regarding free and fair multi-party general elections".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Myanmar is deeply divided by conflict, with civilians caught up in near-daily bomb blasts, targeted killings and clashes between the military and opponents of its coup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has acknowledged it does not fully control swathes of the country and in February activated a long-dormant conscription law to replenish its ranks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has said it will hold polls next year after conducting a nationwide census. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paetongtarn Shinawatra won the backing of parliament to become Thailand's youngest prime minister on Friday, only a day after she was thrust into the spotlight amid an unrelenting power struggle between the warring elites.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old daughter of divisive political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra won easily with 319 votes, or nearly two-thirds of the house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was not present in parliament and watched the vote from her Pheu Thai Party's headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn now faces a baptism of fire, just two days after ally Srettha Thavisin was dismissed as premier by a judiciary central to Thailand's two decades of intermittent turmoil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At stake could be the legacy and political future of the billionaire Shinawatra family, whose once unstoppable populist juggernaut suffered its first election defeat in over two decades last year, and had to do a deal with its bitter enemies in the military to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn will immediately face challenges on multiple fronts, with the economy floundering and the popularity of her Pheu Thai Party dwindling, having yet to deliver on its flagship cash handout programme worth 500 billion baht.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn has never served in government and will become Thailand's second female prime minister and the third Shinawatra to take the top job after aunt Yingluck Shinawatra, and 75-year-old father Thaksin, the country's most influential and polarising politician. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea broke a century-old weather record with the 26th so-called tropical night in a row -- when the temperature stays above 25 degrees Celsius, according to official data released Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Much of the world is enduring a summer of extreme heat, with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning last month of an "extreme heat epidemic", and calling for action to limit the impact of heatwaves intensified by climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight temperatures in the South Korean capital Seoul have sizzled above 25 degrees Celsius for 26 days in a row, officials said, marking the longest streak since modern weather observation began in 1907.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The record ties a streak set in 2018, but the weather agency counts the most recent as the benchmark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The intense heat in Seoul is expected to continue, according to Seoul's Office of Metrology, setting a new record every day until next week. (AFP)

    Biden says he "beat Big Pharma" with drug price deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has negotiated down the prices of 10 top-selling prescription drugs used by Medicare by as much as 79 percent, hoping to save US$6 billion in the first year as part of a plan hailed on Thursday by President Joe Biden with the aim to ease anger about high prices ahead of November elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022, was the first to allow Medicare to negotiate prices for some of the most costly drugs that the programme covers for 66 million people. The new prices will go into effect in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We finally beat Big Pharma," Biden said at an event in Largo, Maryland, alongside Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration hopes the savings will ease Americans' anger about high prices, an issue they frequently say is their top concern headed into the closely contested November 5 presidential election between Harris and Republican former president Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My entire career, I have worked to hold bad actors accountable and lower the cost of prescription drugs," Harris said. "Medicare can use that (collective bargaining) power to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new prices represent cuts to individual list prices that do not reflect any rebates and discounts the government may already be getting for the drugs, although the government's estimated savings from the negotiations do take those discounts into account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' tie-breaking Senate vote passed the law that allows for the drug-price negotiations, which no Republicans supported. In a statement, she also pointed to her work as California attorney general holding "big pharma accountable for their deceptive and illegal practices."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration said people covered by Medicare, which mostly serves Americans aged 65 and over, would also save US$1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs for the prescription medicines in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merck & Co's diabetes drug Januvia faces the steepest percentage price cut of the drugs on the list, decreasing 79 percent, while Novo Nordisk's insulin aspart products will face the second steepest of 76 percent, according to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other eight drugs on the list face cuts of between 68 percent and 38 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Drugmakers voiced their opposition to the new discounts that they said would not necessarily lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and could hinder future innovation. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden confirmed its first case of the viral infection mpox on Thursday, which was also the first case outside Africa, a day after the WHO declared the disease a global public health emergency for the second time in two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The person was infected while staying in a part of Africa where there was a large outbreak of the disease, Olivia Wigzell, director-general at the Swedish Public Health Agency, told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organisation made its announcement over mpox, which spreads through close contact, after an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to nearby countries of a more serious type of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now also during the afternoon had confirmation that we have one case in Sweden of the more grave type of mpox, the one called Clade I," Health and Social Affairs Minister Jakob Forssmed told the press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wigzell said the person who was infected had received care and instructions in line with the health agency's recommendations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The case is the first caused by Clade I that has been diagnosed outside the African continent. The affected person has also been infected during a stay in an area of Africa where there is a large outbreak of mpox Clade I," she said. (Reuters)

    Five charged over death of 'Friends' actor Perry

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A floral tribute to Matthew Perry left by a fan in New York. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766362_2_20240816012519.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Criminal charges have been filed against five people in connection with the death of "Friends" star Matthew Perry nearly a year ago, law enforcement officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defendants include two doctors and an assistant to Perry who were part of "a broad underground criminal network" that distributed large quantities of the prescription drug ketamine to the actor and others, US Attorney Martin Estrada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These defendants took advantage of Mr Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves," Estrada said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry died at age 54 from "acute effects" of ketamine, a powerful sedative, in addition to other factors that caused the actor to lose consciousness and drown in his hot tub last October, an autopsy said. For months, Los Angeles homicide detectives and federal agents have been investigating how Perry obtained the prescription drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A December 2023 autopsy report concluded Perry died from the "acute effects of ketamine," which combined with other factors caused the actor to lose consciousness and slip below the water in the hot tub at his Los Angeles home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Toxicology tests found Perry's body contained dangerously high levels of ketamine, a short-acting anaesthetic with hallucinogenic properties. Typically, people with that much ketamine in their systems are in general aesthesia during surgery, and being monitored by professionals, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other contributing factors in his death were drowning, coronary artery disease and the effects of the opioid-addiction medicine buprenorphine, which was also detected in his system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perry had publicly acknowledged decades of drug and alcohol abuse, including during the years he starred as Chandler Bing on the hit 1990s television sitcom "Friends." He had been sober for 19 months with no known relapses before his death, according to interviews cited in his autopsy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witness interviews in the autopsy report said he had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. But his last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, so the ketamine found in his system by medical examiners would have been introduced since that last infusion, the autopsy said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand’s populist Pheu Thai party on Thursday nominated its party chief, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, in a Parliament vote for the country’s new leader after former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin was removed by a court order over an ethical violation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn said she was ready to work for the country to move it forward and promised give her best, after securing her candidacy for prime minister by the governing alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined, together and will push the country forward," she told a press conference ahead of Friday's parliamentary vote on a new premier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paetongtarn is the youngest daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is seen as force behind Pheu Thai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was the first Thai politician ever to win an overall majority of seats. The residual popularity of Thaksin is a factor in the support for Paetongtarn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Paetongtarn is approved by Parliament's vote she would become Thailand’s second female prime minister, and the country’s third leader from the Shinwatra family after her father and her aunt Yingluck Shinawatra. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan lifted on Thursday a week-old warning that a "megaquake", potentially causing colossal damage and loss of life could strike, with the government telling people their lives could now "go back to normal".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alert that such a catastrophe might hit the archipelago of 125 million people prompted thousands of Japanese to cancel holidays and stock up on essentials, emptying shelves in some stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since there were no abnormalities detected in seismic activity and crustal deformation, the special call for attention ended at 5pm," disaster management minister Yoshifumi Matsumura said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it doesn't mean the risk [of a major earthquake] has been eliminated," Matsumura told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been asking for special precautions, such as sleeping while being prepared to evacuate immediately. But we will no longer ask for these steps, and the people of Japan are free to go back to normal lifestyles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last Thursday, Japan's weather agency said the likelihood of a megaquake was "higher than normal" following a magnitude 7.1 jolt earlier in the day that injured 15 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was a particular kind of tremor known as a subduction megathrust quake, which in the past has occurred in pairs and can unleash massive tsunamis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The advisory concerned the Nankai Trough between two tectonic plates in the Pacific Ocean.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 800-kilometre undersea gully runs parallel to Japan's Pacific coast, including off the Tokyo region, the world's biggest urban area and home to around 40 million people. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has resigned, coming nearly four months after the Ivy League university was rocked by campus protests over Israel's war in Gaza. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766252_1_20240815105933.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned Wednesday after a brief, tumultuous tenure that saw the head of the prestigious New York college grapple with protests over the Israel-Hamas war and criticism over how the school handled divisions related to the conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Anti-war protests and encampments at Columbia and campuses across the United States were a flashpoint in debates about US support for Israel in its campaign against Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics said the protests at Columbia and elsewhere veered into anti-Semitism and intimidation, culminating in Shafik being questioned before the US Congress along with other university presidents and accused of not keeping Jewish students safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters -- many of whom were themselves Jewish -- said demonstrators' anti-Israel views were being conflated with anti-Semitism. They also said that individual allegations of hate incidents were being used to distract from calls for a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead," Shafik wrote in an email announcing the move, according to student newspaper the Columbia Spectator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am making this announcement now so that new leadership can be in place before the new term begins."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests and encampments spread across US universities, protesters at times occupied buildings. In some cases there were clashes with police, while at other times pro-Israel protesters attacked the encampments. (Agencies)

    WHO declares mpox a global health emergency

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determining a disease outbreak as a "public health emergency of international concern" or PHEIC – the WHO's highest level of alert – can accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and co-operation to contain a disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact. It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Africa's top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 17,000 suspected mpox cases and 517 deaths have been reported on the African continent so far this year, a 160 percent increase in cases compared to the same period last year, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said. A total of 13 countries have reported cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A different form of the mpox virus – clade IIb – spread globally in 2022, largely through sexual contact among men who have sex with men. This prompted the WHO to declare a public health emergency then, which it ended 10 months later. (Reuters)

    Fresh Gaza peace talks to begin in Qatar

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766206_1_20240815010904.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult the Palestinian group afterwards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US has said it expects indirect talks to go ahead as planned in Qatar's capital Doha on Thursday, and that a ceasefire agreement was still possible, while warning that progress was needed urgently to avert a wider war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Axios reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed a trip to the Middle East that had been expected to begin on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three senior Iranian officials have said that only a ceasefire deal in Gaza would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israel will send the negotiations team on the agreed upon date, that's tomorrow August 15th, in order to finalise the details of the implementation of the framework agreement," government spokesperson David Mencer said in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation includes Israel's spy chief David Barnea, head of the domestic security service Ronen Bar and the military's hostages chief Nitzan Alon, a defence official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has voiced scepticism about the chances of the talks delivering real results, blaming Israel for stalling, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has been the main obstacle to sealing a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going to new negotiations allows the occupation to impose new conditions and employ the maze of negotiation to conduct more massacres," Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas' absence from the talks, however, does not eliminate the chances of progress since its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya is based in Doha and the group has open channels with Egypt and Qatar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hamas is committed to the proposal presented to it on July 2, which is based on the UN Security Council resolution and the Biden speech and the movement is prepared to immediately begin discussion over a mechanism to implement it," said Abu Zuhri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A source familiar with the matter said that Hamas wants the mediators to come back to them with a "serious response" from Israel. If that happens, the group says, it will meet mediators after the Thursday session. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Thailand's Constitutional Court removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office on Wednesday as it ruled against him in an ethics case. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766160_1_20240814165201.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thailand's Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin for appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who served jail time, raising the spectre of more political upheaval and a reset of the governing alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I respect the verdict. I reiterate that for the almost one year I have been in this role, I have tried with good intentions to lead the country with honesty," Srettha told reporters outside his office after the court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real estate tycoon Srettha becomes the fourth Thai premier in 16 years to be removed by verdicts by the same court, after it ruled he violated the constitution by appointing a minister who did not meet ethical standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's removal after less than a year in power means parliament must convene to choose a new premier, with the prospect of more uncertainty in a country dogged for two decades by coups and court rulings that have brought down multiple governments and political parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same court last week dissolved the anti-establishment Move Forward Party, the hugely popular opposition, ruling its campaign to reform a law against insulting the crown risked undermining the constitutional monarchy. It regrouped on Friday under a new party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha's Pheu Thai Party and its predecessors have borne the brunt of Thailand's turmoil, with two of its governments removed by coups in a long-running grudge match between the party's founders, the billionaire Shinawatra family, and their rivals in the conservative establishment and royalist military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision could rock a fragile truce between political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra and his enemies among the conservative elite and military old guard, which enabled the tycoon's return from 15 years of self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Srettha had maintained his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged attempt to bribe court staff, was above board. The bribery allegation was never proven and Pichit resigned in May.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kishida confirmed on Wednesday that he will not seek re-election as head of his party next month, meaning the end of his premiership.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday said he would not seek re-election as head of his party, meaning the end of his premiership after just under three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since 1945, is due to hold an internal leadership contest next month. Its popularity ratings have slumped because of rising prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this presidential election, it is necessary to show the people that the LDP is changing and the party is a new LDP," Kishida told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this, transparent and open elections and free and vigorous debate are important. The most obvious first step to show that the LDP will change is for me to step aside," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will not be running in the forthcoming presidential election."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida had informed senior administration officials of his intention not to run, media including national broadcaster NHK and Kyodo news reported earlier,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the ruling party is traditionally also prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida, 67, has been in office since October 2021, and has seen his and his party's poll ratings slide sharply in response to rising prices hitting Japanese incomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His cabinet's support rating has been languishing around 25 percent this year, according to an NHK poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's fourth-largest economy has also struggled to gain traction, with output shrinking 0.7 percent in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last November, Kishida announced a stimulus package worth 17 trillion yen (more than US$100 billion at the time) as he tried to ease the pressure from inflation and rescue his premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having seen prices barely move for years, Japanese voters have been reeling from rising prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, pushing up energy costs and putting pressure on the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite some recovery in recent weeks, the yen has been one of the world's worst-performing currencies over the past year, falling sharply against the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While welcome news to Japanese exporters, this makes imports pricier and stokes inflation for households.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even before November, the government had injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy over the past three years since the pandemic. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elusive street artist Banksy's ninth animal-themed mural in nine days, unveiled on Tuesday on a shutter outside London Zoo, depicted a gorilla releasing animals from the zoo, tying together the series of artworks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Claimed by the artist on Instagram, the mural outside London Zoo showed a gorilla lifting the shutter to free birds and a seal, with some animals staring out from the inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the latest in Banksy's series populating the British capital with animals, starting with a goat revealed last week on Monday, followed by two elephants the next day and then monkeys, a wolf, pelicans, a cat, piranhas and a rhinoceros in subsequent days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The frequency of artworks is unusual for Banksy – whose identity is publicly unknown – and who usually spaces out his pieces over months, leaving fans speculating about the meaning of the different animals and awaiting a "big" reveal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest mural was "an absolute shock and surprise to all of us here at London Zoo," Karl Penman, commercial operations manager at the zoo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If it is the full stop, what a great full stop to end on," Penman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC reported the that piece was the last in the series.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can see the watchful eyes, which to me look a little bit uncertain about whether they want to be free," said doctor Sharmela Darne about the eyes of animals staring from behind the shutter in the latest artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the seal's clearly going away and so are the birds flying free... so maybe it's about freedom and being unsure about freedom," said Darne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For many, the animal safari has added some positivity to their week, as the country reeled following the death of three girls in a stabbing and ensuing violent riots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in front of two pelicans painted over a fish shop in Walthamstow, northeast London, Peter McCarthy said it had been "very nice to have it in this particular week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Very nice that he's been around the country when there's been such trouble. Doing these wonderful things."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For others, the choice of animals has meaning, with some finding the goat similar to a Palestinian mountain gazelle and others pointing out the artist's previous work on the climate crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three of the artworks have already been removed or stolen, and the rhino revealed on Monday was defaced the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A satellite dish painted with the wolf was stolen within hours of being claimed by Banksy, with the cat on a billboard removed by contractors and a police box painted with swimming piranhas removed by the local authority to ensure it was "properly protected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in front of the cat on Saturday before it was removed, dentist Mitul Patel said he wished "people would leave his work alone so that other people could enjoy it as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locals and tourists alike have been enjoying the artworks that are still up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taking a brief pause from his job, construction worker Owen said the three monkeys in east London's Shoreditch area were "very exciting" and a "big talking point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Mazur, a photographer visiting from the US, said he had been "running around photographing all" the artworks, and was "bummed" about having to return to New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retiree Don Gould lives around the corner from the goat in southwest London's Kew Green, and saw the artwork after it was revealed online last week. "It's a very good excuse for a stroll on the green and a pint, isn't it?" (AFP)

    US car workers union files charges against Trump, Musk

    <![CDATA[<img alt="During their live-streamed conversation on X, Donald Trump heaped praise on Elon Musk for his history of firing employees at the drop of a hat. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766067_1_20240814025737.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A major US car workers union filed federal labour charges on Tuesday against Donald Trump and Elon Musk, accusing the billionaires of illegally intimidating workers during a rambling and highly publicised conversation on X.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Republican presidential hopeful and Musk, who has endorsed him, exchanged a checklist of radical conspiracy theories as they chatted on the social network on Monday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one point the conversation veered into Musk's time at the helm of his multiple companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I mean, I look at what you do," Trump said to Musk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You walk in, you say, 'You want to quit?' They go on strike," Trump said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That's OK, you're all gone. You're all gone. So, every one of you is gone.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk carried out massive layoffs after his acquisition of Twitter (now X) was finalised in October 2022, and he announced in April the dismissal of more than 10 percent of Tesla's global workforce, amounting to at least 14,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labour Relations Act," said the United Auto Workers (UAW), which has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris after previously backing Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean. When we say Trump stands against everything our union stands for, this is what we mean," said UAW President Shawn Fain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both Trump and Musk want working class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly," Fain said. "It's disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk owns the social network X, SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, among other companies. He has been criticised in the past for obstructing the unionisation of his employees around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla has been at odds with unions in Sweden and Norway for a few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several complaints have also been filed in California by former SpaceX workers who say employees who tried to protest job conditions were retaliated against. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from several Muslim countries, as well as the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766064_1_20240814022139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A far-right Israeli minister prayed with thousands of Jews at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem on Tuesday, defying a ban on Jewish prayer at the flashpoint site and drawing global condemnation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who has often ignored the Israeli government's longstanding ban, vowed to "defeat Hamas" in Gaza in a video he filmed during his visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The compound is Islam's third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity, but it is also Judaism's holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit comes at a tense time during the 10-month Israel-Hamas war, with faltering efforts for a ceasefire and Israel braced for threatened attacks from Iran and its proxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir's latest visit drew sharp condemnation from both Muslim countries as well as Western powers, including the United States, the European Union and the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not only is it unacceptable, it detracts from what we think is a vital time, as we are working to get this ceasefire deal across the finish line," US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years, the restrictions have been increasingly flouted by hardline religious nationalists like Ben Gvir, prompting sometimes violent reactions from Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday morning, he and some 2,250 other Israelis walked through the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns, under the protection of Israeli police, said an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is custodian of the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli police also "imposed restrictions" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said, adding that more than 700 Jews also prayed there in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque, is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa Mosque," the official said on condition of anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry condemned the "storming" of the mosque, calling it a "flagrant violation of international law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The continual violations of the historical and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its sanctities require a clear and firm international position that condemns these violations," ministry spokesperson Sufyan al-Qudah said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group of Muslim-majority states, "strongly condemned" the incident and said it was a "provocation to the feelings of Muslims all over the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the UN was "against any efforts to change the status quo within the holy sites."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This sort of behaviour is unhelpful and it is unduly provocative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on X that the bloc "strongly condemns the provocations" by Ben Gvir.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images posted on social media networks showed Ben Gvir inside the compound while several Israelis lay on the ground performing Talmudic rituals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ben Gvir released a video statement on X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, renewing his opposition to any truce in the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo," he said, referring to the US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza set to resume on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can defeat Hamas... we must bring them down to their knees," Ben Gvir said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's entry into the Al-Aqsa compound comes on the Jewish mourning day of Tisha Be'Av that commemorates the destruction of the ancient temple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month too, Ben Gvir, who is known for provocative gestures, said he had prayed inside the Al-Aqsa mosque compound. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man appeared in a London court on Tuesday charged with attempted murder after an 11-year-old girl was stabbed in one of the capital's busiest tourist areas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ioan Pintaru, 32, appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court, which heard that he was a Romanian citizen with no fixed address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The girl was with her mother when she was attacked in Leicester Square on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said Pintaru had "approached the girl, placed her into a headlock, he's then stabbed her eight times to the body."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was taken to hospital with serious but not life threatening injuries. She was wounded in the face, shoulder, wrist and neck area, the prosecutor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have said they do not believe that the suspect knew the girl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pintaru was remanded in custody to appear in court again on September 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack outside top brand stores in the central London square came two weeks after a mass stabbing in Southport, northwest England, in which three girls were killed and eight children and two adults wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack sparked riots across England, after rumours spread online that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in India on Tuesday said hospital services were disrupted in several Indian cities after a doctors' protest spread nationwide following the rape and murder of a trainee medic in the city of Kolkata.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of doctors marched on Monday in Kolkata and the surrounding West Bengal state to denounce the killing at a government-run hospital, demanding justice for the victim and better security measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31-year-old doctor was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests spread on Tuesday, with more than 8,000 government doctors in the western Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, halting work in all hospital departments except emergency services, media said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the capital, New Delhi, junior doctors wearing white coats held posters that read, "Doctors are not punching bags," as they sat in protest outside a large government hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar protests in cities such as Lucknow, capital of the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, and in the western tourist resort state of Goa hit some hospital services, media said. (Reuters)

    Africa health body warns over mpox spread

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The African Union's health watchdog on Tuesday declared a public health emergency over the growing mpox outbreak on the continent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766050_1_20240813221254.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Africa's top public health body declared what it termed a "public health emergency of continental security" on Tuesday over an outbreak of mpox that spread from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighbouring countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I declare with a heavy heart but with an unyielding commitment to our people, to our African citizens, we declare mpox as public health emergency of continental security," Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), said during an online media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox is transmitted through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. Most cases are mild but it can kill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as Clade I.
  <br/>
  But the new variant, known as Clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, particularly among children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Africa CDC warned last week the viral infection's rate of spread was alarming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that more than 15,000 mpox cases and 461 deaths were reported on the continent this year so far, representing a 160 percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mpox has been endemic in parts of Africa for decades after it was first detected in human in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A milder version of the virus spread to over 100 countries in 2022, largely through sexual contact, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WHO ended the emergency 10 months later, saying the health crisis had come under control. (Reuters)

    Hong Kong dessert chain rides the French wave

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Xu Xiaofeng, the owner of the Paris Hui Lau Shan business, prepares the shop's signature mango drink. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765966_1_20240813105944.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A nostalgic Hong Kong mango sago chain is thriving in one of the most unexpected places – Paris, showing that sweet treats can transcend boundaries, cultures and languages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hui Lau Shan – a household name for classic Chinese desserts and herbal tea, and famous for its icy mango beverages and desserts – had been a fixture on the streets of Hong Kong since the 1960s, until the last franchised store in the SAR closed in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, it is flourishing in the French capital because of a die-hard fan. Xu Xiaofeng brought the franchise to Paris after he developed a love affair with its fruity drinks when he was extremely thirsty one day during a Hong Kong work trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But becoming the owner of the Parisian Hui Lau Shan business was not easy. Xu said it took him three tries to convince the owners to grant him permission to expand the brand in France, where Xu had been an exchange student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the conditions was that he needed to stay true to Hui Lau Shan’s original taste, with the owners sending inspectors to ensure that the taste of the Paris branch matched that of the original back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Europe, people really love eating mangos,” a beaming Xu, wearing an apron and a red baseball cap emblazoned with the brand's logo told RTHK, as he prepared a signature drink by cutting up the fruit and putting it into a food blender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Basically, if there are more than ten tonnes of mangoes a year, Paris would consume more than half of them, so I know there is a good market here,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “First, they love mangoes very much, and second, many strive for healthy foods, so it was the perfect combination.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu said his dessert shops first attracted Chinese customers living in France, but over time, he also won over the French, who he said did have one complaint – that his desserts were not sweet enough compared to local pastries and tarts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To address this, Xu decided to start blending elements from both cultures to bring the two culinary worlds together.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think this is an exchange between desserts. For example, our pancakes use French cheese, cream and French Chantilly. This is a good blend. Now, French people are slowly starting to use a lot of fresh fruits to make their own desserts, which I think is a good exchange,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are able to learn from each other. Our desserts aren’t too sweet, but theirs are. With exchange, we can meet in the middle and create something new together.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 The armed wing of Palestinian group Hamas said on Monday its militants had shot and killed an Israeli hostage and wounded two others, both women, in two separate incidents in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages during their October 7 attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, with 111 of them still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement: "In two separate incidents, two recruits assigned to guard enemy prisoners fired at a Zionist prisoner, killing him immediately, and also injured two female prisoners critically."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement, posted on Telegram, did not identify the hostages or say when or where the incidents occurred, but noted "attempts are being made to save the lives" of the two women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Obeida said Hamas had formed a committee to investigate the shootings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that it does "not have any intelligence information that allows us to refute or confirm Hamas' claims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to examine and verify the credibility of the message," the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, in a televised briefing earlier on Monday, said: "We do not forget for a moment the hostages being cruelly held by Hamas in Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are deeply concerned about their physical and mental condition, given the prolonged time that has passed and the harsh conditions of their captivity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in the Gaza Strip since then has killed at least 39,897 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukrainian troops who have crossed the border into its territory will be "dislodged." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765928_1_20240813023744.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his army on Monday to "dislodge" Ukrainian troops who have entered Russian territory as authorities said over 120,000 people had been evacuated away from the fighting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv launched a surprise offensive into Russia's western Kursk region last Tuesday, capturing over two dozen settlements in the most significant cross-border attack on Russian soil since World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's military chief Oleksandr Syrsky told President Volodymyr Zelensky in a video posted on Monday that his troops now control about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory and are continuing "offensive operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin told a televised meeting with government officials that "one of the obvious goals of the enemy is to sow discord" and "destroy the unity and cohesion of Russian society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main task is, of course, for the defence ministry to dislodge the enemy from our territories," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky told the nation in his evening address that the cross-border offensive was "purely a security issue," capturing "areas from which the Russia army struck at our Sumy region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 121,000 people have fled the Kursk region since the start of the fighting, which has killed at least 12 civilians and injured 121 more, regional governor Alexei Smirnov told the meeting with Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Kursk announced on Monday they were widening their evacuation area to include a district with some 14,000 residents. The neighbouring Belgorod region also said it was evacuating a new border district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has pierced into the region by at least 12 kilometres and has captured 28 towns and villages, with the new front 40 kilometres long, Smirnov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Syrsky said that "as of now, about 1,000 square kilometres of Russian territory are under control," suggesting the area captured is more than twice as large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that fighting was ongoing along almost the whole front and "the situation is under our control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said Russia would respond by showing "unanimous support for all those in distress" and claimed there had been an increase in men signing up to fight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enemy will receive a worthy riposte," he said. (AFP)

    Indonesia president holds meeting in future capital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The future presidential palace, still under construction, is due to host Indonesia's 79th Independence Day celebration on August 17. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765925_1_20240813012725.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Monday held his first cabinet meeting in the country's future capital, despite much of the city remaining under construction as it runs behind schedule.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US$32-billion megaproject Nusantara was widely expected to be inaugurated on August 17, Indonesia's Independence Day, but building delays and funding woes have cast doubt on the schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, still hailed the city-in-progress, which is expected to be fully ready in 2045.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Not all countries have the opportunity, have the ability to build their capital starting from zero," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Jokowi, the city is "being built with the concept of a forest city, a jungle city, a city full of green" in eastern Borneo island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But environmentalists have warned the rapid development of the new capital will hasten deforestation in one of the world's largest stretches of tropical rainforest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokowi – who started to work from the future capital several weeks ago – brought dozens of officials to Nusantara for the cabinet meeting, including his successor Prabowo Subianto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo pledged to continue the capital-to-be once he takes office in October, removing any doubt over his willingness to carry out Jokowi's legacy project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jokowi resurrected the long-shelved plan to relocate the capital soon after taking office in 2019 after experts warned Jakarta – the megacity of 12 million people – was sinking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An official decree on moving the capital from Jakarta could be delayed until after Prabowo takes office, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have said many times that I am determined to continue, if possible, to complete the project," said Prabowo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe in three, four, five years, the capital city can function."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ground broke on several projects on Monday, including the vice presidential palace and several private buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nusantara has struggled to attract crucial foreign investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jakarta will fund 20 percent of Nusantara and hopes to secure 100 trillion rupiah (US$6.13 billion) in private investment by the end of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as of Monday, Jokowi said it had received only 56.2 trillion rupiah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government aims to have 1.9 million people living in Nusantara by 2045. (AFP)

    Athens suburbs on fire as Greece calls on EU for help

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive wildfire blazed its way into Athens' northeastern suburbs on Monday as hundreds of firefighters battled to contain it, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes and sparking a Greek government appeal for international help.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In scenes never before seen in the Greek capital, residents wearing masks against the choking smoke were desperately dousing their homes with water hoses in the leafy suburbs of Nea Penteli and Vrilissia in an effort to render them less vulnerable to fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television footage showed several cars in both areas gutted by fire and the roofs of stately homes burning as water-bombing helicopters roared overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation is dramatic," Penteli mayor Natassa Kosmopoulou told news portal newsit.gr.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A school and homes are on fire, and I can see the fire coming towards the town hall," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece on Monday formally called for EU assistance, a spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU civil protection mechanism was activated upon request of the Greek authorities," EU spokesman Balazs Ujvari said in a statement, adding that Italy, France, the Czech Republic and Romania were sending units to help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Paris was sending 180 firefighters, 55 trucks and a helicopter to assist their hard-pressed Greek colleagues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wildfire started on Sunday afternoon in the town of Varnavas, some 35 kilometres northeast of Athens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aided by strong winds, it grew to a 30-kilometre long frontline of fires, more than 25 metres high in places, according to state TV ERT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 700 firefighters with 190 fire engines and over 30 aircraft sought to contain it, but it scaled Mount Pentelicon, which looms over the Greek capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several large Athens municipalities ordered partial evacuations, including Penteli, Vrilissia and Halandri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of the direction of the wind we have decided on a precautionary evacuation," Halandri mayor Simos Roussos told ERT. "The fire is very close."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities opened the Olympic stadium in northern Athens and other stadiums to house thousands of people evacuated from the path of the blaze. Three major hospitals have been placed on standby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One firefighter suffered serious burns, another was hospitalised with breathing trouble and 13 other people were treated for milder respiratory problems, fire brigade spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several smaller communities and towns, including Marathon, which gave the Olympic long distance race its name, started to evacuate on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are facing a biblical catastrophe," said Marathon's mayor Stergios Tsirkas. "Our whole town is engulfed in flames," he told the Skai television channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoke drifted through central Athens as thick grey clouds engulfed Mount Pentelikon, which is known for producing the marble used in the Acropolis and other ancient buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civil protection forces battled hard throughout the night, but despite superhuman efforts, the fire evolved rapidly," Vathrakogiannis said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wind had rekindled the fire in 40 different locations on Monday, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A children's hospital and a military medical facility in Penteli were evacuated at dawn, Vathrakogiannis said. Another hospital was evacuated during the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The destruction revived memories of the Mati disaster, the coastal area near Marathon where 104 people died in July 2018 in a tragedy later blamed on evacuation delays and errors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summer wildfire season in Greece this year has seen dozens of daily blazes after the Mediterranean country recorded its warmest winter and the hottest June and July since reliable data collection began in 1960.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures around Athens were forecast to peak at 39 degrees Celsius on Monday, with wind gusts of up to 50 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Forest fire near you. Follow the instructions of the authorities," said SMS messages sent to people in the Attica region, indicating in which direction to flee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias issued a warning on Saturday that half the country faced a high risk of fires due to high temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday he said that a fire that broke out on Sunday near the town of Varnavas had spread even though a water-bombing aircraft reached the area within five minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're working 24-hour shifts, all of us," said fireman Marinos Peristeropoulos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fire spread very quickly because of the strong wind," he said near one of the hotspots in Grammatiko.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other parts of Europe are also struggling with high temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of France rose above 40 Celsius on Sunday. In Rome, temperatures were expected to reach 38 Celsius Monday and remain around 36 Celsius this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, temperatures between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius are expected. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday urged all sides in the Ukraine war to de-escalate as Kyiv's forces pierced deep into Russia's Kursk border region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault seemed to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army on Sunday appearing to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the offensive, Beijing on Monday urged all parties to follow "three principles for de-escalating the situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those are "no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fuelling the flame by any party", the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China will continue to maintain communication with the international community and play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the crisis," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing released a paper last year calling for a political settlement to the conflict. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Just opposite the fencing stadium, the Grand Palais on the Avenue des Champs Élysées, scores of tourists have been queuing up outside the largest Olympic merchandise store to take home a taste of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Paris 2024 megastore offers a variety of souvenirs, from 5 euro pens and bracelets, to giant mascots costing 800 euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekday visitors have had to wait around 15 minutes to get inside the store, but most RTHK spoke to said it was worth queuing up for.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adam, a UK tourist in Paris with his kids, bought a T-shirt, a hat, a poster and some badges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We spent about 110 euros, which I think, as it's only every four years, it's something to remember the Games by, so I think it's okay every once in a while,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympic mascot “Phryge”, a little red hat symbolising French liberty, is one of the bestsellers at the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douglas from Hong Kong bought one because he wanted something special to take home with him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s unique and it's like representing the culture and France and also it represents the spirit of the Olympics, so we're trying to look for something very unique for a gift,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to the French capital can also take home the smell of a fresh baguette, with the launch of scratch-and-sniff stamps by the French postal service La Poste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's to celebrate the baguette, which is one of the symbols of France for the tourists for them to enjoy and to share this with the people they live with abroad,” said Gaspard, a worker at the Olympic Village’s post office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The French baguette was given Unesco heritage status in 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris said a triumphant "au revoir" to the Olympics on Sunday as the curtain came down on its widely praised staging of the global sporting spectacular.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A star-studded closing ceremony took place in front of around 71,500 spectators at the Stade de France to crown an event that has been broadly acclaimed as one of the greatest editions of the Olympics ever held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 270 artists performed in the packed arena for an estimated 9,000 athletes who marched into the venue as the festivities got into full swing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening segment of the ceremony festivities began with France's swimming hero Leon Marchand -- winner of four gold medals at these Games -- gathering the Olympic flame from the cauldron in the centre of Paris to begin its journey to the Stade de France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rugby hero Antoine Dupont -- who led the host nation to a rugby sevens gold medal in one of the early highlights of the Games -- carried a tricolore flag into the Stade de France as partying athletes swarmed the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The show included a theatrical sequence entitled "Records", which was a dream-like immersive journey through time, led by a "Golden Voyager".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musicians Phoenix then entertained the crowd with a series of hits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach hailed the Paris Games as "sensational".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These were sensational Olympic Games from start to finish - or dare I say, Seine-sational Games," Bach said in a speech at the closing ceremony, in a reference to the river which staged the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The closing spectacle marked the beginning of the four-year countdown to the Los Angeles Olympics, and American gymnastics icon Simone Biles joined Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass as the Olympic flag was formally handed to the Californian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then it was time for Hollywood's top gun Tom Cruise to jump from the roof of the Stade de France into the closing ceremony before speeding off with the Olympic flag in a dramatic handover that began the anticipation for the Games in 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A beaming Cruise high-fived athletes after making the roughly 160-foot descent before jumping on a motorcycle and exiting the stadium as the crowd at the 80,000-seat stadium roared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Living up to the stunning success of the Paris Games may seem like mission impossible for LA and the celebrity-rich city will lean on its stars such as leading man Cruise as the Olympic spotlight turns to Southern California.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise was among the many celebrities seen taking in the action at the Paris Games, showing up at gymnastics, swimming and soccer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, Yseult, a French R&B singer, performed "Comme d’habitude," the song famously adapted into "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lights dimmed as she serenaded the stadium before fireworks lit up the sky to conclude Paris 2024. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nineteen people including five children are confirmed dead after a landslide at a huge garbage dump in the Ugandan capital Kampala, a senior official said on Sunday, amid claims the site was a disaster waiting to happen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local media said homes, people and livestock were buried in mountains of waste at the landfill in the northern Kampala district of Kiteezi on Saturday after a collapse caused by heavy downpours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Yoweri Museveni said he had directed the army's special forces to help in the search and rescue operation and demanded to know who allowed people to live near such a "potentially hazardous and dangerous heap."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area's resident commissioner Yasin Ndide said after visiting the scene of the disaster that the death toll was now 19, including five children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rescue mission is ongoing but with little hope of finding more survivors," he said, adding that local authorities were setting up temporary shelters for those affected by the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndide blamed the "encroachment" of local people who had breached the perimeter fence and settled on the site for the loss of life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala's metropolitan police spokesman Patrick Onyango had earlier told reporters at the scene that 14 bodies had been recovered on Saturday, and another four on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Onyango also said that 14 people had been rescued, while an estimated 1,000 were displaced and that the police were working with other government agencies and community leaders to see how to help those affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala mayor Erias Lukwago said that "many, many more could be still buried in the heap as the rescue operation is ongoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described it as a "national disaster," blaming corrupt officials who he said had been syphoning off money that should have been used to maintain the landfill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Museveni said in a statement posted on X that he had ordered payments to the victims' families of five million Ugandan shillings (US$1,300) for each fatality and one million shillings (US$270) for each injured person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for an investigation into how people were allowed to live so close to the site and ordered the removal of all those living in the "danger zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excavators were still churning through huge mounds of rubbish on Sunday as crowds of local residents looked on, some wailing in despair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukwago had on Saturday raised concerns about the safety of the 36-acre (14-hectare) landfill which was established in 1996 and takes in almost all garbage collected across Kampala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a disaster and was bound to happen as the landfill was full to capacity," he said, adding that it received about 1,500 tonnes of waste a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, Lukwago had warned that people working and living near the site were at risk of numerous health hazards due to overflowing waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several areas in Uganda and other parts of East Africa have been battered by heavy rains recently, including Ethiopia, the second most populous country on the continent. (AFP)

    Hamas tells Gaza mediators to go with Biden truce plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People inspect the damage in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood after it was destroyed by Israeli bombs on Sunday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765795_1_20240812034601.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday called on US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators to implement a ceasefire plan for Gaza put forward by US President Joe Biden, instead of holding "more negotiations."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas "demands that the mediators present a plan to implement what they proposed to the movement... based on Biden's vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and compel the occupation (Israel) to comply, rather than going through more negotiation rounds or new proposals," the Palestinian group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators have invited both Israel and Hamas for a round of negotiations on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, shortly after the killing of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Israel agreed to a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks to facilitate the release of hostages still held in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the killing of Haniyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several rounds of negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza have failed until now, except for a one-week truce that was observed at the end of November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That truce saw the release of scores of hostages in exchange of dozens of Palestinians prisoners who were held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On May 31, Biden unveiled what he said was a three-stage plan for a ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plan includes a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks, with Israeli forces withdrawing from "all populated areas of Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "a number" of hostages captured in the October 7 attacks, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The remains of some hostages who had been killed would also be returned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their "homes and neighbourhoods" throughout Gaza, including in the north, which has been devastated by months of Israeli bombing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the initial six-week period, Israel and Hamas would "negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceasefire would also be extended if the negotiations continue, with mediators working to ensure they continue, Biden said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In phase two, also lasting around another six weeks, Israeli forces would completely withdraw from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "all remaining living hostages" including male Israeli soldiers. This has been a key sticking point for Hamas in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If both sides keep to the deal it will lead to the "cessation of hostilities permanently," Biden said, quoting what he said had been an Israeli proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the third and final stage, a major reconstruction and stabilisation plan for Gaza would begin, backed by the US and the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 Hamas attacks resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,790 people, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    Russia concedes Ukraine advances in Kursk offensive

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765791_1_20240812023140.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday acknowledged Ukrainian forces had pierced deep into the Kursk border region in an offensive that a top official in Ukraine said was aimed to "destabilise" Russia and "stretch" its armed forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border," the security official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock assault, now in its sixth day, appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army rushing in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash the incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But its army on Sunday appeared to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a daily briefing on the situation in the western Kursk region, the defence ministry said it had "foiled attempts" by Ukraine's forces to "break through deep into Russian territory" using armoured vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said some of those forces were located near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian official also said Russia's claims that Kyiv had deployed 1,000 troops were a serious underestimation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a lot more... Thousands," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After days of official silence, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the offensive for the first time in his nightly address on Saturday, saying that Kyiv was "pushing the war into the aggressor's territory."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022 and has waged an unrelenting campaign, occupying swathes of the east and south and subjecting Ukrainian cities to daily missile and drone attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After re-capturing large areas in 2022, Kyiv has largely been on the back foot, increasingly struggling with manpower and arms supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault on Russia's western Kursk region has been the largest and most successful cross-border offensive by Kyiv so far – and the most significant attack by a foreign army on Russian territory since the Second World War.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has used air power, artillery fire and drones in a bid to quash the advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said on Saturday that more than 76,000 civilians had been evacuated from border areas, with more leaving on Sunday. (AFP)

    Two migrants die trying to cross Channel to Britain

    <![CDATA[<img alt="So far this year 25 migrants have died trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765786_1_20240812001833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new drownings near the French city of Calais mean nine people have lost their life attempting the dangerous sea crossing this month alone, and 25 since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boat was signalled as being in distress on Sunday morning at sea between Calais and Dunkirk and "two people were declared dead," the maritime authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel in trouble 10 kilometres north of Calais had 56 migrants on board, said Jacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the 54 surviving passengers, and another 50 people from another boat who were rescued, five were receiving medical care, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, 12 migrants had died at sea trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain, according to the French authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death toll this year has already surpassed that, with 25 migrants who have lost their lives since January, Billant said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said those crossing the sea often did so "without a lifejacket," on "vessels of very poor quality because not inflated enough and often without a solid bottom... or decent engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-governmental organisation called L'Auberge des Migrants ("The migrant hostel") on X mourned the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This border kills in the greatest of silences," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of August 8, 17,639 people had crossed the sea on so-called "small boats" to Britain this year, according to a tally of British government figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That is very close to the figure for the same period in 2022, a year of record crossings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Labour party's victory in the British general election in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has cancelled a plan by the former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to crack down on the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Billant said more than 350 people have been arrested and 15 "smuggler networks" dismantled since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new migrant deaths come as the United Kingdom has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the United Kingdom on Saturday against the riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration. (AFP)

    In TV interview, Biden brands Trump a 'danger' to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden made the claim in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765781_1_20240811234132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since dropping out of the White House race, warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Mark my words, if he wins... this election, watch what happens," Biden told CBS News in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's a genuine danger to American security. Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since withdrawing after his flailing debate performance against Trump underlined fears about his age and mental abilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week, he appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining his exit, he said other Democratic Party politicians standing for re-election feared he would damage their chances – and added that his only priority was to stop Trump from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A critical issue for me still is – not a joke – maintaining this democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is – we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery – and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.
  <br/>

  Biden's age had come to dominate the 2024 campaign, and the Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since his exit, as Harris has enjoyed a surge in support that has left Trump struggling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to stay on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth, but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.

  Trump's light campaign schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, JD Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about white supremacist attacks on his family, child care, asylum seekers and abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash. (AFP)
