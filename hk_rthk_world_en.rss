<div class="itemFullText">
 The US State Department on Wednesday renewed its allegation that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange put people at risk for revealing secrets, after he was freed in a plea deal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The documents they published gave identifying information of individuals who were in contact with the State Department – that included opposition leaders, human rights activists around the world – whose positions were put in some danger because of their public disclosure," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also chilled the ability of American personnel to build relationships and have frank conversations," Miller said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange had published hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents on the WikiLeaks whistleblowing website from 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian agreed to plea guilty to a single count of conspiracy to obtain and disseminate national defence information and was sentenced to the time he had served in London – five years and two months – and given his liberty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange has become a hero for activists who point to his role in divulging information about the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but critics fault him for putting out vast quantities of government documents without any filtering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miller said that the State Department at the time "had to scramble to get people out of danger, to move them out of harm's way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pressed on whether anyone was harmed in the end, Miller said, "If you drive drunk down the street and get pulled over for drunk driving, the fact that you didn't crash into another car and kill someone doesn't get you out of the reckless actions and the endangerment that you put your fellow citizens in."

    Nato names Dutch PM Rutte as next boss

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759184_1_20240626233925.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato's 32 nations on Wednesday appointed outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the alliance's next chief, handing him the job at a crucial moment with Russia on the march in Ukraine and US elections looming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rutte will take over from Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on October 1 after major powers – spearheaded by the United States – agreed on his nomination ahead of a summit of Nato leaders in Washington next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mark is a true transatlanticist, a strong leader and a consensus-builder," Stoltenberg said on social media after Nato ambassadors approved the appointment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know I am leaving Nato in good hands," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte said it was a "tremendous honour" to take over from Stoltenberg once his decade at the helm of Nato ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The alliance is and will remain the cornerstone of our collective security. Leading this organisation is a responsibility I do not take lightly," he posted online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seasoned Dutch leader, whose 14-year tenure leading the Netherlands is set to end within weeks, is seen as a safe pair of hands capable of stewarding Nato through perilous times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His appointment was welcomed by leaders across the 75-year-old alliance, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who called it "a good choice for freedom and security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said US President Joe Biden believed Rutte "will make an excellent secretary general."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the 57-year-old faces the possibility of a possible return by former US president Donald Trump to the White House, who has long criticised the alliance, Rutte will also have to grapple with the threat posed by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After staking a claim for the Nato post following the collapse of his Dutch coalition government last year, Rutte had to use all his diplomatic skills to win over reluctant allies Turkey and Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He finally clinched the race last week when his sole challenger, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, dropped out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A staunch supporter of Ukraine, the straight-talking Dutchman has spearheaded a push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets to help beat back Russia's assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Nato chief he will play a key role in marshalling allies to keep backing the war-torn country – while treading a fine line over Kyiv's push to join the alliance. (AFP)

    Kenya's Ruto says finance bill to be withdrawn

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tuesday's protests led to the deaths of more than 20 people. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759183_1_20240626233246.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenyan President William Ruto said on Wednesday that a bill containing contentious tax hikes would "be withdrawn," dramatically reversing course after more than 20 people died and parliament was ransacked by protesters opposed to the legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But he warned that the withdrawal of the finance bill would mean a significant shortfall in funding for development programmes designed to help farmers and schoolteachers, among others, as the East African nation struggles to lower its foreign debt burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I concede and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill and it shall subsequently be withdrawn," Ruto told a press briefing, adding: "The people have spoken."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto's administration has been taken by surprise by the intensity of opposition to its tax hikes, with protests breaking out across the country last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largely peaceful rallies turned violent on Tuesday when lawmakers passed the legislation and police fired live rounds into crowds that ransacked the partly ablaze parliament complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it had recorded 22 deaths and 300 injured victims, adding that they would launch an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Frustration over the rising cost of living spiralled last week as lawmakers began debating the bill containing the tax hikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto's cash-strapped government said the increases were needed to service the country's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings (US$78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of Kenya's GDP. (AFP)

    N Korea trash balloons disrupt Incheon Airport

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Takeoff and landing at South Korea's Incheon international airport was disrupted on Wednesday for about three hours before dawn because of balloons launched by North Korea filled with refuse, an airport spokesperson said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One balloon landed on the tarmac near passenger Terminal 2 and the three runways at Incheon were temporarily shut down, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has flown balloons carrying trash into South Korea since late May, with hundreds landing in South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several balloons were spotted in and around the airport boundaries, the spokesperson said, adding that this was not the first time operations at the airport – which is about 40km from the North Korean border – had been disrupted by balloons nearby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disruption to domestic and international flights occurred between 1.46am and 4.44am, and the runways have re-opened since then, Incheon International Airport Corporation said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has said the balloons are retaliation for a propaganda campaign by North Korean defectors and activists in the South who regularly send over balloons carrying food, medicine, money and leaflets criticising the North's leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the items carried by the North Korean balloons have been articles printed with Hello Kitty characters, badly worn clothing, and soil containing traces of human faeces and parasites, South Korea has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, North Korea test-fired what appeared to be a hypersonic missile off its east coast on Wednesday, but it exploded in midair, South Korea's military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The missile was launched from near the capital, Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Japan's Defence Ministry said the missile flew to an altitude of about 100km and range of more than 200km. (Reuters)

    Assange leaves US court after plea accepted

<div class="itemFullText">
 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange left a US court in Saipan where he was freed in a landmark plea deal on Wednesday, but did not address reporters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 52-year-old was seen leaving the court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a Pacific US territory, by car. He will now fly to Canberra in his native Australia, WikiLeaks said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His lawyer Jen Robinson hailed Wednesday as a "historic day" after Assange was freed by the US court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a historic day. It brings to an end 14 years of legal battles," she told reporters outside the court in Saipan. "It also brings to an end a case which has been recognised as the greatest threat to the First Amendment in the 21st century."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The WikiLeaks founder has long been wanted by Washington for revealing military secrets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the three-hour hearing, Assange pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents but said he had believed the US Constitution's First Amendment, which protects free speech, shielded his activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Working as a journalist I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information," he told the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believed the First Amendment protected that activity but I accept that it was ... a violation of the espionage statute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief US District Judge Ramona V Manglona accepted his guilty plea and released him due to time already served in a British jail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With this pronouncement, it appears that you will be able to walk out of this courtroom a free man," she said. (AFP/Reuters)

    US gun violence declared a 'public health crisis'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US surgeon general on Tuesday issued a landmark advisory declaring gun violence a "public health crisis" and calling for wide-ranging firearm controls that have historically been quashed by stiff political opposition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advisory by Vivek Murthy, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, is the first such major report on gun violence from a surgeon general, whose office has limited authority but plays a significant public role in health issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A similar report on tobacco in the 1960s was a key first step to altering the perception of the substance's danger, ultimately leading to new regulations and a steep decline in consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firearm violence is an urgent public health crisis that has led to loss of life, unimaginable pain, and profound grief for far too many Americans," Murthy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't have to continue down this path, and we don't have to subject our children to the ongoing horror of firearm violence in America."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report cites government and other data that shows the United States is an extreme outlier on deaths and injuries from guns, especially for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firearms in recent years have become the leading cause of deaths for Americans aged 1-19, above motor vehicles, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the influential NRA gun rights organisation quickly slammed the advisory as "an extension of the Biden Administration's war on law-abiding gun owners."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "America has a crime problem caused by criminals," said Randy Kozuch, director the NRA's lobby arm, said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surgeon general's report said in 2022 over 48,000 people died as a result of firearms, disproportionately affecting black Americans and men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that suicides had increased by 20.1 percent from 2012-2022 and represented over half of gun-related deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will take the collective commitment of our nation to turn the tide on firearm violence," Murthy said, calling for investments in research, community education programmes, mental health support and tighter controls on buying guns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report also calls for mandating safe firearm storage, implementing universal background checks and banning assault weapons. (AFP)

    Five shot dead as violent protests escalate in Kenya

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police opened fire on demonstrators trying to storm Kenya's legislature on Tuesday, with at least five protesters killed, dozens wounded and sections of the parliament building set ablaze as lawmakers inside passed legislation to raise taxes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In chaotic scenes, protesters overwhelmed police and chased them away in an attempt to storm the parliament compound, with Citizen TV reporting protesters had managed to enter the Senate chamber earlier in the day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police opened fire after tear gas and water cannon failed to disperse the crowds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One eyewitness counted the bodies of at least five protesters outside parliament. A paramedic, Vivian Achista, said at least 10 had been shot dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another paramedic, Richard Ngumo, said more than 50 people had been wounded by gunfire. He was lifting two injured protesters into an ambulance outside parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to shut down parliament and every MP should go down and resign," protester Davis Tafari, who was trying to enter parliament, said. "We will have a new government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenyan activist Auma Obama, the half-sister of former US President Barack Obama, was among protesters tear-gassed during the demonstrations, a CNN interview showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police eventually managed to drive the protesters from the building amid clouds of tear gas and the sound of gunfire. The lawmakers were evacuated through underground tunnels, local media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Internet services across the country also experienced severe disruptions during the police crackdown, internet monitor Netblocks said. Kenya's leading network operator Safaricom said two undersea cables were out of action, causing the outages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests and clashes also took place in several other cities and towns across the country, with many calling for President William Ruto to quit office as well as voicing their opposition to the tax rises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament approved the finance bill, moving it through to a third reading by lawmakers. The next step is for the legislation to be sent to the president for signing. He can send it back to parliament if he has any objections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto won an election almost two years ago on a platform of championing Kenya's working poor, but has been caught between the competing demands of lenders such as the International Monetary Fund, which is urging the government to cut deficits to obtain more funding, and a hard-pressed population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenyans have been struggling to cope with several economic shocks caused by the lingering impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, two consecutive years of droughts and depreciation of the currency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance bill aims to raise an additional US$2.7 billion in taxes as part of an effort to lighten the heavy debt load, with interest payments alone consuming 37 percent of annual revenue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposition leader Raila Odinga called for the Finance Bill to be immediately and unconditionally withdrawn to make way for dialogue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am disturbed at the murders, arrests, detentions and surveillance being perpetrated by police on boys and girls who are only seeking to be heard over taxation policies that are stealing both their present and future," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has already made some concessions, promising to scrap proposed new taxes on bread, cooking oil, car ownership and financial transactions. But that has not been enough to satisfy protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tuesday's protests began in a festival-like atmosphere but as crowds swelled, police fired tear gas in Nairobi's Central Business District and the poor neighbourhood of Kibera. Protesters ducked for cover and threw stones at police lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People clambered over police vehicles stalled in the downtown streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also fired tear gas in Eldoret, Ruto's hometown in western Kenya, where crowds of protesters filled the streets and many businesses were closed for fear of violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clashes also broke out in the coastal city of Mombasa and demonstrations took place in Kisumu, on Lake Victoria, and Garissa in eastern Kenya, where police blocked the main road to Somalia's port of Kismayu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Nairobi, people chanted "Ruto must go" and crowds sang in Swahili: "All can be possible without Ruto." Music played from loudspeakers and protesters waved Kenyan flags and blew whistles in the few hours before the violence escalated. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato will officially name outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the alliance's next head on Wednesday, after ambassadors from all 32 member countries greenlit his appointment, diplomats said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Diplomats from several Nato states said Rutte, who was strongly backed by leading power the United States, will take over from current secretary general Jens Stoltenberg when his term ends on October 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte, 57, last week sealed the race to lead the Western military alliance after lone challenger Romanian President Klaus Iohannis dropped out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seasoned Dutch leader, who is set to leave office in the Netherlands soon after almost 14 years in charge, will take the reins at a pivotal time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next Nato chief will have to grapple with the ongoing fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine and the potential return to the US presidency of Donald Trump after elections in November. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel’s Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled unanimously that the military must begin drafting ultra-Orthodox men for military service, a decision that could lead to the collapse of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition as Israel continues to wage war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that in the absence of a law that distinguishes between Jewish seminary students and other draftees, Israel’s compulsory military service system applies to the ultra-Orthodox like any other citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under long-standing arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men have been exempt from the draft, which is compulsory for most Jewish men and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These exemptions have long been a source of anger among the secular public, a divide that has widened during the eight-month-old war, as the military has called up tens of thousands of soldiers and says it needs all the manpower it can get. Over 600 soldiers have been killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties, key partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, oppose any change in the current system. If the exemptions are ended, they could bolt the coalition, causing the government to collapse and leading to new elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court decision comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza drags on into its ninth month and the number of dead soldiers continues to mount. (AP)

    'Julian Assange is free', has left Britain: WikiLeaks

Photo: Wikileaks" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758897_1_20240625092957.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Julian Assange's wife Stella on Tuesday thanked campaigners for their support as the WikiLeaks founder was released after five years in British custody.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Julian is free!!!!" she wrote on the social media platform X following confirmation that he had left Belmarsh high-security prison in southeast London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Words cannot express our immense gratitude" to everyone who had backed the global push for his release, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stella Assange met the Australian publisher while he was holed up in Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges that were later dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange, accused of divulging US military secrets related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been due back in court in London next month after winning an appeal against extradition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But WikiLeaks said in a statement: "Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of June 24, after having spent 1,901 days there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stansted airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The media freedom group said sustained campaigning, from grassroots supporters to political leaders and the United Nations, "created the space for a long period of negotiations with the US Department of Justice", leading to a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The organisation said the deal "has not yet been formally finalised".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assange was initially detained for skipping bail in relation to the Swedish case and held in custody while the US extradition request wound its way through court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will now be reunited with his wife, whom he married at a ceremony in the prison, and their two young children, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "WikiLeaks published ground-breaking stories of government corruption and human rights abuses, holding the powerful accountable for their actions," the statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As editor-in-chief, Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people's right to know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As he returns to Australia, we thank all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom. Julian's freedom is our freedom." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jordan Bardella is credited with helping the National Rally party to clean up its extremist image. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758863_1_20240625013313.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French far-right leader Jordan Bardella said on Monday his party was ready to govern as he pledged to curb immigration and tackle cost-of-living issues ahead of the country's most divisive election in decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In three words: we are ready," the 28-year-old president of the National Rally (RN) told a press conference as he unveiled his party's programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Emmanuel Macron threw France into turmoil earlier this month by calling the snap election after his centrist party was trounced by the far-right National Rally (RN) in a European vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weekend polls suggested the RN would win 35-36 percent in the first round on Sunday, ahead of a left-wing alliance on 27-29.5 percent and Macron's centrists in third on 19.5-22 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella, credited with helping the RN clean up its extremist image, has urged voters to give the eurosceptic party an outright majority to allow it to implement its anti-immigration, law-and-order programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seven long years of Macronism has weakened the country," he said, vowing to boost purchasing power, "restore order" and change the law to make it easier to deport foreigners convicted of crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He reiterated plans to tighten borders and make it harder for foreigners born on French soil to gain citizenship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been 30 years the French have not been listened to on this subject," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella added that the RN would focus on "realistic" measures to curb inflation, primarily by cutting energy taxes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also promised a disciplinary "big bang" in schools, including a ban on mobile phones and trialling the introduction of school uniforms, a proposal previously put forward by Macron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On foreign policy, Bardella said the RN opposed sending French troops into Ukraine – as mooted by Macron – but would continue to provide logistical and material support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his party, which had close ties to Russia before its war in Ukraine, would be "extremely vigilant" in the face of Moscow's attempts to interfere in French affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election is shaping up as a showdown between the RN and the leftist New Popular Front, which is dominated by the hard-left France Unbowed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Popular Front has so far refused to say who would be its candidate for prime minister if it wins, with several key figures urging the polarising France Unbowed leader Jean-Luc Melenchon to step back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bardella claimed the RN, which mainstream parties have in the past united to block, was now the "patriotic and republican" choice faced with what he alleged was the anti-Semitism of Melenchon's party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France Unbowed, which vocally opposes Israel's war in Gaza and refused to label the October 7 Hamas attacks as "terrorism," strongly denies the charges of anti-Semitism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In calling an election in just three weeks Macron hoped to trip up his opponents and catch them unprepared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts have warned the move could backfire spectacularly if the deeply unpopular president is forced to share power with a prime minister from an opposing party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marine Le Pen, the RN's figurehead who is bidding to succeed him as president, has called on him to step aside if he loses control of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has insisted he will not resign before the end of his second term in 2027 but has vowed to heed voters' concerns and change course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal cannot be to just continue as things were," Macron said in an open letter in French media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has urged the French not to make the election a referendum on his leadership, saying it is not "a vote of confidence in the president of the republic".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Macron's prime minister Gabriel Attal will go head-to-head with Bardella in a TV debate. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='President Cyril Ramaphosa faces the tricky task of announcing an "inclusive" cabinet in the coming days. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758857_1_20240625001659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's weakened African National Congress (ANC) denounced on Monday "outrageous demands" for cabinet positions by its coalition partners in documents leaked to the press amid negotiations to form a government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Cyril Ramaphosa, 71, who has been re-elected for a second full term, will lead what his ANC calls a government of national unity after losing its outright majority in the May 29 general election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The historied ANC of the late Nelson Mandela has governed South Africa since the advent of democracy in 1994 but only scored 40 percent of the vote last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC "notes with concern that some parties have been making outlandish and outrageous demands for specific cabinet positions in the media," the party said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, local media have reported tensions in negotiations between the ANC and the largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), which won 87 parliamentary seats compared to the ANC's 159.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa faces having to balance demands for key ministerial posts from his party and its new allies, as well as mediating diverging views to agree a common policy agenda on the economy and other pressing matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But almost a month after the vote, no official communication has been made on the number of portfolios that will go to the new parties in government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of state is expected to announce an "inclusive" cabinet in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national unity government has 10 parties in total, including the DA, the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and other smaller groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A document, apparently from the DA and showing its letterhead outlining a list of preferred cabinet positions, has circulated on social media, stirring debate among South Africans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is... reasonable and fair that the DA should have representation across all cabinet clusters. To speed matters along, we set out here our preferred portfolios," the document reads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The list includes the energy, transport, justice, home affairs and foreign ministries, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Negotiating through leaking demands to the media is an act of bad faith and this practice will not help the cause of any party," the ANC said. (AFP)

    'Most victims of South Korean fire were Chinese'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's fire department on Monday said 18 of the 22 killed in a massive blaze at a lithium battery factory were Chinese nationals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 100 people were working in the factory when workers heard a series of explosions from the second floor, where lithium-ion batteries were being inspected and packaged, firefighter Kim Jin-young told media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the massive blaze that ensued, twenty-two people were killed, including 20 foreign nationals -- 18 Chinese, one from Laos, and one of unknown nationality, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most of the bodies are badly burned so it will take some time to identify each one," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were still searching for one more person who remained unaccounted for, Kim said, adding they had managed to contain the largest blaze at the plant and get inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were "doing cooling operations to prevent the fire from expanding to nearby factories," Kim said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images shared by Yonhap after the fire broke out showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vast factory had an estimated 35,000 battery cells on the second floor in storage, with more batteries stored in other areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lithium batteries burn hot and fast, and are difficult to control with conventional fire extinguishing methods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to fears of additional explosions, it was difficult to enter," Kim said, describing the tricky rescue operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As it is a lithium battery manufacturer, we (had) determined that spraying water will not extinguish the fire, so we (used) dry sand," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong city, just south of the capital Seoul. (AFP)

 Authorities in the Russian region of Dagestan on Monday said an operation against gunmen who attacked churches and synagogues and killed at least 20 people was over.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens more were wounded in the attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following the neutralisation of the threats to the lives and health of citizens, it was decided to end the anti-terrorist operation in Dagestan," Russia's National Antiterrorism Committee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gunmen who stormed churches and a synagogue in the predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region on Sunday killed 15 police officers and a priest, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks took place in the Dagestan capital Makhachkala and nearby Derbent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over 15 police fell victim to the terrorist act," Dagestan's regional leader Sergei Melikov said in a video posted on Telegram, adding that they "protected civilians...at the cost of their lives".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial death toll given was eight police officers and a priest. (AFP)

 Around 20 bodies have been found at a South Korean lithium battery factory after a massive blaze on Monday, the Yonhap news agency said, with firefighters saying they were still searching the building.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 100 people were working in the factory when workers heard a series of explosions from the second floor, where lithium-ion batteries are inspected and packaged, firefighter Kim Jin-young told media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 78 people were confirmed safe but many more were still missing, with Yonhap saying that "about 20 bodies (were) found" at the site, after rescue workers finally managed to get inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim told media that they had managed to put out the largest fire at the factory and were pulling bodies out of the charred building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A rescue team has gone inside and is carrying out search and rescue operations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images shared by Yonhap after the fire broke out showed huge plumes of billowing grey smoke rising into the sky above the factory, with orange flames inside the building. Dozens of fire engines were seen outside.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lithium battery plant is owned by Aricell, a South Korean primary battery manufacturer. It is located in Hwaseong city, just south of the capital Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lithium batteries are used in everything from laptops to electric vehicles -- but can be highly explosive, with airlines, for example, imposing strict regulations on checking devices containing them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol issued emergency instructions to authorities, telling them to "mobilise all available personnel and equipment to focus on searching for and rescuing people," his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also warned authorities that they should "ensure the safety of firefighters considering the rapid spread of fire".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighting and rescue efforts were ongoing, and the cause of the fire was unknown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Hwaseong sent out a series of alerts to residents warning them to stay inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a lot of smoke due to factory fires. Please pay attention to safety, such as refraining from going out," one alert sent by text message said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Factory fire. Please detour to surrounding roads and nearby citizens please close windows," another one read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea is a major producer of batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its battery makers supply EV makers around the world, including Tesla.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea is also one of the world's largest producers of high-end semiconductors, and the government has invested heavily in key technologies including displays and batteries. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Benjamin Netanyahu made the comment in his first television interview since the war began. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758724_1_20240624054615.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that "intense" fighting against Hamas militants in the southern Gaza city of Rafah is nearly over, more than eight months into the devastating war.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The intense phase of the fighting against Hamas is about to end," Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 14 network, without providing a clear timeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't mean that the war is about to end, but the war in its intense phase is about to end in Rafah."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli officials have described Rafah as the last Hamas stronghold in the Gaza Strip, and in early May troops entered the southern city, on the besieged territory's border with Egypt, despite global alarm over the fate of Palestinian civilians sheltering there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military seized the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, a key conduit for desperately needed aid into Gaza that has remained shut since then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu's interview – his first with Israeli media since the war began with Hamas's October 7 attack – was broadcast as his defence minister arrived in Washington for talks on the Gaza war and surging cross-border tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the ground in Gaza City, in the north of the Palestinian territory, Israeli bombardment continued on Sunday with medics and the civil defence agency in the Hamas-ruled territory reporting deadly strikes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has traded daily cross-border fire with Israel's army, heightening fears of all-out war particularly over the past two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu said that "after the end of the intense phase" in the Gaza Strip, Israel would "redeploy some forces to the north... primarily for defensive purposes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's visit to Washington, which he said would include meetings that are "critical to this war," follows public statements by Netanyahu concerning US military aid which have added strains to ties with the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has accused Israel's close ally and biggest military supplier of freezing some arms and ammunition deliveries during the war, which US officials have strongly rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he prepared to depart for Washington, Gallant said: "Our ties with the United States are more important than ever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu, who has faced growing pressure from Israeli demonstrators demanding a deal to free hostages still held in Gaza, said he would not agree to any deal that includes a permanent ceasefire – one of Hamas's key demands in stalled mediation efforts for a truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The goal is to return the kidnapped and uproot the Hamas regime in Gaza," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about post-war scenarios for Gaza, Netanyahu said it was "clear" that Israel would maintain "military control in the foreseeable future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also want to create a civilian administration, if possible with local Palestinians" and regional backing "to manage humanitarian supply and later on civilian affairs in the Strip," Netanyahu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar proposals Netanyahu had presented to his ministers in February were swiftly rejected by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, and prompted US warnings against the "Israeli reoccupation of Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two members of Netanyahu's war cabinet, former military chiefs Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, left the government earlier this month over the lack of post-war plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, Israeli forces kept striking targets and battling Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza City, medics at Al-Ahli hospital said that at least five people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a facility of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its jets struck militants who "operated from within buildings that previously served as an UNRWA headquarters."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from UNRWA, whose facilities have come under attack before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some UNRWA buildings have been turned into shelters for displaced Palestinians during the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An early morning air raid on a family home elsewhere in Gaza City killed at least seven people, the civil defence agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, Gaza's health ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This war must stop," said Umm Siraj al-Balawi, struggling to survive in a makeshift shelter amid a field of rubble, with strung-up sheets protecting her young children from the blazing sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite the needs, "delivery of any meaningful humanitarian assistance inside Gaza has become almost impossible and the very fabric of civil society is unravelling," the European Union said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the war has raged on, Israeli protesters have taken to the streets week after week demanding greater efforts to bring home the remaining hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his Sunday interview, Netanyahu said that if his rule ends, "a left-wing government will... establish a Palestinian state," dubbing it a threat to "our existence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Lebanon, Hezbollah said it had targeted military positions in northern Israel with attack drones, after an Israeli strike in eastern Lebanon killed the commander of another armed group, Jamaa Islamiya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Israeli military said plans for a Lebanon offensive had been approved, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah responded that no part of Israel would be spared in the event of a full-scale war. (AFP)

    Saudi says 1,301 pilgrims died during hajj
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Many pilgrims simply collapsed in the scorching summer heat. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758718_1_20240624035659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia said on Sunday that more than 1,300 faithful died during the hajj pilgrimage which took place during intense heat, and that most of the deceased did not have official permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301, with 83 percent being unauthorised to perform hajj and having walked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort," the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tally last week, based on official statements and reports from diplomats involved in their countries' responses, put the toll at more than 1,100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arab diplomats said that Egyptians accounted for 658 deaths – 630 of them unregistered pilgrims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riyadh had not publicly commented on the deaths or provided its own toll until Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, however, a senior Saudi official gave a partial toll of 577 deaths for the two busiest days of hajj: June 15, when pilgrims gathered for hours of prayers in the blazing sun on Mount Arafat, and June 16, when they participated in the "stoning of the devil" ritual in Mina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official also defended Riyadh's response, saying: "The state did not fail, but there was a misjudgement on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saudi health minister, Fahd Al-Jalajel, on Sunday described management of the hajj this year as "successful," SPA reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the health system "provided more than 465,000 specialised treatment services, including 141,000 services to those who didn't obtain official authorisation to perform hajj," according to SPA, which summarised an interview he gave to the state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims with the means must complete at least once in their lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi officials have said 1.8 million pilgrims took part this year, a similar number to last year, and that 1.6 million came from abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures in Mecca this year climbed as high as 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly ordered 16 tourism companies stripped of their licences and referred their managers to the public prosecutor over illegal pilgrimages to Mecca, Egypt's cabinet said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the rise in the number of deaths of unregistered Egyptian pilgrims stemmed from some companies which "organised the hajj programmes using a personal visit visa, which prevents its holders from entering Mecca" via official channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs spur many to attempt the hajj without a permit, though they risk arrest and deportation if caught. (AFP)

    Kenya's Ruto ready for 'conversation' with protesters

    <![CDATA[<img alt="There was no immediate response to his offer from the mostly young protesters, who have called for a national strike on June 25. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758715_1_20240624022807.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenya's President William Ruto said on Sunday that he was ready for "a conversation" with thousands of "peaceful" young protesters who held nationwide demonstrations this week to oppose proposed tax increases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Organised on social media and led largely by Gen-Z Kenyans who have livestreamed the demonstrations, the protests have caught Ruto's government off-guard, as discontent mounts over his economic policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very proud of our young people... they have stepped forward peaceful and I want to tell them we are going to engage them," Ruto said in his first public comments on the protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to have a conversation so that together we can build a greater nation," Ruto said during a church service in the Rift Valley town of Nyahururu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His characterisation of the protests as "peaceful" came after rights campaigners reported two deaths following Thursday's demonstrations in Nairobi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate response to his remarks from the protesters, who have called for a national strike on June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations were mostly peaceful, but officers fired tear gas and water cannon throughout the day to disperse protesters near parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Kenya Human Rights Commission official said on Saturday that 21-year-old Evans Kiratu was "hit by a tear gas canister" during the protests and died in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, a police watchdog said it was investigating allegations that a 29-year-old man was shot by officers in Nairobi after the demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said it had "documented the death... allegedly as a result of police shooting" on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several organisations, including Amnesty International Kenya, said that at least 200 people were injured in the protests in Nairobi, as thousands of people took to the streets across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following smaller-scale demonstrations in Nairobi on Tuesday, the cash-strapped government agreed to roll back several tax hikes laid out in a new bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Ruto's administration still intends to increase some taxes, defending the levies as necessary for filling its coffers and cutting reliance on external borrowing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya has a vast debt mountain, and servicing costs have ballooned due to a fall in the value of the local currency over the last two years, leaving Ruto with few options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tax hikes will pile further pressure on Kenyans, with many already struggling as the cost of living surges and well-paid jobs remain out of reach for young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said on Sunday that the annual budget included measures to tackle youth unemployment and improve access to higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I want to assure (the protesters)... is that we are concerned about their issues," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are going to make sure that every child has access to higher education."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the government agreed to scrap levies on bread purchases, car ownership as well as financial and mobile services, the treasury warned of a 200-billion-shilling (US$1.5-billion) shortfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has now targeted an increase in fuel prices and export taxes to fill the void left by the changes, a move critics say will make life more expensive in a country already saddled with high inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya is one of the most dynamic economies in East Africa but a third of its 51.5 million people live in poverty. (AFP)

    Power cut causes chaos at UK's Manchester airport

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Flights at the UK's third-busiest airport were being delayed or cancelled on Sunday after a major power cut, the airport operator said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Manchester Airports Group, which also operates London Stansted and the East Midlands airports, said Manchester Airport had been "affected by a major power cut in the area earlier this morning."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Power has now been restored at the international airport in the north of England, but passengers due to travel from Terminals One and Two were told to "not come to the airport" as all flights were cancelled "until further notice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers for Terminal Three were told to come to the airport as normal, but were warned they "could be affected by delays."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airport operator said that while passengers already checked in were scheduled to depart as planned, the disruption meant "some baggage may not be on those flights."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work with airlines and handling partners to reunite affected passengers with their luggage as soon as possible," the group added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline Jet2 – which operates from both terminals – said that as well as cancelling dozens of flights, it was unable to load bags onto planes as the airport's baggage system remained "inoperable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airline easyJet, which operates flights from Terminal One, warned of "very long queues" for security, and said passengers could only board flights with cabin bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, some arriving flights were being diverted to other airports according to the airport statement, including London Heathrow and Birmingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some flyers took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to describe the "chaos," with one passenger saying they had been waiting for their bags after landing after midnight and another saying they were "stuck on the plane." (AFP)

    Woman mauled by wolves at French zoo fighting for life

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758705_1_20240623225530.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three wolves in a zoo outside Paris attacked a 37-year-old woman leaving her fighting for her life, a source familiar with the case and local prosecutors said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The woman was bitten "on the neck, the calf and the back" at the Thoiry zoo around 40 kilometres west of the French capital, the source said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maryvonne Caillibotte, chief prosecutor in Versailles, said the woman's life was in danger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman is believed to have gone out alone for a jog after spending the night with her family in a safari-style lodge at the zoo, which it advertised on its website at between 220 and 760 euros (US$235-810) per night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lodges in the wolf zone promise "silence, rest and disconnection", according to the zoo's adverts. They offer "a one-of-a-kind, very intimate experience with the arctic wolves you'll be able to see from the living room."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman "ended up in the safari zone, which is supposed to be restricted to cars. That's where she was attacked by three wolves," Caillibotte said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that it was not clear "whether she made a mistake or the trail wasn't clearly marked."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First responders got to the scene "very quickly," the wolves were "moved away, then returned to their area," Caillibotte siad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The source familiar with the case earlier said the woman must have got through "security systems, a trench and an electric fence supposed to keep the animals in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police are investigating the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thoiry zoo was founded in 1968 by Paul de la Panouse, owner of a local chateau that has been in his family since the 16th Century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He recalled to regional newspaper L'Independant in April how he initially stocked the zoo with a ship loaded with 120 animals brought from Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De la Panouse sold the zoo to a group of investors in 2018. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was headed to Washington on Sunday for "critical" talks on the Gaza war raging since October 7 and surging cross-border tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced hope for speedy progress on unfreezing US arms and ammunition deliveries from Israel's top ally which he said had dropped off sharply in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden has been at odds with Israel's veteran right-wing leader over Gaza's surging civilian death toll, but US officials have said they were not aware of what Netanyahu was referring to on the arms issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli premier on Sunday told his cabinet that "about four months ago, there was a dramatic drop in the supply of armaments arriving from the US to Israel. We got all sorts of explanations, but... the basic situation didn't change."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he voiced hope the issue would now be cleared up: "In light of what I have heard in the last day, I hope and believe that this issue will be resolved in the near future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli forces again bombed Gaza on Sunday, a day after tens of thousands staged a protest rally in Tel Aviv against the government and to demand the return of hostages being held by Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have also flared on Israel's northern border with Lebanon whose Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has traded daily cross-border fire with the army, heightening fears of all-out war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gallant said he would "discuss developments in Gaza and Lebanon," vowing that "we are prepared for any action that may be required in Gaza, Lebanon and in additional areas."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that "our ties with the United States are more important than ever. Our meetings with US officials are critical to this war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, Israeli forces kept striking targets and battling Hamas, the Islamist militant group Israel has vowed to destroy over its October 7 attack, in a war that has devastated much of the coastal territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Warplanes had struck "dozens of terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip, including military structures, terrorists and terrorist infrastructure" over the past 24 hours, a military statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Gaza war has raged on for over eight months, Israeli protesters have taken to the streets week after week demanding greater efforts to bring home the remaining hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening drew more than 150,000 people, according to the organisation Israel Democracy HQ – Hofshi B'Artzenu, which called it the biggest rally since the Gaza war began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many demonstrators voiced anger and frustration with Netanyahu and his far-right allies, accusing them of prolonging the war and putting the country's security and hostages at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many held signs reading "Crime Minister" and "Stop the War" while some lay on the ground covered in red paint to protest what they labelled the death of Israel's democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an address to the crowd, Yuval Diskin, a former head of Israel's domestic security agency Shin Bet, condemned Netanyahu as Israel's "worst prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out with Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,598 people, also mostly civilians, Gaza's health ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli siege has deprived Gaza's 2.4 million people of most drinking water, food, fuel and other essentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This war must stop," said Umm Siraj al-Balawi, surviving in a makeshift shelter amid a field of rubble, with strung-up sheets protecting her young children from the blazing sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are getting displaced from house to house, tent to tent, school to school," she said. "This is a war of displacement. It's a war of annihilation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lebanon's Hezbollah meanwhile said it had targeted a military position in northern Israel "with an attack drone" in response to the killing of a commander of the Jamaa Islamiya group in a strike on eastern Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said no one was injured in the attack on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah had hours earlier published a video excerpt purporting to show locations in Israel along with their coordinates, amid heightening fears of an all-out conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said last Tuesday that a plan for a Lebanon offensive had been "approved and validated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah responded with threats that no part of Israel would be spared in the event of a full-scale war. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pro-independence leader in the French Pacific territory New Caledonia will be held in France after being charged on Saturday over deadly riots last month, his lawyer said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Christian Tein, head of the CCAT group, will be sent almost 17,000 kilometres to France with the group's communications chief Brenda Wanabo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An investigating magistrate charged Tein in New Caledonia's capital Noumea on Saturday. He was the first from a group of 11 people arrested on Wednesday to be charged over the violence, in which nine people died, including two police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of people were wounded, and around US$1.6 billion of damage was inflicted during the troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not immediately say what charges Tein faces, although Noumea chief prosecutor Yves Dupas said his investigation covered armed robbery and complicity in murder or attempted murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tein's lawyer Pierre Ortent said he was "stupefied" that his client would be sent to a prison in Mulhouse in eastern France. Wanabo's representative Thomas Gruet said she would be sent to Dijon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dupas confirmed that some of those arrested on Wednesday would be transferred to custody in France, without giving names.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one had any idea in advance that they would be sent to mainland France. These are totally exceptional steps" for New Caledonia, Ortent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gruet said Wanabo, a mother of three children, "had never called for violence" and was "distraught" to be separated from her family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The legal system has committed every error in managing this crisis," he added, saying magistrates were "answering to purely political considerations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stephane Bonomo, lawyer for another detainee, Gilles Joredie, said the prosecutor's actions were creating "martyrs for the independence cause".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riots, street barricades and looting broke out in New Caledonia in mid-May over an electoral reform that indigenous Kanak people said would leave them in a permanent minority, putting independence hopes definitively out of reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's government repeatedly accused Tein's CCAT of orchestrating the violence, to which it responded by sending over 3,000 troops and police to the territory. The CCAT has denied being behind the riots. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell on Saturday called for a probe into deadly shelling that damaged an office of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The EU condemns the shelling which damaged the ICRC office in Gaza and led to dozens of casualties. An independent investigation is needed and those responsible must be held accountable," Borrell wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, days after Israel announced a daily pause in fighting on a key route to allow more aid into Gaza, chaos in the besieged Palestinian territory has left vital supplies piled up and undistributed in the searing summer heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than eight months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip and repeated UN warnings of famine with outside aid severely restricted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Desperation among Gaza's 2.4 million population has increased as fighting rages, sparking warnings from aid agencies that they are unable to deliver aid including vegetables.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel says it has let supplies in and called on agencies to step up deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The breakdown of public order and safety is increasingly endangering humanitarian workers and operations in Gaza," the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, also known as OCHA, said in a briefing on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Alongside the fighting, criminal activities and the risk of theft and robbery has effectively prevented humanitarian access to critical locations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israel says it has allowed hundreds of trucks of aid into southern Gaza, trading blame with the United Nations over why the aid is stacking up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shared aerial footage of white and black containers lined up on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and more trucks arriving to add to the stockpile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With civil order breaking down in the territory, the UN says it has been unable to pick up any supplies from Kerem Shalom since Tuesday, leaving crucial aid in limbo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A deputy UN spokesman this week said the crossing "is operating with limited functionality, including because of fighting in the area". (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Long March 2-C rocket carrying a satellite jointly developed by China and France dubbed the Space Variable Objects Monitor, lifts off from a space base in Xichang, in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758613_1_20240622222543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has launched a satellite in cooperation with France to catch gamma-ray bursts in the universe's outermost regions, in a notable example of cooperation between a Western power and the Asian giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Developed by engineers from both countries, the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is carrying four instruments -- two French, two Chinese -- that will seek out gamma-ray bursts, the light from which has travelled billions of light years to reach Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 930-kilogram (2,050-pound) satellite "successfully" took off around 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) aboard a Chinese Long March 2-C rocket from a space base in Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province, China's National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gamma-ray bursts generally occur after the explosion of huge stars -- those more than 20 times as big as the sun -- or the fusion of compact stars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The extremely bright cosmic beams can give off a blast of energy equivalent to more than a billion billion suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observing them is like "looking back in time, as the light from these objects takes a long time to reach us", Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Astrophysics in New York, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rays carry traces of the gas clouds and galaxies they pass through on their journey through space -- valuable data for better understanding the history and evolution of the universe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVOM has the potential to unravel several mysteries in the field of (gamma-ray bursts), including detecting the most distant GRBs in the universe, which correspond to the earliest GRBs," Gottlieb said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most distant bursts identified to date were produced just 630 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was in its infancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are... interested in gamma-ray bursts for their own sake because they are very extreme cosmic explosions which allow us to better understand the death of certain stars," said Frederic Daigne, an astrophysicist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of this data makes it possible to test the laws of physics with phenomena that are impossible to reproduce in the laboratory on Earth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once analysed, the data could help to improve understanding of the composition of space, and the dynamics of gas clouds or other galaxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Leader of Reform UK Nigel Farage delivers a speech at a hotel in Blackpool, England, in the build-up to the UK general election on July 4. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758615_1_20240622214426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nigel Farage, leader of Britain's anti-immigration Reform UK party, faced strong criticism on Saturday after saying that the West provoked Russia's attack on Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with a British media outlet on Friday, Farage said "we've provoked this war", while adding that "of course" it was Russian president Vladimir Putin's "fault".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told reporters that Farage's claim was "completely wrong and only plays into Putin's hands".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour leader Keir Starmer, who looks set to take Sunak's job after an election next month, said Farage's comments were "disgraceful".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anyone who is standing for parliament ought to be really clear that Russia is the aggressor", he told reporters on the campaign trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage -- a former European Union parliamentarian who has tried and failed to run for Westminster seven times -- is seeking a seat for Clacton in east England in the country's general election next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His party is polling third behind the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour parties, but is only predicted to pick up a few seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even so, a surge of popularity for Reform UK since Farage took over as leader this month risks drawing away votes that the Conservative party sorely needs to win a fifth term in power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments met with outrage on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister James Cleverly criticised Farage for "echoing Putin's vile justification for the brutal invasion of Ukraine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Conservative defence minister Tobias Ellwood called the comments "shocking" in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, adding that "Churchill will be turning in his grave".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Labour's defence spokesman John Healey called the comments "disgraceful" and said his stance made him "unfit for any political office in our country".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Probed further on his views on Putin in the interview, Farage said that he "disliked him as a person" but "admired him as a political operator because he's managed to take control of running Russia".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former Brexit figurehead, Farage is close to former US President Donald Trump, who has said he gets along with Putin "great".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage has also spoken about his intention to run for prime minister in 2029.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stood by claims that Sunak, the first UK prime minister of colour, does not "understand our culture", in response to Sunak leaving D-Day commemorations in France early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He clarified in the interview that he meant Sunak was "too upper class".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage's comments on Sunak -- first made in a political leaders debate -- also drew criticism, with one Tory minister saying they made him "very uncomfortable". (AFP)

    Nasa again postpones return of Boeing Starliner

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Nasa did not set a new date, raising questions about the timing of the return. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758566_1_20240622104348.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa has further postponed the Boeing Starliner's return to Earth from the International Space Station with its first crew of astronauts, to allow more time for review of technical issues encountered, the agency said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It did not set a new date, raising questions about the timing of the return of the two astronauts on Boeing's first crewed mission, which had initially been set for June 26, itself a pushback from the first potential date of June 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mission managers are evaluating future return opportunities following the station’s two planned spacewalks on June 24 and July 2," Nasa said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, lifted off on June 5 as a final demonstration to obtain routine flight certification from Nasa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process," said Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew programme manager.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Starliner is performing well in orbit while docked to the space station," Stich said, adding that the additional time would yield "valuable insight" into system upgrades for future missions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crewed test of the spacecraft, test-flown to space two times since 2019 without humans on board, has encountered five failures of its 28 manoeuvring thrusters, five leaks of helium gas meant to pressurise those thrusters, and a slow-moving propellant valve that signalled unfixed past issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issues and the additional tests run by Nasa and Boeing call into question when exactly Starliner's crew will be able to make the roughly six-hour return journey home, and add to the programme's broader problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has spent US$1.5 billion in cost overruns beyond its US$4.5-billion Nasa development contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa wants Starliner to become a second US spacecraft capable of ferrying astronauts with the ISS, alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, its primary ride since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Boeing's Starliner programme has battled software glitches, design problems and subcontractor disputes for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Starliner arrived in the space station's vicinity to dock on June 6, the five thruster failures prevented a close approach by the spacecraft until Boeing made a fix.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It rewrote software and tweaked some procedures to revive four of them and proceed with a docking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner's undocking and return to Earth represent the spacecraft's most complicated phases of its test mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasa officials have said they want to better understand the cause of the thruster failures, valve issue and helium leaks before Starliner begins its return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While just one thruster remains dead in Starliner's current flight, Boeing encountered four thruster problems during the capsule's uncrewed return from space in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flight rules set by Boeing and Nasa require Starliner's manoeuvring thrusters to allow for "six degrees of freedom of control," at a minimum, and each have one backup thruster, a Nasa spokesperson told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That could mean at least 12 of the 28 thrusters, most of them backups, are required for a safe flight. (Reuters)

 A shooter opened fire at an Arkansas supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers, Arkansas State Police said. The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police, Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 112 km south of Little Rock.

  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody," Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident," she said. (Reuters)

 European Union countries on Friday formally approved the launch of accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova next week, another step in the two nations' long journey to join the 27-nation bloc.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Belgium, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, said member states have agreed on a negotiating framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This opens the way for launching the negotiations on Tuesday 25 June in Luxembourg,” the Belgian presidency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a positive assessment from the bloc’s executive branch, EU leaders had already agreed last year that accession negotiations should start with both countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The process between the start of negotiations with Ukraine and its neighbour Moldova and their becoming EU member states could take many years. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Armenia has officially recognised a Palestinian state, the Armenian foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday, the latest country to do so despite opposition from Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's foreign ministry said it summoned Armenia's ambassador to Israel after the former Soviet republic declared its recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following Armenia's recognition of a Palestinian state, the foreign ministry summoned the Armenian ambassador in Israel for a severe reprimand," it said in a statement shortly after Armenia's announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Armenia supports a United Nations resolution on an immediate ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and is in favour of a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the same statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, welcomed Armenia’s decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This recognition contributes positively to preserving the two-state solution, which faces systematic challenges, and promotes security, peace, and stability for all parties involved," the Authority's presidency said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain, Ireland and Norway were among several Western countries to officially recognise a Palestinian state, prompting Israel to pull its ambassadors from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo last month. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s military on Friday said it had fired warnings shots the previous day to repel North Korean soldiers who temporarily crossed the demarcation line between the two countries for the third time this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers while engaging in unspecified construction work on the northern side of the border briefly intruded the military demarcation line that bisects the countries at around 11am on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean military in response broadcast a warning and fired warning shots, to which the North Korean soldiers retreated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint chiefs didn't immediately release more details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s military has said it believes the previous two border intrusions this month weren’t intentional as the North Korean soldiers retreated after the warning shots and the North did not return fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South’s military said it had been observing increased North Korean construction activity in front-line border areas since April, such as installing suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforcing roads and planting land mines. (AP)

    UK's Sunak angered over election gambling probes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beleaguered Rishi Sunak faced questions over the gambling scandal on a BBC programme. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758374_1_20240621052318.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Thursday he was "incredibly angry" after more Conservative Party figures were put under investigation over alleged bets placed on the UK general election date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Facing questions on the growing scandal from an audience of voters on live television, the beleaguered leader said any election candidates or officials found to have broken rules would be kicked out of the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came hours after the Conservatives' campaign director stepped aside following reports that he and his wife, a Tory candidate in the July 4 election, were under investigation by betting regulators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, another would-be MP, Craig Williams, who was a Sunak ministerial aide, was also being probed for staking £100 (US$127) on the date before it was called.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London police said on Wednesday that one of the prime minister's police security detail had been arrested for allegedly placing a bet on the date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was incredibly angry... to learn of these allegations," Sunak said of the cases involving his party officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If anyone is found to have broken the rules, not only should they face the full consequences of the law, I will make sure that they are booted out of the Conservative Party," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Conservatives confirmed earlier that campaign director Tony Lee had started "a leave of absence" and that the Gambling Commission was looking into "a number of individuals".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regulator did not name individuals but the BBC reported that Lee and his election candidate wife Laura Saunders were under investigation. Her lawyers said she would "be co-operating with the Gambling Commission" and claimed the report infringed her privacy rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission had already said it was looking at the claims regarding Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Political bets are allowed in the UK, including on the date of elections, but using insider knowledge to do so is against the law. (AFP)

    Deadly heatwaves on four continents as summer begins

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deadly heatwaves are scorching cities on four continents as the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer, a sign that climate change may again help to fuel record-breaking heat that could surpass last summer as the warmest in 2,000 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Record temperatures in recent days are suspected to have caused hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths across Asia and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Saudi Arabia, nearly two million Muslim pilgrims are finishing the haj at the Grand Mosque in Mecca this week. But hundreds have died during the journey amid temperatures above 51 degrees Celsius, according to reports from foreign authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Countries around the Mediterranean have also endured another week of blistering high temperatures that have contributed to forest fires from Portugal to Greece and along the northern coast of Africa in Algeria, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Observatory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Serbia, meteorologists forecast temperatures of around 40C this week as winds from North Africa propelled a hot front across the Balkans. Health authorities declared a red weather alert and advised people not to venture outdoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Belgrade's emergency service said its doctors intervened 109 times overnight to treat people with heart and chronic health conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In neighbouring Montenegro, where health authorities also warned people to stay in the shade until late afternoon, tens of thousands of tourists sought refreshment on the beaches along its Adriatic coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of the US Northeast and Midwest are also wilting under a heat dome, with more than 86 million people under a heat alert on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A heat dome occurs when a strong, high-pressure system traps hot air over a region, preventing cool air from getting in and causing ground temperatures to remain high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's summer period lasts from March to May, when monsoons begin slowly sweeping across the country and breaking the heat. But New Delhi on Wednesday registered its warmest night in at least 55 years, with India's Safdarjung Observatory reporting a temperature of 35.2 C at 1am. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Sutherland, one of Canada's most versatile and gifted actors, who charmed and enthralled audiences in films such as "M*A*S*H," "Klute," "Ordinary People" and the "Hunger Games" films, has died at the age of 88.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Canadian actor, whose lengthy career spanned from the 1960s into the 2020s, died on Thursday, his son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, said on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tall actor with a deep voice, piercing blue eyes and mischievous smile managed to switch effortlessly from character roles to romantic leads, opposite the likes of Jane Fonda and Julie Christie. He also played his share of oddballs and villains during a career that began in the 1960s.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the 1970s, he remained in demand for film and TV projects into his 80s. Known for his unconventional looks and his versatility as an actor, Sutherland played a wide range of memorable characters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These included a rascally Army surgeon in "M*A*S*H" (1970), a quirky tank commander in "Kelly's Heroes" (1970), a small-town detective in "Klute" (1971), a stoned and libidinous professor in "Animal House" (1978), a local official facing an alien presence in "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1978) and a despairing father in "Ordinary People" (1980). He won a new generation of fans with his glorious portrayal of a despotic president in "The Hunger Games" (2012) and its sequels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wish I could say thank you to all of the characters that I've played, thank them for using their lives to inform my life," Sutherland said in his speech accepting an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 2017. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia was thinking about possible changes to its doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The existing doctrine states that Russia may use such weapons in response to a nuclear attack or in the event of a conventional attack that poses an existential threat to the state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the war in Ukraine, some hawks among Russian military analysts have been advocating that Russia should lower its threshold for nuclear use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin said, however, that there was no need for Russia to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was speaking to reporters a day after visiting nuclear-armed North Korea for a summit with its leader, Kim Jong Un. The two leaders signed a treaty under which each side promised to provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed aggression against either one of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian state media quoted Putin as saying that Moscow expected that its cooperation with North Korea would serve as a deterrent to the West, but that there was no need to use North Korean soldiers in the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also said he did not rule out Russia supplying high-precision weapons to North Korea. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romanian President Klaus Iohannis withdrew from the race to lead Nato on Thursday, clearing the way for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to become the next secretary-general of the transatlantic military alliance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All other Nato members had already backed Rutte, a staunch ally of Ukraine and outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to take over from Jens Stoltenberg, who is stepping down this year after a decade in charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the war in Ukraine on Nato's doorstep and European nations concerned about the possible return of Nato-critical Donald Trump to the White House, alliance members concluded the highly experienced Rutte was the best person for the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As it announced Iohannis's decision, Romania's supreme defence council said it would donate one of the country's two operational Patriot systems to Ukraine, responding to pleas from Kyiv to its allies for more air defence assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Romania's decision "will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supreme council, which is chaired by Iohannis, said the president had informed Nato last week of his decision to withdraw and Romania would now support Rutte's candidacy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With all 32 Nato members now backing the Dutchman, diplomats said they expected the alliance's governing North Atlantic Council to formally select him for the post in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia, while guarding against any escalation that could draw Nato directly into a war with Moscow. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a series of deals with his Vietnamese counterpart To Lam during a state visit that comes as Moscow sought to bolster ties in Asia to offset growing international isolation over its military actions in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two signed agreements to further cooperation on education, science and technology, energy, climate change and health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Strengthening a comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam is always one of our priorities,” said Putin, according to Russian news agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin had arrived at Vietnam’s Presidential Palace on Thursday afternoon, where he was greeted by school children waving Russian and Vietnamese flags. There he shook hands with and embraced Vietnam’s new President To Lam before a bilateral meeting and a joint briefing to the media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin had arrived in Hanoi early Thursday morning from North Korea, where he and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed an agreement that pledged mutual aid in the event of war.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Diplomats from Arab nations on Thursday said hundreds of people had died during this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia as the faithful faced intense high temperatures at Islamic holy sites in the desert kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not commented on the death toll amid the heat during the pilgrimage, required of every able Muslim once in their life, nor offered any causes for those who died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, hundreds of people had lined up at the Emergency Complex in the Al-Muaisem neighbourhood in Mecca, trying to get information about their missing family members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports were conflicting, but unofficial accounts suggested that at least 500 people had died during the Hajj pilgrimage, with some saying the death toll was likely higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deaths are not uncommon at the Hajj, which has seen at times over two million people travel to Saudi Arabia. There have also been stampedes and epidemics through the pilgrimage’s history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the high temperatures and intense heat made things especially treacherous for pilgrims this year, with temperatures hitting 51.8 degrees Celsius in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, on Monday. (Agencies)

    Louisiana makes Ten Commandments compulsory in classes

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry on Wednesday signed into law a bill that makes the state the only one in the country to require displaying the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The American Civil Liberties Union immediately announced it would sue to block the law, saying it violates the constitutional separation of church and state and a US Supreme Court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landry signed the bill along with a package of others he said were designed to "expand faith in public schools."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law-giver, which was Moses," Landry said at the signing ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Christian and Jewish faiths, God revealed the Ten Commandments to Hebrew prophet Moses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other measures would authorise the hiring of chaplains in schools, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender pupil's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landry also signed bills that would expand tutoring for underperforming students, help improve maths skills, and impose fewer curriculum mandates on teachers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil rights group ACLU and its Louisiana chapter along with Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation announced they would file a lawsuit to challenge the law that requires a specific text of the Ten Commandments be prominently displayed in all classrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other state has such a law, the groups said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools," the statement said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Vietnam early on Thursday for talks with the country's leaders on the final stop of his two-nation tour of Asia after concluding a defence pact with North Korea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin's aircraft touched down at Hanoi's airport, where he was met on a red carpet by Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha and top Communist Party diplomat Le Hoai Trung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an opinion piece timed for his visit, Putin applauded the Southeast Asian Communist-ruled country for supporting "a pragmatic way to solve the crisis" in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam, which officially pursues a neutral foreign policy, has abstained from condemning Russia's attack on Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as praising Vietnam for its "balanced" stance on the Ukraine war, Putin listed progress on payments, energy and trade between the countries in the article published in Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Southeast Asian country is the third nation Putin has visited, after China and North Korea, since he was sworn in for a fifth term in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vietnam has been gearing up for a full state welcome for Putin, his first visit since 2017 and his fifth in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is due to meet Communist Party leader Nguyen Phu Trong, President To Lam and Prime Minster Pham Minh Chinh. (Reuters)

    Nowhere in Israel safe if war erupts: Hezbollah chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Wednesday that nowhere in Israel would be safe if a full-fledged war breaks out between the two foes, and he also threatened Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterannean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel for more than eight months in parallel with the Gaza War. On Tuesday, the group published what it said was drone footage of sensitive military sites deep in Israeli territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a televised address on Wednesday, Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said "there will be no place safe from our missiles and our drones" in Israel in the event of a broader war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group also had "a bank of targets" that it could target in precision strikes, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel "knows that what also awaits it in the Mediterranean is very big...In the face of a battle of this magnitude, it knows that it must now wait for us on land, in the air, and at sea," Nasrallah added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group first showed it could hit a vessel at sea by striking an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean during their 2006 war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports by media and analysts have for years indicated that Hezbollah acquired Russian-made anti-ship Yakhont missiles in Syria, after its forces deployed there more than a decade ago to help President Bashar al-Assad fight the country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasrallah also threatened Cyprus for the first time, accusing it of allowing Israel to use its airports and bases for military exercises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Cypriot government must be warned that opening Cypriot airports and bases for the Israeli enemy to target Lebanon means that the Cypriot government has become part of the war and the resistance (Hezbollah) will deal with it as part of the war," Nasrallah said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate comment from authorities in Cyprus. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10 people, including eight Rohingya Muslims, were killed and several others injured on Wednesday after heavy monsoon rains triggered landslides in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People died in landslides at four separate places in the early hours of Wednesday, Mohammad Shamsud Douza, a senior Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said after days of heavy rain as the monsoon season began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said children and women are among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 1 million Rohingya live in crowded camps in the border district of Cox's Bazar, the world's largest refugee settlement, after fleeing a military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bangladesh weather office said it expected heavy rains to continue for the next few days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rohingya refugees mostly live in shacks made of bamboo and plastic sheets, often on steep, bare hills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are facing a terrible situation in the camps due to the rain, even the narrow paths are so slippery and dangerous," Rohingya refugee Mohammed Kamal said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Torrential rain and the onrush of upstream water from India also left hundreds of thousands of people marooned in the northeastern region of Bangladesh, still recovering from a cyclone that hit the country's coastal belt in the southern part late last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 500,000 people have been affected by the flood in the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj, with water levels surpassing danger levels at six points along four rivers in the region, officials said. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environmental protesters sprayed paint on Britain's Stonehenge on Wednesday, with orange marks covering some of the stones of the prehistoric megalithic structure on the eve of the summer solstice celebrations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two people have been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument, police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is extremely upsetting and our curators are investigating the extent of the damage," English Heritage, the charity that manages Stonehenge, said on X. Stonehenge remains open, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The monument, one of Britain's most visited tourist spots, also holds spiritual significance and attracts thousands of revellers, spiritualists and tourists during the summer solstice – the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In video released by environmental group Just Stop Oil, two protesters were seen running towards two of Stonehenge's megaliths and spraying paint as another person attempted to stop them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public were able to walk around within the stone circle, located in southern England, until 1977 when it was fenced off due to concerns over damage from a sharp rise in the number of visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just Stop Oil are a disgrace," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on X of the protest at the Unesco World Heritage Site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just Stop Oil has gained prominence in Britain for disruptive environmental protests, with its activists shutting down major roads, disrupting cultural and sporting events and even throwing soup at a Van Gogh painting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group wants the British government to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was sworn in on Wednesday for a second term in which his African National Congress (ANC) will share power with other parties after it lost its majority for the first time in 30 years of democracy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A former liberation movement, the ANC came to power under Nelson Mandela's leadership in the 1994 elections that marked the end of apartheid and had long been unbeatable, but it lost its shine after presiding over years of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a parliamentary election on May 29 in which no party won a majority, Ramaphosa will head a government of national unity with five other parties, including the ANC's largest rival, the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While investors have welcomed the inclusion of the DA, which wants to boost growth through structural reforms and prudent fiscal policies, analysts said sharp ideological divisions between the parties could make the government unstable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just before the election, Ramaphosa signed into law a National Health Insurance bill that the DA said could collapse the country's health system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear what would happen to that law under the new government. (AP)

    Russia says open to prisoner swap with the US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Evan Gershkovich will go on trial behind closed door on charges of espionage next week, but Russia has hinted at a possible prisoner swap for the Wall Street Journal reporter. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758132_1_20240619154436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Wednesday said it was waiting for the United States to respond to its proposals for a prisoner swap, a week before reporter Evan Gershkovich was set to face trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The ball is in the court of the United States, we are waiting for them to respond to the ideas that were presented to them," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russia's state media in an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich, a US citizen and a journalist with the Wall Street Journal, has been behind bars since his March 2023 arrest and faces 20 years in prison if convicted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial is to be held in the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, where he was arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich has since been held in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, about 1,400 kilometres to the west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the trial would be closed to the public, as is usual in espionage cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich is accused of “gathering secret information” on orders from the CIA about Uralvagonzavod, a facility that produces and repairs military equipment, the Prosecutor General’s office said last week in the first details of the accusations against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he believes a deal could be reached to free Gershkovich, hinting he would be open to swapping him for a Russian national imprisoned in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That appeared to be Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence for the 2019 killing in Berlin of a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that Moscow and Pyongyang would sign an agreement that would bolster their ties, and thanked North Korea for supporting the Kremlin's policies in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the start of his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the Russian leader said in remarks carried by Russian state media that the “new fundamental document will form the basis of our ties for a long perspective.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin also hailed a “close friendship” between the two countries based on “equality and respect of mutual interests,” and noted their “fight against the imperialist hegemonistic policies of the US and its satellites against the Russian Federation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin expressed his hope that the next meeting between the pair would "take place in Moscow" in an apparent invitation to the North Korean leader to visit the Russian capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian president and Kim later signed a partnership that included a vow of mutual aid if either country is attacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear what kind of assistance the deal, described as a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” would call for.

  Putin’s first visit to North Korea in 24 years comes amid growing concerns over an arms arrangement in which the country provides Moscow with essential munitions for the war in Ukraine in exchange for economic assistance and technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by Kim’s nuclear weapons and missile programme.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's CEO acknowledged to a US congressional panel on Tuesday that the company's culture was imperfect, but insisted the aviation giant was making progress and committed to improving safety.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Our culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress," David Calhoun said early in the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun opened his remarks by standing to apologise to family members of victims from two Boeing 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing, an examination of "Boeing's Broken Safety Culture," follows an April session of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations featuring a Boeing engineer who testified that he was punished for raising safety questions about the top-selling 787 Dreamliner and 777.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun's appearance marks his first testimony before a congressional panel since an alarming mid-flight incident in January on a 737 Max plunged the company back into crisis mode. US investigators are still probing the incident with the Alaska Airlines plane, which made an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday morning, the Senate committee detailed additional complaints from Boeing workers, including an official filing from a whistleblower who worried that Boeing's lax policies on the use of damaged or inadequate parts could "lead to a catastrophic event," according to a subcommittee memo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing stands "at a moment of reckoning and an opportunity to change a broken safety culture," said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who is chairing the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The session comes ahead of a Department of Justice determination on next steps after concluding in May that the company could be prosecuted for violating a criminal settlement following two fatal 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, off Indonesia and in Ethiopia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blumenthal said there "is near overwhelming evidence... that prosecution should be pursued."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DOJ has said it will notify a federal court of its plans by July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the April 17 hearing, witnesses painted a disturbing picture of a company that dismissed safety questions and sidelined critics as it chased faster production and bigger profits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star witness was engineer Sam Salehpour, who went public with allegations that, because of flawed manufacturing processes, the Dreamliner could suffer a potentially catastrophic accident because of excessively large gaps in the plane's assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has pointed to extensive testing that it says proves the 787 is safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun emphasised that he welcomes when workers speak out about problems, viewing such expressions as a critical component of safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pledged to get back to the committee on questions about workers who may have been fired for expressing concerns about safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun also said he would provide details on instances on how the company responds to workers who engage in retaliation against workers who speak out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In connection with the probe, Blumenthal and Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, sent a letter to Calhoun seeking records that would shed light on Salehpour's allegations about the 787 and 777, as well as records relating to Boeing's whistleblower policies and protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The same two senators also sent a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker related to the allegations, as well as other ongoing Boeing-related matters, such as a six-week FAA audit of the company following the Alaska Airlines incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate panel on Tuesday released details on additional workers who have come forward with problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This includes a new whistleblower, Sam Mohawk, who said that Boeing ordered improperly stored parts to be hidden from federal aviation inspectors, who would have demanded Boeing increase storage capacity and hire additional staff, raising costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing was attended by a small group of family members who lost relatives in the 2018 and 2019 Max crashes, which together claimed 346 lives. The group held signs with their loved ones at the outset of the session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also held a press conference just ahead of the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calhoun is a "mass killer," said Adnaan Stumo, brother to Nadia Milleron, who died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. "There needs to be criminal charges for the people at the top. The people in the driver's seat were responsible for 346 deaths, including my sister." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday morning for his first visit in 24 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit – at the invitation of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un – underscores Moscow's growing relationship with the nuclear-armed state since Russia began its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin was greeted by North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un at a welcoming ceremony at an airport in Pyongyang and the pair embraced and shook hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian leader issued a presidential order on the eve of the visit, saying Moscow was looking to sign a "comprehensive strategic partnership treaty" with North Korea, which his foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said would include security cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ushakov said the deal would not be directed against any other country, but would "outline prospects for further cooperation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will include one-on-one discussions between the two leaders, as well as a gala concert, state reception, honour guards, document signings, and a statement to the media, Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Putin's aide Ushakov as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow has said Putin will next travel to Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western countries, South Korea and Kyiv have accused Pyongyang of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, in violation of UN sanctions on North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington and Seoul say Russia has in return provided Pyongyang with technical help for its satellite programme and sent aid to the food-strapped state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has scaled down trips abroad since launching the Ukraine offensive, but has paid some high-profile visits to Moscow's key allies such as China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang rarely hosts foreign guests, isolated diplomatically and having shut itself off even more since the Covid pandemic. (Reuters/AFP)

    Black hole observed 'awakening' for the first time

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This artist’s impression shows the growing disc of material being pulled in by the black hole as it feeds on the gas available, making the galaxy light up. Image: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758034_1_20240619021538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Astronomers have been able to observe a supermassive black hole waking up and setting the heart of its host galaxy alight for the first time, the European Southern Observatory said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The galaxy 300 million light years from Earth in the Virgo constellation had been quiet for decades until late 2019, when it suddenly began to shine brighter than ever before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre of the galaxy – where a supermassive black hole is believed to be squatting – since then has been radiating a variety of rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This behaviour is unprecedented," Paula Sanchez Saez, an European Southern Observatory astronomer and first author of a new study in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "most tangible option" to explain this brightening is that the astronomers were watching "the activation of a massive black hole in real time," study co-author Lorena Hernandez Garcia said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most galaxies – including our own Milky Way – are believed to have a supermassive black hole at their centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These cosmic behemoths are by definition invisible – not even light can escape the pull of their awesome power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The only way to observe black holes is when they destroy something huge that lets off light in its death throes: such as a star that wandered too close being torn apart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These giant monsters usually are sleeping," study co-author Claudio Ricci explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for the galaxy SDSS1335+0728, "we were able to observe the awakening of the massive black hole, (which) suddenly started to feast on gas available in its surroundings, becoming very bright," the astrophysicist added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial observations indicate the black hole has 1.5 million times more mass than the Sun, enough for it to be classified as a supermassive black hole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is still on the lighter side, as the true heavyweights easily exceed a billion times the Sun's mass.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The international team of astronomers is analysing data from a number of telescopes hoping to determine whether the black hole's activity is temporary – perhaps caused by a star being ripped apart – or whether it will continue to be active for a long time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is something that could happen also to our own Sgr A*," the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, Hernandez Garcia said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But fortunately for us, our own black hole remains fast asleep. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Timberlake was arrested early on Tuesday on allegations that the singer was driving while intoxicated on New York’s Long Island, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Timberlake was released from custody later in the morning after being arraigned in Sag Harbor, on the eastern end of Long Island. He was charged with one DWI count, with his next court date scheduled for July 26, the Suffolk County district attorney’s office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake’s lawyer and representatives did not immediately return requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sag Harbor is a coastal village in the Hamptons, around 160 kilometres from New York City. In the summer, it is a hot spot for wealthy visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A young Timberlake was a Disney Mouseketeer, where his castmates included future girlfriend Britney Spears. He rose to fame in the boy band NSYNC and embarked on a solo recording career in 2002. As an actor, Timberlake has won acclaim in movies including "The Social Network” and “Friends With Benefits.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has won 10 Grammy awards and four Primetime Emmy Awards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, Timberlake was in the headlines when Spears released her memoir, “The Woman in Me.” Several chapters were devoted to their relationship, including deeply personal details about a pregnancy, abortion and painful breakup. In March, he released his first new album in six years, the nostalgic “Everything I Thought It Was,” a return to his familiar future funk sound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake has two upcoming shows in Chicago on Friday and Saturday, then is scheduled for New York's Madison Square Garden next week on Tuesday and Wednesday. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli intelligence brief prepared weeks before Hamas's October 7 attack had warned military officials of the Palestinian group's preparations for an assault, according to Israeli public broadcaster Kan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military's signals intelligence unit drafted the brief in September, less than a month before the Hamas attack that sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip, Kan reported on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the Unit 8200 intelligence document included details of elite Hamas fighters training for hostage-taking and plans for raids on military positions and Israeli communities in southern Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brief said the Palestinian militants were aiming to take hundreds of hostages, Kan reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The expected number of hostages: 200-250 people", the brief said according to Kan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unprecedented Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 251 people hostage, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 41 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive since October 7 has killed at least 37,372 people in the Gaza Strip, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Kan, citing unnamed security officials, the brief was known to intelligence officials in the military's Gaza Division and Southern Command.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli politicians have rebuffed calls for a thorough investigation into intelligence failures surrounding the Hamas attack, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted any official probe should wait until after the war, now in its ninth month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military however said it was "investigating the events" of October 7, with a probe being "actively carried out" that would later be made public. (AFP)

    'La Dolce Vita', '8 1/2' star Anouk Aimee dies at 92

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Anouk Aimee received the honorary Golden Bear award in 2003 for her lifetime achievement. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758023_1_20240618221507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anouk Aimee, the French actress whose movies included Federico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita", Jacques Demy's "Lola" and Claude Lelouch's "A Man and a Woman", has died aged 92.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We bid farewell to a world-famous icon, to a great actress of French cinema who took on roles for some of the biggest names, such as Demy, Lelouch and Fellini," said French Culture Minister Rachida Dati on social media platform X on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aimee's daughter Manuela Papatakis said in an Instagram post that Aimee had passed away at home in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her role as a lovelorn widow in "A Man and a Woman" (1966) famous for its "chabadabada, chabadabada" theme tune won her an Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe for best actress and her entry into Hollywood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aimee's elegant sophistication had already made her a star of such European masterpieces as Fellini's "La Dolce Vita" (1960) and "8 1/2" (1963), and she was unforgettable as the ageing showgirl in Jacques Demy's heartbreaking musical "Lola" (1961).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellini in particular revered her, saying her "face has the same intriguing sensuality as that of (Greta) Garbo, (Marlene) Dietrich or (Cindy) Crawford, these great mysterious queens, these priestesses of femininity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anouk Aimee represents the kind of woman who worries you to death," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That combination of "melancholy and passion" marked much of her remarkable career, with the American director Robert Altman bringing her out of retirement to rekindle her old spark with Marcello Mastroianni in the acclaimed "Pret a Porter" in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born Francoise Dreyfus in Paris on April 27, 1932, Aimee was the scion of a theatrical family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her life was turned upside down when German troops marched into the city when she was eight. Her father was Jewish, putting the family in mortal danger, even though she was raised a Catholic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We moved all the time. We hid... But then the Germans turned up and took over the apartment downstairs," she recalled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family sent her to the countryside where they hoped she would be safer, changing her name so she would not have to wear a yellow star.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her lifelong love of animals was born from the comfort they gave her during her time in hiding, she later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war over, her career began at the age of 13 when she was picked from the street to play in a Marcel Carne film that was never finished for lack of money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She finally made her screen debut the following year and adopted her character's name, Anouk, as her own. It would become popular in France thanks to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was French poet and screenwriter Jacques Prevert who convinced her to also change her surname to Aimee, meaning "loved".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her career took off in 1949 with Andre Cayatte's "The Lovers of Verona". Her class and beauty brought her a string of roles including in "Montparnasse 19" by Jacques Becker before she began to work with Demy and Fellini.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2002 she was awarded an honorary Cesar – France's Oscars – and Cannes paid tribute to her four years later. (Reuters/AFP)

 Thailand’s Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to approve a marriage equality bill, clearing the last legislative hurdle for the country to become the first in Southeast Asia to enact such a law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bill passed its final reading with the approval of 130 of the 152 members of the Senate in attendance, with four voting against it and 18 abstaining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill now needs the pro forma endorsement of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, followed by its publication in the Government Gazette, which would set a date within 120 days when it becomes effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand will become the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The marriage equality bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through the House of Representatives right before the previous parliamentary session concluded in April. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai prosecutors on Tuesday formally indicted influential former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra under the kingdom's strict royal insult laws over comments he made nearly a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thaksin, a powerful backer of the ruling government, was granted bail and avoided pre-trial detention for allegedly insulting the monarchy in a 2015 interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The billionaire sought bail from the Criminal Court of Thailand soon after the Attorney-General had formally charged him under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which carries a maximum jail sentence of up to 15 years for each perceived royal insult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin denies the charges against him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The court has released Thaksin on bail of 500,000 baht under the condition that he is prohibited from leaving the country unless granted permission," a court statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former policeman who went into the telecoms business and then entered politics, Thaksin returned to Thailand last year after 15 years in self-imposed exile following his ouster from power by a military coup in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thaksin's was the first of four high-profile cases involving key political players that were before the courts on Tuesday, in the latest legal wrangling that could see Southeast Asia's second-largest economy plunged into a new period of uncertainty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cases involve some of Thailand's most powerful politicians, including its current prime minister, and could deepen a decades-old rift between the conservative-royalist establishment and its opponents, such as the populist ruling Pheu Thai party and the opposition Move Forward party.

 Several North Korean soldiers working near the heavily fortified border with the South were wounded in a landmine explosion, the Yonhap News Agency said Tuesday, citing Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "North Korean military suffered multiple casualties due to a mine explosion during work," it said, without giving further details. The border between the two countries is heavily mined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's military said the explosions came after dozens of North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the border but retreated after Seoul's military fired warning shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the second such incursion in two weeks. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757860_1_20240618025544.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed in India on Monday when a goods train driver missed a signal and slammed into an express passenger train from behind, police and railway officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three passenger carriages were derailed and flipped on their side, while one carriage was thrust high into the air, precariously balanced on another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident in West Bengal state is the latest to hit India's creaking rail network, which carries millions of passengers each day – and the most recent reported failure of drivers missing basic signals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 people were injured and taken to hospital, Jaya Varma Sinha, chairman of India's Railway Board said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A goods train disregarded the signal and hit the train from behind," Sinha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dead included the driver and co-driver, who missed the signal, as well as a train guard and five passengers, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinha said the casualties could have been worse, but a guard wagon and two others carrying post that were attached to the back of the passenger train took the brunt of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were two parcel carriages attached... which protected other carriages from extensive damage," she said, but added that the guard wagon "was badly damaged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash took place in the Phansidewa area of Darjeeling district, when the Kanchenjunga Express train was hit by the goods train.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to "those who lost their loved ones," in a post on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called the crash "tragic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moments after the collision, she said that "ambulances and disaster teams" were rushed to the site, giving orders for "action on a war footing" to be initiated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local police officer Iftikar-Ul-Hassan said he saw several badly injured people pulled out of the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The toll could rise further, as four people are admitted in a serious condition," he said, adding that rescue teams were working to return the line to service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tracks are being cleared and restored for operations," he added. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt='French football star Kylian Mbappe says he is "against extremes and divisive ideas." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757857_1_20240618012819.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's sports minister, Amelie Oudea-Castera, on Monday hailed as exemplary a statement by football superstar Kylian Mbappe urging voters not to back extremes in snap elections called by President Emmanuel Macron to combat the far right.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mbappe, representing France at the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany, said he was "against extremes and divisive ideas" and urged young people to vote at a "crucial moment" in French history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments from Mbappe, 25, one of the icons of modern France, have sparked a stream of controversy, with figures on the right warning him against interfering in politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kylian spoke in an absolutely exemplary manner yesterday (Sunday). He wanted to speak to young people at a totally unprecedented and decisive moment for the future," of the country, said Oudea-Castera.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's men's football team has long been seen as a beacon for diversity in the country. The French Football Federation has urged against "any form of pressure and political use of the French team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope I will still be proud to wear this shirt after July 7," said Mbappe, referring to the second round of the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The striker defended comments made on Saturday by his teammate Marcus Thuram, saying he "had not gone too far" in calling on the country "to fight every day to stop" the RN winning the elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we can all see that extremists are very close to winning power and we have the opportunity to choose the future of our country," Mbappe said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, several dozen French sports personalities including tennis player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and athlete Marie-Jose Perec also called for a vote against the far right, in an op-ed for L'Equipe sports daily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We see that our athletes want to make their voices heard," added Oudea-Castera, herself a former professional tennis player, as she attended rehearsals for the Olympics opening ceremony on the River Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an attitude that is courageous, committed, and that can be applauded, that is deeply respectable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former French football star Thierry Henry, now coach of the French Olympic team, also added his voice, urging voters to "block the extremes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think there is something that is still important, what can block the extremes is to go and vote. So go and vote," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Personally, I am against anything that divides and a little more for anything that can unite," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial polls suggest the far-right National Rally (RN) may win the largest number of votes in the election but may struggle to form an overall majority. (AFP)

    Prague extradites Indian murder plot suspect to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The intended vicitm of the alleged murder plot is a Sikh separatist who supports the Khalistan movement. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757851_1_20240617234247.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech police said on Monday that an Indian citizen suspected of involvement in an alleged plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the United States had been extradited there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Justice Department charged the man, identified as Nikhil Gupta, in November with plotting to assassinate a Sikh separatist leader on US soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It alleged an Indian government official was also involved in planning the plot to kill the person, a US citizen of Indian origin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Sikhs support the Khalistan movement, that wants an independent homeland in the northern Indian province of Punjab, which Indian authorities strongly oppose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has cracked down on the movement while denying involvement in the targeting of pro-Khalistan activists outside India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The foreigner suspected in the United States of an assassination plot has been in the hands of the US judiciary since Friday," Czech police said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that Gupta was "safely extradited from a Prague airport," posting video images of the man being escorted into a plane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gupta was detained at Prague airport on June 30, 2023, under extradition orders issued by the US Justice Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said the man allegedly targeted in the killing "is a vocal critic of the Indian government and leads a US-based organisation that advocates for the secession of Punjab."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was elected to a third term this month, had vowed to "look into" the case while visiting the United States in late 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's foreign ministry has said it created a "high-level" inquiry committee to investigate the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US intelligence agencies have assessed that the plot on American soil was approved by India's top spy official at the time, Samant Goel, The Washington Post reported in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A similar case in Canada has meanwhile sparked a diplomatic row between Ottawa and New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada arrested and charged four Indian nationals in May over their alleged role in the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a separatist Sikh leader, in Vancouver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, who immigrated to Canada in 1997 and became a citizen in 2015, had advocated for a separate Sikh state of Khalistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wanted by Indian authorities for alleged "terrorism" and conspiracy to commit murder – allegations he denied – Nijjar was shot and killed on June 18, 2023, outside the Sikh temple he led in suburban Vancouver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several months later that Canada had "credible allegations" connecting Indian intelligence to the slaying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India dismissed the allegations as "absurd" and responded by briefly curbing visas for Canadians and forcing Ottawa to withdraw diplomats. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to North Korea on Tuesday for a "friendly" visit, the Kremlin announced, as the West suspects Pyongyang of supplying Moscow with weapons for its Ukraine offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit to the world's most reclusive state comes as Putin seeks ammunition to continue his military campaign launched in February 2022, which has thrown Moscow into unprecedented global isolation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also comes nine months after Putin hosted North Korea's Kim Jong Un on a rare foreign trip to the Russian Far East, where the pair lavished each other with praise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Vladimir Putin on June 18-19 will go to the North Korean Democratic Republic on a friendly state visit," the Kremlin said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow said Putin will then travel to Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western countries, South Korea and Kyiv have accused Pyongyang of sending weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine, in violation of UN sanctions on North Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington and Seoul say Russia has in return provided Pyongyang with technical help for its satellite programme and sent aid to the food-strapped state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin has scaled down trips abroad since launching the Ukraine offensive, but has paid some high-profile visits to Moscow's few key allies such as China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang rarely hosts foreign guests, isolated diplomatically and having shut itself off even more since the Covid pandemic. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his country's six-member war cabinet, in a widely expected move that came after the departure from government of the centrist former general Benny Gantz.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was now expected to hold consultations about the Gaza war with a small group of ministers, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer who had been in the war cabinet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister had faced demands from the nationalist-religious partners in his coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to be included in the war cabinet, a move which would have intensified strains with international partners including the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forum was formed after Gantz joined Netanyahu in a national unity government at the start of the Gaza war in October and also included Gantz's partner Gadi Eisenkot and Aryeh Deri, head of the religious party Shas, as observers. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South African former president Jacob Zuma said on Sunday his new party would join an opposition alliance to coordinate resistance to the government, while maintaining its challenge to the general election results.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The 2024 elections were rigged" the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party spokesman Nhlamulo Ndhlela said, reading out a statement on behalf of the 82-year-old ex-leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have instructed our legal team to take any steps possible both inside of South Africa and internationally to ensure that justice is done."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he added: "At the right time we will call on our people to demonstrate their dissatisfaction against all these injustices peacefully, in the streets, in the court and even in parliament until our grievances are addressed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MK also said it would join a newly formed parliamentary grouping that includes several mostly leftist opposition parties represented in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Called the "Progressive Caucus" it is currently led by the radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which won 39 seats in the new parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuma, a stern expression on his face, sat quietly as his speech was read out, occasionally answering questions from the press.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MK came third in the election, winning 14.6 percent of the vote and 58 parliamentary seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the party boycotted the country's first parliamentary sitting where Zuma's long-term political foe Cyril Ramaphosa was re-elected as president for a second term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party announced it had launched a fresh court bid to dispute the "rigged" election results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had already gone to court to try to prevent the new parliament from convening, and lodged a separate complaint over alleged election irregularities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other parties have also complained to the country's electoral body and lodged legal complaints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa, who will be inaugurated on June 19, will lead what he calls a government of national unity after the May poll produced no outright winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national unity government includes the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and other smaller groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deal got a frosty reception from the opposition parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndhlela for the MK denounced the new coalition as a "white-led unholy alliance" that "must be crushed before it finds its feet." He accused the ANC of going to "bed with the racists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EFF dismissed the idea of working with rivals holding radically different political views, such as the DA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zuma has been a bitter rival of Ramaphosa's ever since he was ousted by his own party, the African National Congress (ANC), under a cloud of corruption allegations in 2018 and replaced by Rampaphosa. (AFP)
