<div class="itemFullText">
 A small evening vigil was held on Sunday for the six people killed in a knife attack at a busy Sydney shopping centre, which police said was carried out by a local man with a history of mental illness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mourners gathered in silent reflection outside the Westfield mall in Bondi Junction, which had been packed with weekend shoppers when 40-year-old itinerant Joel Cauchi went on a stabbing rampage on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said five women and a Pakistani security guard were killed in the attack, which lasted for about half an hour, until a solo policewoman tracked down Cauchi and shot him dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Inspector Amy Scott was hailed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a "hero" who "no doubt" had "saved lives through her action."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among Cauchi's victims were a designer, a volunteer surf lifesaver, the daughter of an entrepreneur, and a new mother whose nine-month-old baby is still in hospital with serious stab wounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As night fell on Sunday, a group of about 40 people from a local Muslim association placed flowers on the ever-growing pile outside the shopping centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They remembered 30-year-old Faraz Tahir, who had been working as a security guard when he was stabbed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They stood for a minute of silence with their hands clasped, heads bowed and eyes fixated on the flowers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mourners then raised their hands in a moment of prayer. Many wiped away tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australians, largely unaccustomed to violent crime, are still coming to terms with an attack that shattered a city better known for its famed beaches and laid-back bars and restaurants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On any given weekend the Westfield shopping centre is packed with people shopping for clothes or groceries, with families grabbing a bite to eat or a movie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Health officials said it would take many eyewitnesses a lifetime to come to terms with what they saw and felt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sound of people screaming was horrific," said one eyewitness, Daphi Kiselstein, who was shopping at the time of the attack and took refuge in a store with other terrified shoppers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite early social media reports falsely linking the attack to events in the Middle East, New South Wales police Assistant Commissioner Anthony Cooke said there was no evidence that Cauchi was "driven by any particular motivation, ideology or otherwise."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said he was diagnosed with a mental health issue at age 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a pained statement, Cauchi's parents offered thoughts for the victims and said their son's actions were "truly horrific."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still trying to comprehend what has happened. He has battled with mental health issues since he was a teenager."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parents also sent a message to the officer who shot their son dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was only doing her job to protect others and we hope she is coping alright," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cauchi is believed to have travelled to Sydney about a month ago and hired a small storage unit in the city, according to police. It contained personal belongings, including a boogie board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had been living in a vehicle and hostels, and was only in sporadic contact with his family via text messages, his parents said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Facebook profile said Cauchi came from Toowoomba, near Brisbane, and had attended a local high school and university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A distinctive grey, red and yellow dragon tattoo on his right arm was used to help identify him. (AFP)

    HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    Six arrests over US$16mn Air Canada gold heist

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Canada and the United States have arrested six people and are seeking three others in connection with the theft of over C$22 million (US$16 million) in gold and cash from an Air Canada cargo facility last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In what authorities described as the largest gold heist in Canadian history, suspects including an Air Canada employee forged an airway bill to steal the cargo that had arrived in Toronto from Zurich in April 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cargo contained 6,600 gold bars weighing 400 kilograms, worth over C$20 million, and C$2.5 million in foreign currency, the Peel regional police told reporters at a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects have been hit with more than 19 charges by the authorities, who recovered one kilogram of gold and approximately C$434,000 in Canadian currency, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stolen gold may have been melted and reconstituted, making it difficult to track down, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police also recovered some 65 firearms that investigators allege were purchased from the proceeds of the theft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that they've melted down the gold and then the profits they got from the gold, they use to help finance the firearms," Detective Sergeant Mike Mavity said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five suspects were arrested in Canada and conditionally released. One suspect, originally from Brampton, Ontario, was arrested in Pennsylvania along with the firearms and remains in custody in the United States. Canada-wide warrants have been issued for the remaining three suspects, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the heist, Miami-based transport and security services provider Brinks sued Air Canada in October, alleging "negligence and carelessness" by the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brinks had been hired by Swiss bank Raiffeisen Schweiz and precious metals refining company Valcambi to move the valuables from Switzerland to Canada. (Reuters)

    Crowds join Bondi Beach memorial for stabbing victims

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hundreds of people sat in a beachside park to light candles for the six victims. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749905_1_L_20240422023522.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds gathered at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Sunday for a candlelight memorial to the six people killed by a knife-wielding assailant at a nearby shopping mall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Many hundreds sat on the grass in a beachside park to grieve for the five women and a Pakistani male security guard who died in the April 13 attack at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killings stunned many Australians who are largely unaccustomed to such violent crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I heard this I cried. Because it is new to us. We don't have this happen often. It's a shock," said 56-year-old local cafe owner Daniela Pontidas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know a lot of people that were impacted in some way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel like this has burst Australia's bubble a bit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Inggall, 50, said he had been at Bondi Junction in the morning hours before the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These things don't happen often in Australia but when they do I think they have a profound impact," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it really moves the community, so I want to be a part of it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mentally ill knifeman, 40-year-old Joel Cauchi, was tracked down, shot and killed by police inspector Amy Scott, who attended the service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As waves crashed into the beach at dusk, a choir sang the hymn "Keep Your Loving Arms Around Me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Indigenous didgeridoo was played as people lit candles in the breezy evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Bondi is tough and this is a strong community, and we will get through this," said New South Wales Premier Chris Minns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese offered the condolences of the nation for the six lives "snatched away on that hardest of Saturday afternoons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We mourn for all the joy they should have known," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cauchi's parents say he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17 but stopped taking medication, later leaving their Queensland home and dropping out of treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His women victims were a designer, a volunteer surf lifesaver, the daughter of an entrepreneur, a Chinese university student, and a new mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old mother, Ashlee Good, handed over her bleeding nine-month-old girl Harriet to two strangers in desperation before being rushed to hospital where she died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The baby was also taken to hospital and is said to be doing well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shopping mall reopened for business on Friday in a sombre mood, with floral tributes to the dead piled up inside and shoppers stopping to sign a book of condolence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian leaders have praised the "heroes" of the Bondi attack, including the police and emergency responders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has granted permanent citizenship to Frenchman Damien Guerot who fended off the attacker with a bollard; and it is expected to do the same for wounded Pakistani security guard Muhammad Taha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the rarity of such crimes, two days after the mall attack an Assyrian Christian bishop was brutally stabbed during a livestreamed service in western Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bishop has said he is recovering in hospital. A 16-year-old suspect has been charged with committing "a terrorist act." (AFP)

    World urges restraint after Iran's attack on Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="G7 leaders discuss the Iranian attack on Israel during a video meeting. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748865_1_L_20240415011324.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders urged restraint on Sunday after Iran launched an unprecedented wave of missiles and attack drones against its arch foe Israel overnight, at a time the Gaza war has inflamed Middle East tensions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Iran launched the attack, its first ever to directly target Israeli territory, in retaliation for a deadly air strike widely blamed on Israel that destroyed its consular building in Syria's capital early this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and its allies intercepted the vast majority of the incoming projectiles, the Israeli army said, reporting 12 people injured and no deaths, but the attack sharply heightened fears of an Israeli counterstrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  G7 leaders condemned Iran's unprecedented attack and called for "restraint" on all sides, European Council President Charles Michel wrote on X following a video conference and ahead of a planned 2000 GMT meeting of the UN Security Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue all our efforts to work towards de-escalation. Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate ceasefire, will make a difference."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's top ally the United States also urged caution and calm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't want to see this escalate," White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told NBC. "We're not looking for a wider war with Iran."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden reaffirmed "ironclad" US support for Israel, but also appeared to guide its ally away from a military response against their common adversary Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News outlet Axios reported that Biden had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he should "take the win" and that Washington would oppose an Israeli counterattack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Tehran attacked, Israel's military had warned Iran it would suffer the "consequences for choosing to escalate the situation any further."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu was on Sunday meeting his war cabinet, put in place amid the Gaza conflict sparked by the October 7 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Through the night, air raid sirens wailed and Israeli citizens sought cover in bunkers and shelters, as missile defence systems and fighter-jets intercepted drones and missiles in the night skies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday warned Israel against a "reckless" retaliation, warning that this would spark "a decisive and much stronger response."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's mission to the United Nations also warned Washington to keep out of its conflict with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added in a message on X that "the matter can be deemed concluded." (AFP)

    Fire sweeps through historic Copenhagen landmark

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Firefighters attempt to tackle the blaze at Copenhagen's stock exchange. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749195_1_L_20240417003345.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire ripped through Copenhagen's Old Stock Exchange, one of the Danish capital's most famous landmarks, on Tuesday, engulfing its spire which collapsed in a scene reminiscent of the 2019 blaze at Paris' Notre-Dame Cathedral.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Emergency services, employees from the Danish Chamber of Commerce, including its CEO Brian Mikkelsen, and even passers-by were seen carrying large paintings away from the building in a race to save historic artefacts from the flames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video showed the flaming spire breaking in half as it tumbled down, sending a large part crashing to the ground next to a fire truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everybody is crying at the Danish Chamber of Commerce right now. It's their workplace, but also their history," Mikkelsen told reporters, shaking his head in disbelief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's our cultural heritage that I'm looking at. It's 400 years that have shaped Danish cultural history and the society we live in today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Denmark's National Museum sent 25 employees to the scene to help evacuate cultural artefacts and paintings, it said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video from local media showed people sitting on the ground outside the building, looking through paper catalogues listing and depicting the artefacts inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are saving everything we possibly can," Copenhagen fire department chief Jakob Vedsted Andersen told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the works saved were paintings by Denmark's Peder Severin Kroyer, a renowned 19th century impressionist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescued items would be sent to Denmark's National Museum for examination, its head of collection storage and curation Camilla Jul Bastholm told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The historic building, whose spire was shaped as the tails of four dragons intertwined, had been under renovation and clad in scaffolding when the fire broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of the roof had collapsed and the fire spread to several floors of the building, the fire service said, adding the firefighting operation would continue through the night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no reports of injuries, police said, and it was not immediately clear what caused the blaze. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man has died after setting himself on fire outside the New York courthouse where former US president Donald Trump’s hush-money trial was taking place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police identified the man as Max Azzarello, from Florida, who was rushed to hospital in critical condition after police on the scene tried to extinguish the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was later pronounced dead by the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not clear whether the self-immolation had anything to do with Trump's case, but the gruesome incident occurred on the street outside the building where the ex-president and current White House hopeful sat on the 15th floor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shocking development came shortly after jury selection for the trial was completed, clearing the way for prosecutors and defence attorneys to make opening statements on Monday in a case stemming from hush money paid to a porn star. The court adjourned later in the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12 jurors, along with six alternates, will consider evidence in a first-ever trial to determine whether a former US president is guilty of breaking the law. Prosecutors intend to call at least 20 witnesses, according to Trump defence lawyer Susan Necheles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of business fraud as part of a scheme to cover up hush money paid to a porn star so that the story would not come out just before the 2016 presidential election, in which he beat Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, he could face prison but would more likely be fined. (Agencies)

 Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday announced he would step down as premier on May 15 and hand over power to his successor Lawrence Wong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong, 51, is currently the deputy prime minister and finance minister of Singapore, and has been prime minister-in-waiting since 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted on the website of the Prime Minister's Office, Lee called the leadership transition a "significant moment".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will relinquish my role as Prime Minister on 15 May 2024 and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will be sworn in as the next Prime Minister on the same day. Lawrence and...team have worked hard to gain the people's trust, notably during the pandemic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An election is expected to follow in the months after the handover of power.

    At least five die trying to cross English Channel

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least five people have died while attempting to cross the English Channel, according to French authorities, hours after Britain approved its migrant deportation bill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The regional Voix du Nord newspaper said the bodies were discovered at the Wimereaux beach in northern France on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local officials said about 110 migrants were crowded onto a small boat when panic broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither local authorities nor the coast guard could say how many people had been rescued or could be missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coast guard was still carrying out search-and-rescue operations at sea, a spokesperson said, after what the official called a "busy" morning, with several crossing attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reports of the deaths came only hours after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s latest effort to send some migrants on a one-way ticket to Rwanda finally won approval from Parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UK government plans to deport some of those who enter the country illegally as a deterrent to migrants who risk their lives in hopes they will be able to claim asylum once they reach Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Human rights groups have described the legislation as inhumane and cruel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the United Nations refugee agency and the Council of Europe called on Britain to rethink its plans for fears they could damage international cooperation on tackling the global migrant crisis. (Agencies)

    First Ukraine aid to arrive in hours: Biden

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law on Wednesday that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, notching a rare bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks reelection and ending months of wrangling with Republicans in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves from threats to their sovereignty," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill includes US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine and US$26 billion for Israel, as well as $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of the legislation was immediate. Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden blamed "MAGA Republicans" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin," he said. (Reuters)

    Snake on a train delays Japanese bullet service

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Even small delays in Japan's much-vaunted bullet trains are rare, and more unusual still are snakes on board holding up the speedy "shinkansen" services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday evening, a passenger alerted security to a 40-centimetre serpent lurking on a train between Nagoya and Tokyo, resulting in a 17-minute hold-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear whether the cold-blooded commuter was venomous or how it ended up on the train, and there was no injury or panic among passengers, a spokesman for Central Japan Railway Company said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shinkansen customers can bring small dogs, cats and other animals, including pigeons on board – but not snakes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's difficult to imagine wild snakes somehow climbing onto the train at one of the stations. We have rules against bringing snakes into the shinkansen," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But we don't check passengers' baggage," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The train was originally scheduled to go on to Osaka, but the company decided to use a different train for the trip, causing a delay of about 17 minutes, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patrols by uniformed security guards onboard bullet trains were scaled up after a fatal stabbing in 2018 on a shinkansen that shocked normally ultra-safe Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additional security was added for the Olympics in 2021 and Group of Seven meetings last year. (AFP)

    France hosts Sudan talks a year into 'forgotten' war

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The conference is being co-hosted by Germany and the European Union. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749036_1_L_20240415232828.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France and its allies on Monday sought to drum up hundreds of millions in aid for Sudan a year since civil war erupted, sparking one of the world's worst and most under-funded humanitarian crises.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of people have been killed and 8.5 million more forced to flee their homes since fighting broke out on April 15 last year between rival generals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sudan is experiencing "one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory," with more people displaced inside the country than anywhere else in the world and a fast-growing hunger crisis, the United Nations says.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the conference in Paris, France is seeking contributions from the international community and attention to a crisis that officials say is being crowded out of the global conversation by conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For a year the Sudanese people have been the victims of a terrible war," French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said. Yet they had also suffered from "being forgotten" and "indifference."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the reason for our meetings today: to break the silence surrounding this conflict and mobilise the international community," he said in opening remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conference, co-hosted by Germany and the European Union, was to include a ministerial meeting on political matters as well as a humanitarian meeting to raise funds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aid workers say a year of war has led to a catastrophe, but the world has turned away from the country of 48 million as conflict rages between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only five percent of the 3.8-billion-euro (US$4.1 billion) target in the UN's latest humanitarian appeal had been funded ahead of the conference this year, according to France's foreign ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the opening, a total of 840 million euros (US$895 million) had been pledged after announcements from France, Germany, the European Union and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A diplomatic source, asking not to be named, said total donations could well top "a billion euros" by the end of the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the fifth anniversary of a fire that ravaged the French capital's Notre Dame cathedral, Save the Children contrasted the lack of donations for Sudan with the international response to the Paris blaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is staggering that after a fire in which nobody died, donors from across the world were so moved to pledge funds to restore Notre Dame," said the charity's country director in Sudan, Arif Noor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, children in Sudan are left to fend for themselves as war rages around them, starvation and disease are on the increase and almost the entire country's child population has been out of school for a year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen million children need humanitarian assistance to survive, Save the Children says.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Will Carter, Sudan country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, civilians in Sudan are "enduring starvation, mass sexual violence, large-scale ethnic killing, and executions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Millions more are displaced, and yet the world continues to look the other way," he said earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An estimated 1.8 million people have fled Sudan – many to neighbouring Chad, now also suffering a humanitarian crisis – and 6.7 million have been internally displaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Human Rights Watch says warring parties have blocked access for humanitarian assistance, pillaged foreign financial aid and targeted humanitarian workers in attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the UN's food agency warned the world should not wait for famine to be officially declared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our goal now is to be able to get in... About 90 percent of the population can't be reached right now," WFP director Cindy McCain said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we start talking about is there famine, is there not famine, the truth is we don't know because we can't get in."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministerial meeting, behind closed doors, brings together representatives from Sudan's neighbours, as well as from Gulf nations and Western powers, including the United States and Britain, along with regional organisations and the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock lamented the failure of mediation efforts so far and urged "better coordination."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chad's Foreign Minister Mahamat Saleh Annadif urged "pressure for there to be an immediate ceasefire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we continue like this, in a year's time, Sudan risks disintegrating," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea on Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of the country's worst maritime disaster, when hundreds of schoolchildren died after the overloaded Sewol ferry capsized and sank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The disaster and botched rescue efforts dealt a crushing blow to then-president Park Geun-hye, who was eventually impeached in 2017, and the tragedy remains divisive and politically sensitive in South Korea even now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Coast Guard vessel took some of the victims' families to the site of the sinking early Tuesday for a special ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the site off South Korea's south coast -- marked by a yellow buoy -- the families called out the names of the deceased and threw flowers into the water, followed by a moment of silence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People say: 'It's been 10 years, bury it (in your memory)'" Park Jeong-hwa, whose daughter Cho Eun-jung was among the 304 people killed in the tragedy, said ahead of the anniversary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I was going to be able to do it, thinking maybe after 10 years, the pain would fade a bit. But instead, it's even more painful now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Yoon Suk-yeol, whose party was dealt a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections last week, offered his condolences to the families of victims at a Tuesday cabinet meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though 10 years have passed, the events of April 16, 2014, remain vivid in my memory," he said. (AFP)

    S Korean doctors reject govt proposal to end strike

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The strike, which began on February 20, has forced hospitals to cancel essential treatments and surgeries. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749794_1_L_20240421023012.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's leading doctors' body on Saturday rejected a revised medical reform plan from the government, the initial version of which sparked a strike two months ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing walkout by thousands of trainee doctors has caused chaos in South Korean hospitals, and is in response to a plan to boost annual admissions to medical schools by 2,000 from next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Friday offered its first concession, allowing 32 universities to admit as few as 1,000 medical students instead of the initially proposed 2,000 – but the Korean Medical Association (KMA) said the plan must be abandoned entirely within a week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since this is not a fundamental solution, the emergency committee of the Korean Medical Association clearly states that it cannot accept it," Kim Sung-geun, a KMA spokesperson, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the sake of our country's future and to protect the health of patients currently suffering, we ask the president... to discuss this again from square one."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim said "one week is left" to find a solution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government claims its plan will alleviate doctor shortages for an ageing society, but medical professionals and trainees say it will diminish the quality of education and healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strike, which began on February 20, has forced hospitals to cancel essential treatments and surgeries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On top of the trainee doctors, who play a key role in emergency procedures and surgeries at general hospitals, more than 50 percent of the country's medical students have also filed for a leave of absence, according to the education ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The KMA warned that if the government does not relent, medical students will likely be forced to repeat a year, senior doctors at general hospitals will start to resign on April 25, and the healthcare system could "collapse."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government's Friday offer came after President Yoon Suk-yeol's conservative ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initially, there was public sympathy for the government, but polls leading up to the April 10 election indicated that the mood had shifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 60 percent of people surveyed in a Dong-A Ilbo poll said the government should adjust the scale and timing of its reform plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main opposition Democratic Party has also criticised Yoon and urged him to revise the reform plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had previously warned of legal consequences if doctors did not return to work, and suspended the medical licences of two KMA officials purportedly for instigating the walkout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Proponents of the plan say opposing doctors are simply trying to safeguard their salaries and social status. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape says his nation does not deserve to be labelled cannibals, and urged the US to clear up the remnants of the Second World War littered across the Pacific, after comments by President Joe Biden about his missing serviceman uncle.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden had "appeared to imply his uncle was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down over PNG during WWII", Marape's office said in a statement late on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Biden's remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labelled as such," Marape said in the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I urge President Biden to get the White House to look into cleaning up these remains of WWII so the truth about missing servicemen like Ambrose Finnegan can be put to rest."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has previously cited his personal connection with Papua New Guinea's wartime history on visits to Australia, telling the story of his uncle who died in a plane crash in May 1944.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden last week raised the possibility his uncle might have fallen victim to cannibals, after visiting a missing-in-action war memorial in Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historians say Papua New Guinea was crucial to the United States drive across the Pacific to liberate the Philippines in the Second World War, while Australia has said the wartime history showed the renewed strategic importance of its northern neighbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of the war remains sensitive among Pacific Islanders, however. Marape said his nation was "needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands remain littered with wartime human remains, plane wrecks, ship wrecks and tunnels, as well as leftover bombs which were still killing people, he said. (Reuters)

    Hindu nationalist Modi the favourite as India votes

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749580_1_L_20240419111212.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India began voting on Friday in a six-week election with an all but assured victory for Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as a weakened opposition is pushed to the sidelines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A total of 968 million people are eligible to take part in the world's biggest vote – a staggering logistical exercise that critics say follows a concerted effort to delegitimise rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A long and winding queue was patiently assembled outside a polling station in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges river, even before the booths opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am here because I am happy about the direction the country is headed," said autorickshaw driver Ganga Singh, 27. "I will vote keeping in mind not personal welfare but the country's prosperity."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, 73, remains resoundingly popular after a decade in office that has seen India rise as an economic power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I urge all those voting... to exercise their franchise in record numbers," he wrote in a social media post on X as the election began. "Every vote counts and every voice matters!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi has already led the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party through two landslide victories in 2014 and 2019, forged in large part by his appeals to the Hindu faithful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His prospects have been further bolstered by several criminal probes into his opponents and a tax investigation this year that froze the bank accounts of Congress, India's largest opposition party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposition figures and human rights organisations have accused Modi's government of orchestrating the probes to weaken rivals. (AFP)

    Fourteen dead in Israeli West Bank raid

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Palestinian Red Crescent said on Saturday at least 14 people had been killed in an Israeli raid on Nur Shams refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli army said troops had killed 10 militants during the operation, which it said started on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AFP journalists saw bodies in the streets and houses hit by blasts as Israeli drones flew overhead and armoured vehicles moved through the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since early last year, violence has flared in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. It has escalated further since war broke out in Gaza on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, our crews have evacuated 14 martyrs from Nur Shams camp to the hospital," the Palestinian Red Crescent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Palestinian health ministry said it had confirmed 11 injured in the Israeli raid, seven of them "wounded by live gunshots". Among them was a paramedic shot while trying to get to the wounded, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medics had been alerted to "a number of killed and injured" inside the camp, but the army was "denying them access to tend to the wounded", the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An AFP journalist said paramedics had tried to enter the camp but had been refused access by the army. Gunshots rang out and soldiers carried out door-to-door raids, the journalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, in Gaza, Palestinian emergency services said on Sunday that  they have uncovered a mass grave with 50 bodies at the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The discovery comes after the Israeli military withdrew its troops from the southern city on April 7 - Much of the city is now in ruins after months of relentless Israeli bombardment and heavy fighting. (Agencies)

    Trump jury gets master class on burying negative press

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker told the NY court how he would suppress negative stories about Donald Trump. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750251_1_L_20240424035636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A colourful former tabloid publisher took the witness stand on Tuesday at Donald Trump's "hush money" trial and described how he suppressed negative stories about the real estate tycoon, a practice known as "catch and kill."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels over a 2006 sexual encounter that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors allege that Trump engaged in "election fraud" by having his then personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to the adult film actress on the eve of the 2016 election in which he defeated Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  David Pecker, 72, former publisher of the National Enquirer, was the first witness called to testify by prosecutors at Trump's high-stakes trial, which comes less than seven months ahead of his expected rematch against President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors are seeking with Pecker's testimony to demonstrate that the "catch and kill" scheme of squashing negative stories was one commonly used by Trump and Cohen, the once loyal "fixer" who has since turned against his former boss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker took the stand after a nearly 90-minute hearing during which Judge Juan Merchan was asked by prosecutors to hold Trump in contempt of court for violating a partial gag order preventing him from publicly attacking witnesses, jurors or court staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan heard arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys but did not issue an immediate ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he has known Trump since 1989 and described him as a friend – "I would call him Donald."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said National Enquirer readers "loved" Trump, who starred in the hit reality television series "The Apprentice" before going into politics in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he agreed at an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower with Trump, Cohen and Trump's personal assistant Hope Hicks to help his friend's nascent campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I said what I would do is, I would run or publish positive stories about Mr Trump and I would publish negative stories about his opponents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said he would also warn Cohen about potential negative stories about Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I notified Michael Cohen of a story that was a negative story, he would try to vet it himself, see if the story was true or not," Pecker said. "And he would go to the individual publication to make sure the story wasn't published and get it killed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors walked Pecker through two payments made to squash negative stories. One involved a Trump Tower doorman who was peddling a false claim that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other involved a former Playboy magazine model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with the married Trump. She was paid US$150,000 not to go public with the story.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker is to return to the witness stand when the trial resumes on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Pecker testified, prosecutors – at a hearing held without the jury present – accused Trump of brazenly violating the gag order imposed by the judge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's "willful" attacks on witnesses "clearly violate" the gag order, prosecutor Chris Conroy said, urging the judge to fine him US$1,000 per violation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not yet seeking an incarceratory penalty," Conroy said, but the court should "remind him that incarceration is an option should it be necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and Cohen are both expected to appear as prosecution witnesses at the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has repeatedly attacked them on Truth Social, calling them, for example, "sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our country dearly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lashed out at the judge following the day's proceedings, calling the gag order "unconstitutional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not allowed to talk but people are allowed to talk about me," he said. "They can lie but I'm not allowed to say anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He complained that Biden is "out campaigning and I'm here in the courtroom."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very unfair situation." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK readied on Tuesday to start detaining migrants within days for deportation to Rwanda after the controversial plan got parliament's approval, sparking outrage from the UN and rights groups.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new legislation – a flagship policy of the Conservative government that aims to curb irregular cross-Channel migration from northern France – cleared its final hurdle after a marathon late-night parliamentary tussle on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just hours later French police said at least five migrants, including a child, died overnight during an attempt to cross the busy shipping lane in a small boat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the UK scheme, undocumented asylum seekers arriving in Britain would be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be examined and, if approved, would allow them to stay in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says deportations are expected to begin within 10-12 weeks, with migrants identified for the first flight due to be detained and held from as early as this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rwanda said it was "pleased" to see the bill passed and was looking forward to "welcoming those relocated to Rwanda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the heads of the UN agencies for refugees and human rights warned it threatened the rule of law and set "a perilous precedent globally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged the UK to instead "take practical measures to address irregular flows of refugees and migrants, based on international cooperation and respect for international human rights law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Council of Europe also called for the new law to be scrapped and said it raised "major issues about the human rights of asylum seekers and the rule of law more generally." (AFP)

    Nato head urges G7 countries to do more for Ukraine

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a G7 meeting on Thursday that Ukraine had an "urgent, critical need for more air defence", as Kyiv's foreign minister pressed allies for more Patriot systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven developed nations, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, are gathering on the Italian island of Capri from Wednesday to Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba joined counterparts from Italy, the UK, the US, Japan, Canada, France and Germany for a working session dedicated to the conflict on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kuleba called for other countries to follow Germany, which at the weekend said it was sending an additional Patriot air defence system to Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work here at the ministerial (meeting) to make other allies deliver air-defence systems to Ukraine, because it's of fundamental importance," Kuleba told reporters ahead of the session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has said it is running out of weaponry to shoot down Russian missiles and drones as Moscow has ramped up its attacks on infrastructure across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said there had been "important, encouraging signs" of new support from NATO allies, including the scheduling of a US Congressional vote this weekend on a long-stalled aid package.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's of vital importance that Nato allies sustain and step up their support... There's an urgent, critical need for more air defence," Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Blinken stressed the need for the US Congress to agree to the new aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this moment, it is urgent that all of the friends and supporters of Ukraine maximise their efforts to provide... Ukraine with what it needs to continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kubela said the help would "literally, without exaggeration, help save Ukrainians from Russian missile slaughter".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a matter of death and life."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the day's talks, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani -- whose country holds the rotating G7 presidency this year -- said allies had confirmed "our maximum commitment" to Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed ministers discussed the potential use of Russian assets frozen after the February 2022 invasion to help Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are evaluating (the idea) in principle, we are also in favour of using the seized assets, but we need the legal basis to do so," Tajani said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British Foreign Secretary David Cameron called earlier in Capri for "creative" way of using the assets, saying it was "important we try and get agreement" on how.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been mounting calls in Washington and Europe to set up a fund for Ukraine using billions of dollars in Russian bank accounts, investments and other assets frozen by the West after the invasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU froze some 200 billion euros of Russian central bank assets held in the bloc as part of sanctions on Moscow. (AFP)

    Boeing reports Q1 loss amid ongoing crisis

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato countries have agreed to give Ukraine more air defences after desperate pleas from Kyiv for advanced systems to shoot down Russian attacks, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Nato defence ministers have agreed to step up and provide further military support, including more air defence," Stoltenberg said after virtual talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nato has mapped out existing capabilities across the alliance and there are systems that can be made available to Ukraine," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I expect new announcements on air defence capabilities for Ukraine soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has been urgently calling on its Western backers to send more air defences as it has struggled to fend off a surge in Russian attacks on its infrastructure in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has above all been calling for more US-designed Patriot systems that are capable of shooting down Russian hypersonic missiles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said there were Patriot and also Franco-Italian SAMP/T systems available in stocks of Nato countries that can be given to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he could not say whether Nato defence ministers had made concrete commitments during the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany earlier this week announced it was giving Ukraine an additional Patriot system, on top of two already supplied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials say that the United States, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Greece, Romania and Poland are the Nato countries with Patriot systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US lawmakers will vote on Saturday on a long-stalled US$61-billion aid package for Ukraine that allies hope will reopen support from Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I count on the bill to pass without further delay," Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hold-up in support from Washington and struggles by Europe to find enough weaponry have left outgunned Ukrainian forces struggling to hold back Moscow's troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said that ministers also discussed Kyiv's "many other pressing needs", including artillery shells, longer range missiles and drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Each NATO ally will decide what to provide. Several allies made concrete commitments during the meeting and are finalising contributions that I expect will be announced soon," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said on Monday the chief of its intelligence directorate has resigned after taking responsibility for failures leading to the unprecedented October 7 attack by Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Major General Aharon Haliva is the first high-ranking official to step down for failing to prevent the attack that shocked Israel and the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Major General Aharon Haliva, in coordination with the chief of the general staff, has requested to end his position, following his leadership responsibility as the head of the intelligence directorate for the events of October 7," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was decided that MG Aharon Haliva will end his position and retire from the IDF (army), once his successor is appointed in an orderly and professional process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his resignation letter, Haliva, who served in the force for 38 years, took responsibility for failing to prevent the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On Saturday, October 7th 2023, Hamas committed a deadly surprise attack against the state of Israel," he wrote in the letter, a copy of which was given to journalists by the military.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The intelligence division under my command did not live up to the task we were entrusted with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I carry that black day with me ever since. Day after day, night after night. I will forever carry with me the terrible pain of the war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his letter, Haliva called for a "thorough investigation into factors and circumstances" that led to the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas and is engaged in a blistering assault against the militant group which rules the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian territory's health ministry said 34,097 people have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza, most of them women and children. (AFP)

    Chinese woman, 25, named as sixth Sydney attack victim

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese woman studying in Australia was one of six people killed when a 40-year-old knifeman rampaged through a Sydney shopping centre at the weekend, the prime minister said Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yixuan Cheng, the last of the victims to be identified from Saturday's attack, "has lost her life," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a radio interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Australian police said the attacker may have targeted women, as the country mourned the victims and hundreds of people laid flowers near the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the attack on Saturday, five of the six people killed and the majority of the 12 injured were women. Police said on Monday they had finished taking physical evidence at the Westfield Bondi Junction mall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's obvious to me, it's obvious to detectives that seems to be an area of interest that the offender focused on women and avoided the men," New South Wales state Police Commissioner Karen Webb told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The videos speak for themselves, don't they? That's certainly a line for inquiry for us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses described how attacker Joel Cauchi, 40, wearing shorts and an Australian national rugby league jersey, ran through the mall with a knife. He was killed by Inspector Amy Scott, who confronted him solo while he was on the rampage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have said Cauchi had mental health issues in the past and there was no indication ideology was a motive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violent crimes such as Saturday's stabbing are rare in the country of about 27 million people, which has some of the world's toughest gun and knife laws. (AFP/Reuters)

    Seven killed at Sri Lanka motor race

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least seven people were killed and another 21 wounded when a race car ploughed into spectators at a packed motorsport event hosted by Sri Lanka's army on Sunday, police said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A driver crashed into the crowd on an unprotected stretch of the track at the Fox Hill circuit, which is maintained by the Sri Lankan army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video shared widely on social media showed track marshals waving yellow flags to warn other drivers to slow down after a car overturned on the track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drivers are seen speeding past in clouds of orange dust until a red car slams into the crowd, and people are heard screaming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 27 people were taken to hospital and seven of them succumbed to their injuries," spokesman Nihal Thalduwa said, adding that an eight-year-old girl was among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shortly before the crash, army chief Vikum Liyanage announced that the gates had been opened to spectators free of charge to promote motorsports, with the event being held for the first time in five years due to the Covid pandemic and the island's economic crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is a very special day... we decided to allow anyone to come in free," Liyanage said, claiming that about 100,000 spectators were at the Fox Hill circuit, around 180 kilometres east of Colombo. (AFP)

    Bill to ban TikTok in US clears Congress
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750299_1_L_20240424111040.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)

    Trump in NY court for start of criminal trial

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750038_1_L_20240422232243.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former US president Donald Trump arrived in court on Monday for opening statements in his criminal trial and condemned the high-stakes case as a "witch hunt" designed to derail his White House bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It's a very, very sad day in America," the 77-year-old Republican presidential candidate told reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, and lots of other places campaigning," he said. "This is a witch hunt and it's a shame and it comes out of Washington."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges and the case poses substantial risks to him less than seven months before his election rematch with President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecution witnesses are expected to include adult film actress Stormy Daniels – who says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, a claim he denies – and Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The identities of the jury's five women and seven men are being kept secret for their own protection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security was tight on Monday after a man set himself on fire last week outside the courthouse in an unrelated but gruesome incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to pay US$130,000 in "hush money" to Daniels to ensure an account of their alleged tryst did not get out ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged crime is less significant than the indictments stemming from Trump's attack on the 2020 election – which the Republican lost to Democrat Biden – and his hoarding of secret documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump could face jail time in the current case, although a fine or probation is more likely, analysts say. (AFP)

    New round of US, UK sanctions on Iran

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US and Britain on Thursday imposed a new round of sanctions on Iran as concern grows that Tehran’s unprecedented attack on Israel could fuel a wider war in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control targeted 16 people and two entities in Iran that produce engines which power the drones used in the April 13 attack on Israel. Additionally, Britain is targeting several Iranian military organisations, individuals and entities involved in Iran’s drone and ballistic missile industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will continue to deploy our sanctions authority to counter Iran with further actions in the days and weeks ahead," US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action comes after US officials earlier this week warned that they were readying new sanctions in response to Iran’s activity in the region and to prevent future attacks. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill also have been quickly pushing forward legislation that would financially punish the Islamic Republic and its leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tehran says it launched the April 13 attack in retaliation for Israel's suspected April 1 strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. Israel has said it will retaliate, while a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander on Thursday said Iran could review its "nuclear doctrine" following Israeli threats. (AP/Reuters)

    Albanese slams 'arrogant' Musk as X faces court blow

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian court has ordered X to hide some posts commenting on the stabbing of a bishop in Sydney, deepening a war of words between the social media platform's owner Elon Musk and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia's federal court late on Monday granted the country's cyber regulator, the eSafety commissioner, a two-day injunction requiring the social media platform to hide some posts on a knife attack last week against an Assyrian church bishop, Mar Mari Emmanuel, during a service at his church.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese on Tuesday hit out at Musk, calling him an "arrogant billionaire" for pushing back against the Australian government's calls to take down the content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  X had blocked the content for its users in Australia but said it would not block the posts for users outside the country, arguing that the government had no authority to dictate content its users can see globally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos of the attack posted online showed the attacker, restrained by the congregation, shouting at the bishop for insulting Islam. Police have charged a 16-year-old with a terrorism offence over the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The regulator had asked X to remove certain posts that publicly commented on the attack, which could include videos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Geoffrey Kennett, in an after-hours hearing, ordered X to block access to the posts until Wednesday afternoon, court documents showed. The matter will be considered again on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said social media must have social responsibility but Musk was fighting to keep violent content on his platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll do what's necessary to take on this arrogant billionaire who thinks he's above the law, but also above common decency," Albanese told national broadcaster ABC on Tuesday. "What the eSafety Commissioner is doing, is doing her job to protect the interests of Australians."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk had earlier called the eSafety commissioner the "Australian censorship commissar", drawing rebuke from Albanese who described X's fight against removing violent content as "extraordinary".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to take a moment to thank the PM for informing the public that this platform is the only truthful one," Musk said in a post on X hours before Albanese's comments on Tuesday. (Reuters)

    Ambassador: Sino-US relations need more work

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Xie Feng said the Chinese and US sides had continued to work together in a number of areas. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749928_1_L_20240422092116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to the United States said on Saturday that the two countries need to keep working to improve relations amid "unprecedented challenges".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xie Feng made the comments at Harvard University ahead of a visit to Beijing this week by the top US diplomat, Antony Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether the younger generation can continue to enjoy the eight-decade-long peace and development as their parents did depends largely on whether China and the United States can find the right way to get along in the new era,” Xie said in comments released by the embassy on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xie said talks in California between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November had injected stability into the bilateral relationship and also formed a forward-looking “San Francisco vision”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since the meeting, the two sides have maintained interactions at various levels, and conducted dialogue and cooperation in areas including foreign policy, economy and trade, law enforcement, agriculture, and [military to military] relations,” Xie was quoted by the embassy as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ambassador acknowledged that there was competition between the two sides and said China would not shy away from such competition as long as it was fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He rejected as unfair US claims that China’s lead in areas such as electric vehicles and solar panels was a result of overcapacity, and criticised the US insistence that other countries ban exports of certain products to China.

    India's Modi accused of targeting Muslims in speech

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India's main opposition Congress party filed a complaint to the Election Commission on Monday accusing Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "blatantly targeting" minority Muslims in a campaign speech.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's most populous country is constitutionally secular and its election code bans canvassing based on "communal feelings."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's muscular Hindu-first politics is a key part of his electoral appeal and his opponents accuse him of marginalising India's 200 million Muslim population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister usually steers away from explicit references to religion – the word "Hindu" does not appear in his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) 76-page election manifesto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But at a weekend election rally in Rajasthan, Modi claimed a previous Congress government had said that "Muslims have the first right over the nation's wealth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said if Congress won "it will be distributed among those who have more children. It will be distributed to the infiltrators."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Do you think your hard-earned money should be given to infiltrators? Would you accept this?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics said the phrases were references to Muslims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its complaint to the Election Commission, the Congress party said the "divisive, objectionable and malicious" comments were targeted at "a particular religious community" and amounted to "blatant and direct violations of electoral laws."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were "far worse than any ever made by a sitting Prime Minister in the history of India," the complaint said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congress party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters outside the Commission's office: "We hope concrete action will be taken."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi and the BJP are widely expected to coast to victory in India's marathon elections, which began last Friday and with the results due on June 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this year, Modi presided over the inauguration of a grand temple to the deity Ram, built on the site of a centuries-old mosque razed by Hindu zealots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BJP has frequently invoked the temple on the campaign trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia told reporters on Monday that Modi was calling "a spade a spade" and his remarks resonated with what people thought. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legendary Japanese animators Studio Ghibli will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May, organisers announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Oscar-winning studio, co-founded by Hayao Miyazaki 40 years ago, is beloved worldwide for its masterpieces like "Spirited Away", "My Neighbour Totoro" and "Howl's Moving Castle".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will mark the first that that Cannes gives an award to a collective, rather than an individual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miyazaki makes few public appearances and his long-time collaborator Isao Takahata died in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other founder, producer Toshio Suzuki, said he was "truly honoured and delighted" to be receiving the award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ghibli's "characters populate our imaginations with prolific, colourful universes and sensitive, engaging narrations," said the Cannes organisers in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With Ghibli, Japanese animation stands as one of the great adventures of cinephilia, between tradition and modernity," they added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miyazaki, 83, has announced his retirement more than once, but was back in cinemas last year with "The Boy and the Heron", which won the Oscar for best animated film last month, his second after "Spirited Away" in 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was already announced that another huge figure in cinematic storytelling, George Lucas, creator of "Star Wars", would also receive an honorary Palme at this year's festival, which runs from May 14 to 25. (AFP)

    One dead, seven missing after Japan helicopters crash

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A SH-60K patrol helicopter of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749821_1_L_20240421103203.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person died and seven were missing on Sunday after an apparent accident overnight involving two Japanese military helicopters out to sea, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for Japan's Self-Defense Force (SDF) confirmed the late Saturday incident and said that one person was rescued but later confirmed dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Minoru Kihara said rescuers "spotted what are believed to be part of the aircraft in the sea, and we believe that the two helicopters crashed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this point the cause is unknown, but firstly we do our best to save lives," Kihara told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the helicopters were "doing drills to counter submarines at night".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours later, Kihara told reporters that the crew member who was rescued "was confirmed dead," according to the spokesman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the ministry retrieved flight recorders and was "analysing (the cause of the incident) including possibility of a collision between the two."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The helicopters appear to have crashed during night-time training off the Izu Islands in the Pacific Ocean, broadcaster NHK reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Communication with one chopper was lost at 10.38pm (1338 GMT) off the island of Torishima, and one minute later an emergency signal was received from this aircraft, NHK reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 25 minutes later, at around 11.04pm, the military realised that communication with the other aircraft was also lost in the same area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Mitsubishi SH-60K helicopters from the Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) are mainly based on and operate from naval destroyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MSDF said as there were no other aircraft nor vessels in nearby waters, involvement of another country in the incident is unlikely, NHK added. (AFP)

    Middle East, world cannot 'afford more war': UN chief

    <![CDATA[<img alt="United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres addresses the Security Council. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748876_1_L_20240415052529.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned the international community on Sunday against deeper descent into conflict, addressing the Security Council during a meeting over Iran's weekend attack on Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Neither the region nor the world can afford more war," Guterres said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Middle East is on the brink," he told the Security Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate," he added, calling for "maximum restraint."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, Iran launched a direct attack on its long-time arch foe Israel for the first time, firing a wave of more than 300 missiles and drones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly all of them were intercepted by Israel and others, including the United States, Jordan and Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Israeli army, 12 people were injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran said its attack came in response to a deadly April 1 air strike on Tehran's consulate building in the Syrian capital Damascus that was widely blamed on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That attack killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards, including two senior generals, and prompted Iranian threats of retaliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unprecedented exchange, marking a major escalation between the two countries, has sparked renewed fears of a broader conflict, including the potential for an Israel counterstrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States said on Sunday it will not join any Israeli counterattack on Iran, with President Joe Biden warning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to "think carefully" about any escalation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rising tensions come against the backdrop of Israel's six-month-old war against Hamas in Gaza, which began after the Palestinian militant group's unprecedented attack in Israel October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 33,729 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the conflict, Iran-backed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen have carried out a flurry of attacks on Israeli and Western targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunday's Security Council meeting to address the simmering crisis came at Israel's request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his speech, Guterres repeated his condemnation of Iran's strikes on Israel, and the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's time to step back from the brink. It is vital to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East," Guterres said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also repeated his call for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" in Gaza, which experts warn is on the verge of famine. (AFP)

    Indonesia issues highest alert as volcano erupts

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A volcano erupted several times in Indonesia's outermost region Wednesday, with authorities raising the alert level to its highest point after the dome spewed a column of smoke more than a mile into the sky and forced hundreds to evacuate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mount Ruang, a stratovolcano in North Sulawesi Province, first erupted at 9.45 pm on Tuesday and four times throughout Wednesday, the country's volcanology agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alert level for the volcano, which has a peak of 725 metres above sea level, was then raised on Wednesday evening from three to four, the highest possible level in the four-tiered system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on the result of visual and instrumental observation that showed an increase in volcanic activity, Mount Ruang's level was raised from Level 3 to Level 4," Hendra Gunawan, head of Indonesia's volcanology agency said in a statement late on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities also widened a four-kilometre exclusion zone to six kilometres on Wednesday evening around the crater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no reports of deaths or injuries, but more than 800 people were evacuated from two Ruang Island villages to nearby Tagulandang Island, which is located more than 100 kilometres north of provincial capital Manado, state agency Antara reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The volcanology agency said residents of Tagulandang must be evacuated outside the six-kilometre radius by Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gunawan also warned local residents to "be on alert for the potential ejection of rocks, hot cloud discharges and tsunami caused by the collapse of the volcano's body into the sea," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruang's initial eruption late Tuesday pushed an ash column two kilometres into the sky, with the second eruption pushing it to 2.5 kilometres, Muhammad Wafid, head of the geological agency said in a statement earlier Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The volcanology agency said Tuesday that volcanic activity had increased at Ruang after two earthquakes in recent weeks. (AFP)

    Taylor Swift, 'tortured poet', new album breaks record

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Spotify said Taylor Swift became the most-streamed artist in a single day following her new album debut. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749722_1_L_20240420085534.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taylor Swift's hotly anticipated "The Tortured Poets Department" is here along with a surprise second album - 31 tracks released on Friday in which the megastar purges her inner turmoil while scorching former lovers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first album was released as scheduled at midnight (0400 GMT) but two hours later, an additional 15 tracks appeared - giving legions of Swifties plenty to chew on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Friday evening, platform Spotify declared the album its most-streamed in a single day, with Swift also becoming the most-streamed artist in a single day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here's the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn't mine anymore... it's all yours," she posted on social media in revealing the extra music.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's album comes on the heels of a remarkably successful and busy year for the artist, whose "Midnights" won her a record-setting fourth Album of the Year Grammy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She put on the first tour to break the $1 billion mark and is on track to make a second billion by the time it's over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift also released two re-recordings of her earlier albums to resounding success, and broke box office records with an Eras Tour film.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she also ended a six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn, after which she was linked to - and dramatically de-linked from - front man Matty Healy of the 1975.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now she's dating NFL star Travis Kelce, whose Kansas City Chiefs just won the Super Bowl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And all of the drama is immortalized in song.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When she announced "TTPD," Swift said it would be "an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This period of the author's life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up." (AFP)

    Nasa's Voyager 1 phones home after months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scientists at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory fixed a single malfunctioning chip that was causing Voyager 1 to spout gibberish. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750051_1_L_20240423043314.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa's Voyager 1 probe – the most distant man-made object in the universe – is returning usable information to ground control following months of spouting gibberish, the US space agency announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The spaceship stopped sending readable data back to Earth on November 14, 2023, even though controllers could tell it was still receiving their commands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, teams working at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory discovered that a single malfunctioning chip was to blame, and devised a clever coding fix that worked within the tight memory constraints of its 46-year-old computer system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Voyager 1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems," the agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data again."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 was mankind's first spacecraft to enter the interstellar medium, in 2012, and is currently more than 15 billion miles from Earth. Messages sent from Earth take about 22.5 hours to reach the spacecraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its twin, Voyager 2, also left the solar system in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Voyager spacecraft carry "Golden Records" – 12-inch, gold-plated copper discs intended to convey the story of our world to extraterrestrials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include a map of our solar system, a piece of uranium that serves as a radioactive clock allowing recipients to date the spaceship's launch, and symbolic instructions that convey how to play the record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The contents of the record, selected for Nasa by a committee chaired by legendary astronomer Carl Sagan, include encoded images of life on Earth, as well as music and sounds that can be played using an included stylus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their power banks are expected to be depleted sometime after 2025. They will then continue to wander the Milky Way, potentially for eternity, in silence. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence said on Sunday health workers had uncovered at least 50 bodies of people killed and buried by Israeli forces at a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it was checking the reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the civil defence agency said the remains were discovered in the courtyard of the Nasser Medical Complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Inside the Nasser Medical complex there are mass graves dug by the Israeli occupation ... we were shocked by the presence of bodies of 50 martyrs in one of the pits yesterday," Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the civil defence agency, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are continuing the search operation today and are waiting for all graves to be exhumed in order to give a final number of martyrs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He alleged some of those killed had been tortured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were no clothes on some bodies, which certainly indicates (the victims) faced torture and abuse," Bassal said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Intense fighting raged in mid-February in the area of the hospital, and Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles surrounded it on March 26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate statement on Sunday, Hamas condemned what it said was a "mass grave of those executed in cold blood and buried with military bulldozers in the hospital's courtyard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said more than 50 bodies had been recovered there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several of the bodies wrapped in white shrouds were later collected by relatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals in Gaza have not been spared in the Israeli assault, with the military accusing Hamas of using the facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted in the October 7 attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organisation said on April 6 that the Palestinian territory's largest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, had been reduced to ashes by an Israeli siege last month, leaving an "empty shell" containing many bodies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHO staff who gained access to the devastated facility described horrifying scenes of bodies only partly buried, their limbs sticking out, and the stench of decomposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel is engaged in a sweeping military assault against Hamas militants in Gaza after they launched a attack on southern Israeli communities on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unprecedented assault resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, Israelis and foreigners, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 250 people were abducted to Gaza during the attack, of whom 129 remain captive, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has so far killed 34,097 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three Russian missiles slammed into the city centre of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, wounding dozens more and damaging civilian buildings, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Kyiv's allies to rush in air defence support after the city, which had a pre-war population of 300,000, became the latest target of an intensifying Russian air strike campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This would not have happened if Ukraine had received sufficient air defence equipment and if the world's determination to counter Russian terror had been sufficient," Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos showed flames and columns of black smoke rising over Chernihiv, which is about 150 km from the capital Kyiv and about 80 km from the Russian border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three explosions ripped through a busy central area of the city just after 9am local time, destroying a hotel, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strike also damaged several multi-storey residential buildings, a hospital, an education facility and dozens of private cars, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, Russia continues to engage in terrorist activity against civilians and civilian infrastructure as confirmed by this strike on Chernihiv once again," acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako said on national television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixty people, including three children, were wounded, the emergency services said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia, which denies targeting civilians, attacked with three Iskander cruise missiles, governor Vyacheslav Chaus told the Suspilne public broadcaster. (Reuters)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749042_1_L_20240416013820.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A knife attack at a live-streamed church service in Australia wounded four people on Monday and sparked clashes between riot police and outraged members of the local community.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A bishop and the 15-year-old suspect were among those being treated for "non-life threatening injuries" after the attack at an Assyrian Christian church in the west of Sydney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the suspect is being held at an undisclosed location after his alleged attack provoked communal violence that also left two officers hospitalised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident came two days after a man with a knife killed six people at a shopping mall in the city's east before being shot dead by police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Graphic footage of Monday's stabbing showed the suspect emerging from the congregation, rushing the dais and slashing wildly at Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel before being subdued by churchgoers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social media accounts leapt on news of the attack to make claims about the motive, none of which were verified by police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were tense scenes outside the church after Monday's attack, with hundreds of angry members of the local community trying to make their way past a phalanx of riot police to reach the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A journalist at the scene saw projectiles being hurled before police with riot shields and body armour pushed the protesters away from the church.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New South Wales acting assistant police commissioner Andrew Holland said the crowd had displayed an "emotional response to what took place in the church" – fuelled by rumours and graphic images circulating on the internet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two police vehicles and a number of houses were damaged as the protesters threw "bottles, bricks and other items," Holland said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One officer was "hit with a metal object and sustained a twisted knee and a chipped tooth," police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another constable sustained a broken jaw after he was hit with a brick and a fence paling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police urged the public to avoid the area amid "a large police response."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video of Monday's attack was taken at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church, which has an online following of almost 200,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is located in Sydney's western suburb of Wakeley, a hub for Sydney's small Christian Assyrian community, many of whom fled persecution and war in Iraq and Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New South Wales state premier Chris Minns issued a joint statement with Christian and Muslim leaders calling for calm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're calling on everyone to act with kindness and respect for each other," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the time to show that we are strong and united."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assyrians trace their roots to an empire that ruled a swathe of the ancient Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since that age of empire, they have faced persecution as a religious and ethnic minority distinct from the region's Arab and Muslim majorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australians are still reeling from Saturday's stabbing, which was carried out by a 40-year-old man with a history of mental illness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In that attack, videos shared on social media showed unshaven itinerant Joel Cauchi pursuing mostly female victims as he rampaged through the vast, crowded Westfield shopping complex in Bondi Junction on Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A black ribbon was projected onto the Sydney Opera House on Monday as a mark of respect for the victims of that attack. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military on Monday said North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile into the sea off South Korea's east coast, the latest in an apparent volley of tests by Pyongyang this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "North Korea has fired an unidentified missile into the East Sea," South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tokyo also confirmed the launch, with the Japanese defence ministry saying "a suspected ballistic missile was launched from North Korea" in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japanese media reported the suspected missile fell outside Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul-based specialist site NK News said the "brief flight time, likely under 10 minutes, pointed to the launch involving a short-range ballistic missile or a multiple launch rocket system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest launch comes after UN sanctions monitoring against the nuclear-armed nation was upended last month by Russia. (AFP)

    Jury selection starts at Trump's criminal trial in NY

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former US President Donald Trump looks on at Manhattan criminal court in New York. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749047_1_L_20240416064119.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's New York criminal trial opened on Monday in a historic first for a US ex-president – and a seismic twist to an already explosive 2024 election where the Republican is seeking to defy multiple scandals and return to power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump has repeatedly described the hush money case as a sham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But reality set in for the 77-year-old, hard-right Republican as Judge Juan Merchan issued the routine warning for criminal defendants that he will have to attend proceedings in the gritty Manhattan courthouse daily – or face arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan also warned Trump against repeating his frequent past attempts to disrupt hearings with incendiary social media posts and courtroom outbursts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge scheduled a hearing next week to consider whether Trump should already be held in contempt for violating a partial gag order restricting him from attacking individuals connected to the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Selection of 12 jurors – given anonymity to protect them from what the judge says is risk of bribery or even physical harm – is expected to be a tortuous process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the first batch of 96 prospective panelists sworn in, at least 50 were quickly excused after they said they could not be fair and impartial in a case involving one of the most famous – and controversial – men in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine others were allowed to leave after stating there were compelling reasons they could not serve, while remaining prospective jurors were grilled about their education, hobbies and news consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The process, which will resume Tuesday at 1330 GMT, could go on as long as two weeks, according to one of Trump's lawyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan also indicated opposition to allowing Trump to be out of court next Thursday, when the US Supreme Court will hear his claims of presidential immunity in another, unrelated case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt," Trump said leaving court on Monday. "We've got a real problem with this judge."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican presidential candidate is accused of falsifying business records in a scheme to cover up an alleged extramarital sexual encounter with adult film actress Stormy Daniels to shield his first election campaign, in 2016, from last-minute upheaval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He faces three other criminal cases centered on his hoarding of top-secret documents after leaving office and his unprecedented attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden. (AFP)

    Google sacks 28 after sit-in protest

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Google fired 28 employees following a disruptive sit-down protest over the tech giant's contract with the Israeli government, a Google spokesperson said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Tuesday demonstration was organized by the group "No Tech for Apartheid," which has long opposed "Project Nimbus," Google's joint US$1.2 billion contract with Amazon to provide cloud services to the government of Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video of the demonstration showed police arresting Google workers in Sunnyvale, California, in the office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian's, according to a post by the advocacy group on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kurian's office was occupied for 10 hours, the advocacy group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers held signs including "Googlers against Genocide," a reference to accusations surrounding Israel's attacks on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No Tech for Apartheid," which also held protests in New York and Seattle, pointed to an April 12 Time magazine article reporting a draft contract of Google billing the Israeli Ministry of Defense more than US$1 million for consulting services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "small number" of employees "disrupted" a few Google locations, but the protests are "part of a long-standing campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don't work at Google," a Google spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After refusing multiple requests to leave the premises, law enforcement was engaged to remove them to ensure office safety," the Google spokesperson said. "We have so far concluded individual investigations that resulted in the termination of employment for 28 employees, and will continue to investigate and take action as needed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel is one of "numerous" governments for which Google provides cloud computing services, the Google spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services," the Google spokesperson said. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pedro Sanchez has put public duties on hold. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750424_1_L_20240425032512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he will suspend public duties until next week to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife's private dealings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, who last year secured another term for his Socialist party as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would appear before the media on Monday, April 29 to announce his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I need to pause and think," he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. "I urgently need an answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile (...) whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock announcement came after a Spanish court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into whether Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez committed a crime of influence peddling and corruption in business in her private dealings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court investigating Gomez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and preliminary, only saying it followed a complaint raised by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias – Clean Hands – whose leader has links to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manos Limpias said Gomez used her influence as the wife of the prime minister to allegedly secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo of the People's Party and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had "collaborated" with those circulating the claims against his wife.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ministers came out in support, with Energy Minister Teresa Ribera saying: "We have a first rate prime minister. Neither he nor his family deserve this." (Reuters)

    Israeli strike kills 9 members of family in Rafah

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday an overnight Israeli strike killed nine members of a Palestinian family including six children in the southern city of Rafah.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Five children aged one to seven and a 16-year-old girl were among the dead, along with two women and a man, according to the city's Al Najjar hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nine martyrs including six children were pulled out from the rubble after Israeli air forces struck a house of the Radwan family in Tal al-Sultan in Rafah," Gaza Civil Defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outside the hospital witnesses saw people grieving over small body bags. A woman stroked a dead boy's forehead as planes rumbled overhead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People were sleeping peacefully," said neighbour Abu Mohammed Ziyadah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As you can see, there were no militants, not even male adults, except for the head of the family. They were all women and children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon after the war in Gaza began on October 7, Israel told Palestinians living in the north of Gaza to move to "safe zones" in the territory's south such as Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has since vowed to invade the city, where around 1.5 million people – more than half the territory's population – are sheltering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has for two months threatened to send troops in against Hamas militants, but even without such an operation Rafah is under regular bombardment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bassal said the Israeli army struck several areas in Rafah overnight, including the Salam neighbourhood where one person was killed and several wounded. He said the army hit a house and a nursery school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a very hard night on Rafah," he said. (AFP)

 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said Israel will increase "military pressure" on Palestinian militant group Hamas in a bid to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In the coming days we will increase the military and political pressure on Hamas because this is the only way to free our hostages," Netanyahu said in a video statement on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover, threatening to "deliver additional and painful blows" without specifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an international outcry, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the army will launch a ground assault on Rafah, a southern Gaza city so far spared an Israeli invasion where more than 1.5 million Palestinians have taken refuge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army has said some of the hostages abducted from southern Israel during Hamas's October 7 attack that sparked the war were being held in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised statement later on Sunday that "the chief of staff has approved the next steps for the war," without offering details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On Passover, it will be 200 days of captivity for the hostages... We will fight until you return home to us." (AFP)

    UN calls for probe into deaths at Gaza hospitals

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health workers arrange bodies found at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750249_1_L_20240424023831.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations called on Tuesday for an international investigation into reports of mass graves at two Gaza hospitals destroyed in Israeli sieges, saying war crimes might have been committed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office said it was "horrified" by the destruction of Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa in Gaza City, and its second largest, the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's Civil Defence agency said on Tuesday that health workers had uncovered nearly 340 bodies, updating an earlier figure, of Palestinians allegedly killed and buried by Israeli forces at the Nasser complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army dismissed claims that its troops had buried bodies during its operation at Nasser as "baseless and unfounded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office demanded "independent, effective and transparent investigations into the deaths."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators," UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals, which are protected under international law, have repeatedly come under Israeli bombardment over more than six months of war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has accused Palestinian militant group Hamas of using medical facilities as command centres and to hold hostages abducted during its attack inside Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has denied the claims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law," Turk said. "And the intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de combat is a war crime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN rights office said it did not have access to independent information as to what happened at the two hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said efforts were under way to corroborate reports and details given by Gazan authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Victims had reportedly been buried deep in the ground and covered with waste," she told reporters in Geneva, adding that older people, women and wounded were reportedly among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were allegedly "found with their hands tied and stripped of their clothes." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Speaker of the US House of Representatives Mike Johnson says he would " american="" boys."="" bullets="" photo:="" rather="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" reuters"="" send="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749798_1_L_20240421024235.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto" than="" to="" ukraine=""/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers in the US House of Representatives on Saturday quickly passed legislation to provide more aid to Ukraine and Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bills, passed in a rare Saturday session, were approved by overwhelming bipartisan votes, though they leave the future of House speaker Mike Johnson in doubt as he seeks to fend off angry far-right detractors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the long-delayed aid package, saying the military and economic assistance would "save thousands and thousands of lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bills are the product of months of acrimonious negotiations, pressure from US allies and repeated pleas for assistance from Zelensky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spending bills cost the last Republican speaker of the House his job, and funding for Ukraine has been at the heart of the partisan squabbling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has been the chief military backer of Ukraine in its war against Russia, but Congress has not approved large-scale funding for its ally for nearly a year and a half, mainly because of the cross-aisle bickering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers in Congress have been pushing for a major new weapons package for Ukraine for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Republicans, influenced by the party's presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been reluctant to provide funding to Kyiv for the drawn-out conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financing of the war has become a point of contention ahead of a presidential election in November that is expected to pit Biden against Trump once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson, after months of hesitation, finally threw his support behind the US$61 billion package for Ukraine that includes economic assistance and weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To put it bluntly, I'd rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys," Johnson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on social media after the bill was passed, Ukraine's Zelensky expressed hope that the bill would soon clear the US Senate and be signed into law by Biden. "Thank you, America!" he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill also allows Biden to confiscate and sell Russian assets and provide the money to Ukraine to finance reconstruction, a move that has been embraced by other G7 nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The upper chamber could take the bill up as early as Tuesday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749791_1_L_20240421004150.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of demonstrators hit the streets across Spain's Canary Islands on Saturday to demand changes to the model of mass tourism they say is overwhelming the Atlantic archipelago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rallying under the slogan "The Canary Islands have a limit", demonstrators began rallying at midday (1100 GMT), flag-waving crowds packing the streets of the main towns across all of the archipelago's seven islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chanting and whistling, they waved scores of placards and banners emblazoned with slogans reading: "The Canary Islands are not up for sale!" or "A moratorium on tourism" while others simply said: "Respect my home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers say mass tourism perpetuates an economic model that harms local residents and are demanding the authorities limit the numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said 20,000 demonstrators had turned out for the demonstrations, but organisers put the figure closer to 50,000, Spain's public television said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not against tourism," one woman demonstrator called Rosario Correo told Spain's TVE public television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're asking that they change this model that allows for unlimited growth of tourism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are calling for a halt to the work on two new hotels on Tenerife, the largest and most developed of the archipelago's seven islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And they also want residents to be given a greater say in what they see as uncontrolled development which is harming the environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government and the islands' regional leaders must stop this corrupt model of never-ending growth which is based on the destruction of the environment and which only weakens the economy," said another demonstrator called Alfonso Boullon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters also gathered in Madrid and Barcelona to show their support for the rallies in the Canary Islands, public television said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-tourism protests have multiplied in recent months across Spain, the world's second-most visited country, prompting authorities to try to reconcile the interests of locals and a lucrative sector that accounts for 12.8 percent of Spain's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The islands, which lie off the northwestern coast of Africa, are known for their volcanic landscapes and year-round sunshine attracting millions of visitors every year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some four out of 10 residents work in tourism which accounts for 36 percent of the islands' GDP, official figures show. (AFP)

    Rare storms force Dubai airport to turn away flights

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dubai's major international airport began diverting all incoming flights on Tuesday as heavy rains lashed the city, causing widespread flooding.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's busiest air hub for international passengers, which had been expecting more than 100 flights on Tuesday evening, earlier briefly halted its operations in the chaos caused by the storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dubai, the Middle East's financial centre, has been paralysed by the torrential rain that caused floods around the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and left 18 dead in Oman on Sunday and Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to the continued exceptional weather event currently being experienced in the UAE, Dubai International is temporarily diverting inbound flights due to arrive this evening... until the inclement situation improves," a Dubai Airports spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Departures will continue, said the spokesperson, who earlier warned that roads around the airport have suffered major flooding and urged passengers to use public transport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Airport operations were earlier suspended for 25 minutes before resuming. Unconfirmed images on social media showed planes taxiing across an apron flooded with standing water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similar scenes were repeated across Dubai and elsewhere in the UAE as the desert country, better known for its arid climate and intense summer heat, reeled from the storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flagship shopping centres Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates both suffered flooding and water was ankle-deep in at least one Dubai Metro station, according to images posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roads and residential communities also suffered heavy flooding and many residents reported leaks from roofs, doors and windows. (AFP)

    Trump trial 'not about his presidency', jurors told

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star is not a referendum on his presidency, a prosecutor told prospective jurors on Tuesday in asking whether they could put personal politics aside.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This case is really not about whether you like Donald Trump. This case is about the rule of law and whether Donald Trump broke it," Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told the 18 prospective jurors who remained of an initial pool of 96.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jury selection for the former US president's trial got under way on Monday. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Daniels says she had a sexual encounter with Trump about a decade beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies an encounter took place. The Republican presidential candidate has called the case, brought by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a partisan witch hunt meant to interfere with his campaign to unseat President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hush money case is one of four criminal indictments he faces, which stem from alleged mishandling classified information and trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases, which may not go to trial before the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proceedings so far have underscored the challenges of choosing a jury of 12 residents of heavily Democratic Manhattan who can try the case fairly and impartially.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roughly half of 96 potential jurors summoned on Monday were dismissed after saying they could not impartially judge the polarising businessman-turned-politician.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six more were excused on Tuesday. They said they had scheduling conflicts, concerns about balancing juror service with their jobs, or had thought further overnight and come to the conclusion they could not be fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jurors allowed to stay on for now after answering questions on Tuesday included an asset manager at Lazard who is originally from Mexico and enjoys scuba diving and skiing, and a corporate lawyer from Oregon who hikes and runs in his spare time and reads the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, wearing a blue tie, at times held a piece of paper up to his face as jurors read out answers to a list of 42 questions. Occasionally he yawned and leaned back in his chair at the defence table. (Reuters)

    Boeing safety in spotlight before US Senate

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sam Salehpour prepares to give evidence at a US Senate hearing. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749355_1_L_20240418033913.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's safety culture and manufacturing quality, both at the centre of a full-blown crisis following a January mid-air panel blowout, faced scrutiny on Wednesday in two US Senate hearings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Boeing has been grappling with a safety crisis after the door plug panel blew off an Alaska Airlines flight that took off from Portland, Oregon, on January 5. The planemaker has undergone a management shakeup, US regulators have put curbs on its production, and deliveries fell by half in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Testimony at the US Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations raised questions about missing records surrounding the panel, along with production concerns over two separate Boeing widebody jets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former Boeing engineer Ed Pierson said he turned over records, sent to him from an internal whistleblower, to the FBI that he said provided information about the plug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing has said it believed that required documents detailing the removal of the door plug were never created. Boeing directed questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which was not immediately available for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FBI declined to comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whistleblower Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer who raised questions about two of the planemaker's widebody jets, claimed he was told to "shut up" when he flagged safety concerns. He has said that he was removed from the 787 programme and transferred to the 777 jet due to his questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salehpour has claimed Boeing failed to adequately shim, or use a thin piece of material to fill tiny gaps in a manufactured product, an omission that could cause premature fatigue failure over time in some areas of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salehpour said he had reached out to Boeing official Lisa Fahl but was not provided specific safety data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fahl has said the 787, which was launched in 2004, had a specification of five-thousandths of an inch gap allowance within a five-inch area, or "the thickness of a human hair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you are operating at 35,000 feet," the size of a human hair can be a matter of life and death, Salehpour told the hearing. (Reuters)

    Ukraine says situation 'tense' on eastern front

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday pleaded for the release of US war aid for Ukraine that has long been blocked by Congress. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748874_1_L_20240415042055.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Sunday said the situation was "tense" on its eastern front, where the Russian army is doubling down on efforts to seize the strategic town of Chassiv Iar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said he had visited troops on the frontier, where Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and running low on ammunition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said "the situation is tense," a day after Kyiv warned that the situation on its eastern front was significantly worsening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Moscow manages to capture Chassiv Iar, it would "create conditions for a deeper advance" towards the key Ukrainian transport hub of Kramatorsk, said Ukraine's commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kramatorsk town is the major rail and logistics hub for the Ukrainian army, 30 kilometres from Chassiv Iar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has been trying to break through to the west of Bakhmut – a town conquered by the Russians in May 2023 after a bloody battle – according to Umerov.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent weeks, Moscow has claimed the capture of several small villages, notably near the industrial town of Avdiivka on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also ramped up its aerial bombardments on Ukraine's infrastructure in recent weeks, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying the Kremlin was aiming to drive people from its second city Kharkiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rhetoric does not protect the sky," Zelenskyy said on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy said that only "tangible assistance" can stop missiles and drones, adding a plea for the release of US war aid for Ukraine that has long been blocked by Congress. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The H5N1 bird flu virus strain has been detected in very high concentrations in raw milk from infected animals, the WHO said on Friday, though how long the virus can survive in milk is unknown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Avian influenza A(H5N1) first emerged in 1996 but since 2020, the number of outbreaks in birds has grown exponentially, alongside an increase in the number of infected mammals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The strain has led to the deaths of tens of millions of poultry, with wild birds and land and marine mammals also infected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cows and goats joined the list last month -- a surprising development for experts because they were not thought to be susceptible to this type of influenza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US authorities earlier this month said a person working on a dairy farm in Texas was recovering from bird flu after being exposed to cattle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The case in Texas is the first case of a human infected by avian influenza by a cow," said Wenqing Zhang, head of the global influenza programme at the World Health Organization.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Bird-to-cow, cow-to-cow and cow-to-bird transmission have also been registered during these current outbreaks, which suggest that the virus may have found other routes of transition than we previously understood," she told a media briefing in Geneva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was only the second case of a human testing positive for bird flu in the United States, and came after the virus sickened herds that were apparently exposed to wild birds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now we see multiple herds of cows affected in an increasing number of US states, which shows a further step of the virus spillover to mammals," Zhang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The virus has also been detected in milk from infected animals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang said there was a "very high virus concentration in raw milk", but experts were still investigating exactly how long the virus is able to survive in milk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Texas health department has said the cattle infections do not present a concern for the commercial milk supply, as dairies are required to destroy milk from sick cows. Pasteurisation also kills the virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is important for people to ensure safe food practices, including consuming only pasteurised milk and milk products," said Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From 2003 to April 1 this year, the WHO said it had recorded 463 deaths from 889 human cases across 23 countries, putting the case fatality rate at 52 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang noted that the human cases recorded in Europe and the United States in the past few years -- since the virus surged -- have been mild cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So far, there is no evidence that A(H5N1) is spreading between humans. (AFP)

    EU reaches out to Britain over youth mobility

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Britain's exit from the EU meant that the bloc's citizens could no longer move easily to the United Kingdom for study or work. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749529_1_L_20240419010936.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU said on Thursday it wants to make it easy once again for its young people to live, study and work in Britain, and vice versa -- a freedom hit hard by Brexit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  When Britain formally left the European Union in 2020, one of the changes most felt by the bloc's citizens was that they could no longer move as they wished to the United Kingdom for study or work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, the European Commission says it is time to repair that -- at least for those aged 18 to 30 -- and wants the 27 EU nations to approve talks after London expressed interest in youth mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain left the European student exchange scheme Erasmus after Brexit, but the commission said that should the UK wish to rejoin, it remained "open" to the idea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UK government appeared to pour cold water on the proposal, however, preferring bilateral schemes with individual countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commission's proposal envisages setting university fees in Britain and the bloc at the same level for EU and UK students, as it was before Brexit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the commission, tuition for non-UK residents at British universities now averages 22,000 pounds (HK$214,540) a year, compared to around 9,000 pounds for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU said that by comparison the fees in the bloc's universities were "not that high".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the commission's plans, young EU and UK citizens would be able to stay in the country of their choice for up to four years and visa fees would not be "excessive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently a young person from the EU seeking to study in the UK must pay £490 while a skilled worker visa costs between £719 and £1,639, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also an extra cost for healthcare running into the hundreds of pounds that the commission wants to scrap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unlike visas for work or study, which are often limited to specific institutions or jobs, the idea would be that young people can be free to move between the UK and EU countries and undertake different activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commission executive vice president Maros Sefcovic said Brexit had hit young people who wanted to study, work and live abroad "particularly hard".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, we take the first step towards an ambitious but realistic agreement between the EU and the UK that would fix this issue. Our aim is to rebuild human bridges between young Europeans on both sides of the Channel," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokeswoman for the UK government suggested it favours its current approach of brokering such agreements with individual countries rather than the European Union as a whole. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Germany's Interior Minister, Nancy Faeser, reiterated Germany's steadfast support for Ukraine. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749525_1_L_20240418234643.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two German-Russian men have been arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia and planning attacks in Germany -- including on US army targets -- to undermine military support for Ukraine, prosecutors said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair, identified only as Dieter S. and Alexander J., were arrested in Bayreuth in the southeastern state of Bavaria on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main accused, Dieter S., is alleged to have scouted potential targets for attacks, "including facilities of the US armed forces" stationed in Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have searched both men's homes and places of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are suspected of "having been active for a foreign intelligence service" in what prosecutors described as a "particularly serious case" of espionage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Nancy Faeser likewise called the allegations "a particularly serious case of suspected agent activity for (Vladimir) Putin's criminal regime".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to thwart such threat plans," she said, reiterating Germany's steadfast support for Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock summoned the Russian ambassador over the arrests, the ministry in Berlin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to prosecutors, Dieter S. had been exchanging information with a person linked to Russian intelligence services since October 2023, discussing possible acts of sabotage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The actions were intended, in particular, to undermine the military support provided from Germany to Ukraine against the Russian aggression," prosecutors said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accused allegedly expressed readiness to "commit explosive and arson attacks mainly on military infrastructure and industrial sites in Germany".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dieter S. collected information about potential targets, "including facilities of the US armed forces".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow accused Alexander J. began assisting him from March 2024, they added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dieter S. scouted potential targets by taking photos and videos of military transport and equipment. He then allegedly shared the information with his contact person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Der Spiegel magazine reported that the military facilities spied on included the US army base in Grafenwoehr in Bavaria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Among other things, there is an important military training area there where the US army trains Ukrainian soldiers, for example on Abrams battle tanks," Der Spiegel wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dieter S. faces an additional charge of belonging to a "foreign terrorist organisation". Prosecutors said they suspect he was a fighter in an armed unit of eastern Ukraine's self-proclaimed pro-Russian "People's Republic of Donetsk" in 2014-2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Germany is Ukraine's second-largest supplier of military aid, and news of the spy arrests came as Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck was on a visit to Kyiv. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Malaysian navy helicopters collided in mid-air during a rehearsal on Tuesday for a naval parade, killing all 10 crew members aboard, the country's navy said in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Naval officials said the incident occurred at the Lumut base in the western state of Perak on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All victims were confirmed dead at the scene and sent to the Lumut base military hospital for identification," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A video circulating on local media showed several helicopters flying in formation, when one of the choppers' rotor clipped another before both aircraft crashed into the ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The navy said it would carry out an investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said the aircraft - a maritime operations helicopter and a Fennec military chopper - were rehearsing for a parade celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Royal Malaysian Navy, due to be held on Saturday. (Reuters)

    'Israel retaliates, strikes central Iran'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Military personnel stand guard at a nuclear facility in Isfahan. Iranian media report no damage to nuclear facilities. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749571_2_L_20240419183846.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's state media reported explosions in the central province of Isfahan on Friday, as US media quoted officials saying Israel had carried out retaliatory strikes on its arch-rival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Iranian media said no major damage was reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Reports indicate there was no major damage or large explosions caused by the impact of any air threat," the official IRNA news agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Air defence systems over several Iranian cities had been activated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had previously warned it would hit back after Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend. Most of them were intercepted. It followed an April 1 strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that was widely blamed on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's Fars news agency reported "three explosions" were heard near the Shekari army airbase in the northwest of Isfahan province, while Iran's space agency spokesman Hossein Dalirian said "several" drones had been "successfully shot down".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are no reports of a missile attack for now," Dalirian said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nuclear facilities in Isfahan were reported to be "completely secure", Iran's Tasnim news agency reported, citing "reliable sources".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ABC and CBS News reported the strikes had been carried out by Israel, quoting US officials. There was no immediate comment from the White House or Pentagon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CNN quoted an official as saying the target of the Israeli attack was not nuclear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military told AFP: "We don't have a comment at this time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has vowed to destroy Hamas over its October 7 attack that started the Gaza war, has stressed that Israel "reserves the right to protect itself" against Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, Israel's main ally and military supplier, has made clear it would not join a reprisal attack on Iran, but unveiled sanctions against people and entities involved in producing the drones deployed in the Iranian assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are holding Iran accountable," US President Joe Biden said on Thursday, announcing the measures after the European Union said it would also sanction Iran's drone programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian had warned that Tehran would make Israel "regret" any attack on the Islamic republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flights were suspended across swathes of Iran on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Iran's air defence has been activated in the skies of several provinces of the country," Tehran's official IRNA news agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mehr news agency reported that "flights to Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz, and airports in the west, northwest and southwest have been suspended."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flight-tracking software showed commercial flights avoiding western Iran, including Isfahan, and skirting Tehran to the north and east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres painted a dark picture of the situation in the Middle East, warning that spiralling tensions over the war in Gaza and Iran's attack on Israel could devolve into a "full-scale regional conflict."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Middle East is on a precipice. Recent days have seen a perilous escalation – in words and deeds," Guterres told the Security Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One miscalculation, one miscommunication, one mistake, could lead to the unthinkable – a full-scale regional conflict that would be devastating for all involved," he said, calling on all parties to exercise "maximum restraint." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The armorer who loaded the gun that killed a cinematographer on the set of the Alec Baldwin movie "Rust" was sentenced to 18 months in prison by a US court on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hannah Gutierrez stood impassive as a judge in New Mexico told her she would serve the maximum sentence after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the October 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins during filming of the budget Western.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You were the armorer, the one that stood between a safe weapon and a weapon that could kill someone. You alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon," Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But for you, Miss Hutchins would be alive. A husband would have his partner and a little boy would have his mother."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gutierrez's 10-day trial had heard how despite being the person responsible for on-set firearms, the 26-year-old had repeatedly failed to follow basic safety rules, leaving guns unattended and allowing actors – including Baldwin – to wave weapons around.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also heard how she was responsible for the presence of six live rounds – a movie industry red line – and how she had loaded one of them into the Colt 45 that Baldwin was using.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weapon discharged as the actor was preparing a scene inside a wooden church, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Halyna Hutchins died due to a cascade of safety violations that began with Miss Gutierrez introducing live rounds to the movie set, loading one into a prop gun telling the members of the crew that it was a cold gun," prosecutor Kari Morrissey told the sentencing hearing in Santa Fe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That conduct absent responsibility or remorse is deserving of a sentence of 18 months."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Morrissey told the judge that Gutierrez had made around 200 calls from jail since her conviction, in which she complained that she was being unfairly victimised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rather than accept responsibility, she has chosen to place blame on the witnesses who testified against her, me, you, the jurors, the set Medic and the paramedics who tried to save Miss Hutchins life," Morrissey said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Her jail calls... tell us who Miss Gutierrez really is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gutierrez sobbed as she begged the court for probation, rather than jail time, but insisted that she was not wholly to blame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Your Honour, when I took on 'Rust,' I was young and I was naive. But I took my job as seriously as I knew how to, despite not having proper time, resources and staffing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The jury has found me in part at fault for this god awful tragedy. but that doesn't make me a monster. That makes me human," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Baldwin, who was also a producer on the movie, faces his own involuntary manslaughter trial in July. He denies the charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, he too faces a possible 18 months in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dave Halls, the film's safety coordinator and assistant director, who handed Baldwin the loaded gun, agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors last year and was sentenced to six months' probation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tragedy sent shock waves through Hollywood and led to calls for a complete ban on the use of weapons on movie sets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industry insiders, however, insisted that rules were already in place to prevent such incidents, and that those working on "Rust" had not followed them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The filming of "Rust" was halted by the tragedy, but completed last year on location in Montana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cinematographer's widower, Matthew Hutchins, who has already settled a wrongful death suit with "Rust" producers, served as an executive producer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No release date has been announced. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 58 people going to a funeral died after their overloaded boat capsized in the Central African Republic's capital Bangui, the head of civil protection said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We were able to extract 58 lifeless bodies. We don't know the total number of people who are underwater," Thomas Djimasse told Radio Guira.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to witnesses and videos on social media, the boat was carrying more than 300 people – some standing and others perched on wooden structures – when it overturned on the Mpoko river on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel was heading to the funeral of a village chief but capsized shortly after setting off, with rescuers arriving 40 minutes after the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maurice Kapenya, who followed the boat in a canoe because there was no space on board, said he collected the bodies of some of the victims, including his own sister, with the help of fishermen and residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Families were seen near the river on Saturday looking for their loved ones who were still missing. (AFP)
