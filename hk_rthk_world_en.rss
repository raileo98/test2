<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday said the China-Hungary relationship is now at its best in history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meeting with his Hungarian counterpart Tamas Sulyok at the Sandor Palace in Budapest, Xi said the friendship between the two nations had taken deep roots among the people, and cooperation in various fields had yielded fruitful outcomes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also expressed his readiness to foster a good working relationship and friendship with Sulyok, increase exchanges and communication on matters of mutual interest, and jointly promote the high-level development of bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary and China, which mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations, were also expected to sign at least 16 new cooperation agreements, one of which could be a large-scale infrastructure project linked to the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol announced new measures to raise the country's birthrate, which is one of the lowest globally. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752479_1_20240509172049.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on Thursday said his government's efforts to improve people's lives had fallen short, conceding his ruling party's crushing election defeat last month reflected voters' assessment of his two years in office.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his first press conference in 21 months, Yoon pledged to focus on improving the economy and tackling what he called the national emergency of flagging birth rates over the three years he has left in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3 percent in the first three months of this year, but living costs have remained stubbornly high, despite some progress in tackling inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a new policy push, a government ministry would be set up to tackle the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque reading "The Buck Stops Here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, maintained its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising kids as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Students at Ireland's Trinity College Dublin (TCD) on Wednesday ended a five-day protest against Israel's actions in Gaza after they said their demands were met by the university.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement posted on its website, the university said "an agreement was reached" after "successful talks between the university's senior management and the protesters".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Laszlo Molnarfi, president of the institution's student union, said TCD's statement was a "testament to grassroots student-staff power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TCD said the university "will complete a divestment from investments in Israeli companies that have activities in the occupied Palestinian Territory and appear on the UN blacklist in this regard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters had demanded the university end any relationships it had with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security staff had closed the campus gates -- which are usually open to the public -- during the protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student activists began their action last Friday as a "solidarity encampment with Palestine" echoing similar protests in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pro-Palestinian protests have rocked US campuses for weeks, spreading to countries in Europe as well as Australia. (AFP)

    Biden warns Israel US will stop weapons supply

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden says Washington will halt all weapons to Israel if it launches a full-scale invasion of Rafah. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752409_1_20240509104320.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden on Wednesday publicly warned Israel for the first time that the US would stop supplying it weapons if Israeli forces make a major invasion of Rafah, a refugee-packed city in southern Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah,” Biden said in an interview with CNN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The American leader's comments represent his strongest public language to date in his effort to deter an Israeli assault on Rafah while underscoring a growing rift between the US and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden acknowledged US weapons had been used by Israeli forces to kill civilians in Gaza, where the Jewish state has mounted a seven-month-old offensive aimed at destroying Hamas following its October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's campaign has so far killed at least 30,000 Palestinians, many of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centres," he said when asked about 2,000-pound bombs sent to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, earlier this week called Washington's decision to delay shipments "very disappointing" although he did not believe the US would stop supplying arms to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel this week attacked Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians have sought refuge, but Biden said he did not consider Israel’s strikes a full-scale invasion because they have not struck “population centres.” (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from devastating floods that have ravaged southern Brazil for days reached 100 on Wednesday, authorities said, as the search continued for dozens of people still missing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with hundreds of people injured and 160,000 forced from their homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many have no access to drinking water or electricity – or even the means to call for help with telephone and internet services down in many places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as "the emergency is continuing to develop" in the state capital of Porto Alegre and other cities and towns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were at work across the state, many in boats, and even jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslide and health hazards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people are loathe to leave their homes for the safety of shelters amid reports of abandoned properties being looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Contaminated water can transmit diseases," civil defence spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Confederation of Municipalities said nearly 100,000 homes had been damaged or destroyed by unprecedented rains and floods in the state, with losses estimated at about 4.6 billion reais (more than US$900 million.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Porto Alegre is home to about 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and five dams are at risk of rupturing. (AFP)

    'South Gaza hospitals have only three days' fuel left'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This Palestinian boy faces a long wait for treatment at the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752368_1_20240509003721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip have only three days of fuel left, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday, due to closed border crossings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Despite international objections, Israel sent tanks into the overcrowded southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and seized the nearby crossing into Egypt that is the main conduit for aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The closure of the border crossing continues to prevent the UN from bringing fuel. Without fuel all humanitarian operations will stop. Border closures are also impeding delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hospitals in the south of Gaza only have three days of fuel left, which means services may soon come to a halt."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tedros said Al-Najjar, one of the three hospitals in Rafah, was no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in the vicinity and the military operation in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At a time when fragile humanitarian operations urgently require expansion, the Rafah military operation is further limiting our ability to reach thousands of people who have been living in dire conditions without adequate food, sanitation, health services and security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This must stop now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Geneva-based WHO is the UN's health agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel bombarded Rafah on Wednesday as talks resumed in Cairo aimed at agreeing the terms of a truce in the seven-month war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed more than 34,800 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University in Washington DC on Wednesday and arrested demonstrators, hours after dozens marched to the home of the school’s president as city officials prepared to appear before Congress on the protest’s handling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith were called to testify on Wednesday afternoon at the Republican-led House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, but the hearing was cancelled after the arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters of the Israel-Hamas war on campuses across the United States, and increasingly in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges cracked down immediately. Others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District of Columbia police said officers moved to disperse demonstrators because “there has been a gradual escalation in the volatility of the protest.” It said 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Some protesters were pepper sprayed as police blocked them from the camp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  George Washington University had warned of possible suspensions for continuing the camp on University Yard. Protesters carrying signs that read, “Free Palestine” and “Hands off Rafah,” also marched to school President Ellen Granberg’s home on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While the university is committed to protecting students’ rights to free expression, the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations,” a school statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In France, police detained 86 people following an operation to remove students staging a pro-Palestinian occupation at the Sorbonne university in Paris, prosecutors said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those arrested in the police operation on Tuesday night were being held for a variety of public order offences, said the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include wilful damage, rebellion, violence against a person holding public authority, intrusion into an education establishment and holding a meeting designed to disrupt order. Some are also being held for participation in a group with a view to preparing violence or damage to property.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before police moved in, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said there would never be a right to disrupt France's universities with such protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, pro-Palestinian protesters built barricades at the University of Amsterdam, using desks and railings to block off the canalside entrance in the heart of the city as they vowed to stay put until the institution severs all ties with Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Riot police used a bulldozer to knock down barricades at another University of Amsterdam site on Tuesday and detained 169 people, but said the university had not yet asked for similar intervention on Wednesday. (Agencies)

    Hottest April on record last month: EU climate monitor

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Scientists have already confirmed that climate change caused some specific weather extremes in April. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752266_1_20240508104826.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's climate monitor on Wednesday said last month was the hottest April on record and the 11th consecutive month of historic global heat.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oceans were also overheating with April marking the 13th straight monthly high for sea surface temperatures, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each month since June 2023 has ranked as the planet's hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, the C3S said in a monthly bulletin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including April, the world's average temperature was the highest on record for a 12-month period - 1.61 degrees Celsius above the average in the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the extremes - including months of record breaking sea surface temperatures - have led scientists to investigate whether human activity has now triggered a tipping point in the climate system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think many scientists have asked the question whether there could be a shift in the climate system," said Julien Nicolas, C3S Senior Climate Scientist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the EU's climate monitor also said the natural El Nino phenomenon which warms the Pacific Ocean and contributes to hotter weather globally "continued to weaken" in April towards more "neutral conditions". (Reuters/AFP)

 Protests by students demanding universities sever ties with Israel over the Gaza war spread across western Europe on Tuesday, sparking clashes and dozens of fresh arrests.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Students at various European universities, inspired by ongoing demonstrations at US campuses, have been occupying halls and facilities, demanding an end to partnerships with Israeli institutions because of Israel's punishing assault on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several hundred protesters resumed a demonstration around the University of Amsterdam campus, where police the previous night were filmed baton-charging them and smashing up their tents after they refused to leave the grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protests resumed on Tuesday night, demonstrators erected barriers to access routes watched over by a heavy police deployment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said in a statement that a total of 169 people had been arrested when officers broke up Monday night's protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All had been released apart from two still in custody on suspicion of public disorder offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Violence had briefly erupted Monday when a small group of counter-protesters wielding flares stormed the main protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50 demonstrators were also protesting Tuesday outside the library in Utrecht University and a few dozen at the Technical University of Delft, according to local news agency ANP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the eastern German city of Leipzig, the university said in a statement that 50 to 60 people occupied a lecture hall on Tuesday, waving banners that read: "University occupation against genocide".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters barricaded the lecture hall doors from the inside and erected tents in the courtyard, according to the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institution called in the police in the afternoon, and filed a criminal complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Criminal proceedings have been initiated against 13 people who were in the lecture hall on suspicion of trespassing. No arrests have been made so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, at Berlin's Free University, police cleared a demonstration after up to 80 people erected a protest camp in a courtyard of the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protesters, some of whom wore the keffiyeh scarf that has long been a symbol of the Palestinian cause, sat in front of tents and waved banners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They later tried to enter rooms and lecture halls and occupy them, according to the university, which said it then called in police to clear the protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said property was damaged while classes in some buildings were suspended for the day. Berlin police said they made some arrests for incitement to hatred and trespassing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Paris, police twice intervened at the prestigious Sciences Po university to disperse about 20 students who had barricaded themselves in the main hall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Security forces moved in to allow other students to take their exams and made two arrests, according to Paris prosecutors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university said exams proceeded without incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the nearby Sorbonne university building, police late Tuesday moved to eject about 100 students who had occupied an amphitheatre and made 88 arrests, police sources said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Switzerland, protests spread to three universities in Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Lausanne said in a statement it "considers that there is no reason to cease these relations" with Israeli universities as protesters demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Austria, dozens of protesters have been camped on the campus of Vienna University, pitching tents and stringing up banners since late Thursday. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in riot gear cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Chicago on Tuesday after administrators who had initially adopted a permissive approach said the protest had crossed a line and caused growing concerns about safety.
 <br>
  <br/>
  University president Paul Alivisatos issued a message after officers blocked access to the school's Quad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The university remains a place where dissenting voices have many avenues to express themselves, but we cannot enable an environment where the expression of some dominates and disrupts the healthy functioning of the community for the rest,” he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of protesters had gathered for at least eight days at the university until campus administrators warned them on Friday to leave the area or face removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, law enforcement dismantled the encampment. Officers later picked up a barricade erected to keep protesters out of the Quad and moved it toward the demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation!”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions have continued to ratchet up in standoffs with protesters on campuses across the US — and increasingly, in Europe — nearly three weeks into a movement launched by a protest at Columbia University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some colleges have cracked down immediately on protests against the Israel-Hamas war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since April 18, just over 2,600 people have been arrested on the campuses of 50 colleges and universities, according to figures based on reporting by the Associated Press and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As pro-Palestinian protests continue to spread, the White House said President Joe Biden welcomes peaceful protests at college commencement ceremonies where he and other administration officials will speak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest," she added. "What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden last week addressed the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest "but not a right to cause chaos" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses. (Agencies)

    UN atomic chief bemoans lack of cooperation from Iran

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Rafael Grossi held talks with Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation head Mohammad Eslami. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752216_1_20240508030843.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi on Tuesday decried "completely unsatisfactory" cooperation from Tehran after returning from Iran where he urged leaders to adopt "concrete" measures to address concerns over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Grossi's visit came at a time of heightened regional tensions and with his International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) criticising Iran for lack of cooperation on inspections and other outstanding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The present state is completely unsatisfactory for me. We are almost at an impasse and this needs to be changed," Grossi told reporters at the airport in Vienna, where the IAEA is based.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there was no "magic wand" to solve a "very, very complex set of issues," while he pressed the Islamic republic to "deliver very soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But of course, for me and also I would say for the international community, there is a need to have some results sooner rather than later," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Tuesday, at a news conference in the Iranian city of Isfahan, Grossi said he had proposed to Iranian officials that they "focus on the very concrete, very practical and tangible measures that can be implemented in order to accelerate" cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi held talks with senior Iranian officials including Atomic Energy Organisation's head Mohammad Eslami and spoke at Iran's first International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology held in Isfahan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi insisted on the need to "settle differences" on the nuclear issue while the Middle East was going through "difficult times", particularly the war between Israel and the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes, political conditions pose obstacles to full-fledged cooperation" between Iran and the international community, Grossi told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Grossi said a March 2023 agreement with Iran was "still valid" but required more "substance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement was reached during Grossi's last visit to Iran and outlined basic cooperation measures including on safeguards and monitoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IAEA chief said, however, that there had been a "slowdown" in the agreement's implementation, including Iran reducing the number of inspections and withdrawing the accreditation of a group of IAEA experts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran suspended compliance with a landmark 2015 deal setting caps on nuclear activities after the United States unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sweeping sanctions. (AFP)

    Canadian police probe shooting near Drake's home

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752210_1_20240508011635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police on Tuesday were investigating a pre-dawn shooting at the home of superstar rapper Drake, whose sprawling property in a tiny Toronto neighbourhood remained cordoned off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police inspector Paul Krawczyk said a security guard at the mansion on The Bridle Path road was taken to hospital with serious injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound after suspects in a vehicle opened fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting, captured on grainy security camera footage that has not been released to the public, happened at 2:09 am (0609 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The guard was standing outside the gates in front of the residence when the shooting occurred, Krawczyk told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I cannot confirm if Drake was home at the time the incident occurred, but I can tell you that we are in contact with his team and they are cooperating," the inspector added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the suspects fled in the vehicle, but no descriptions were offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police taped off most of the area. Several small orange markers, believed to indicate locations of shell casings, could be seen scattered on the road's edge in front of the mansion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Drake, known for hits such as "God's Plan" and "Hotline Bling," was the highest-grossing rapper in the world last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is currently embroiled in a feud with Kendrick Lamar, with the rappers exchanging barbed "diss tracks" that have drawn widespread attention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beefs are nothing new in hip-hop, a genre long known both for its artists' boasts and their strongly worded takedowns of rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no indication that the shooting had any relation to the rap battle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the bad blood between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, Krawczyk said he was aware of it, but added, "it is so early in the investigation that we don't have a motive at this time, and so I cannot comment further on that." (AFP)

    Stormy Daniels takes witness stand at Trump trial

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the heart of Donald Trump's hush money case, took the witness stand on Tuesday at the blockbuster trial of the former US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The people call Stormy Daniels," prosecutor Susan Hoffinger announced as the 77-year-old Trump sat at the defence table in the Manhattan courtroom flanked by his lawyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels' testimony is expected to be a pivotal moment in the courtroom drama rocking the scandal-plagued Republican's attempt to recapture the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniels, 45, a long-time actor and director in the adult film industry, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006 and was then paid to keep quiet about it on the eve of his 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, when the news could have sunk his campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump denies ever having sex with Daniels and Susan Necheles, a lawyer for the former president, lodged an objection with the judge presiding over the trial to allowing her to testify about any "sexual acts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unduly prejudicial," Necheles told Judge Juan Merchan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hoffinger said Daniels' testimony would not be graphic and would "omit details that are too salacious."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors say that Trump – desperate to kill Daniels' story before it could wreck his chances in the narrow 2016 race – illegally reimbursed his fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover up the US$130,000 hush money payment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cohen, who has become a vocal critic of his former boss, is also expected to testify at the trial as a prosecution witness. (AFP)

    Macron hosts Xi Jinping in French mountains

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German police on Tuesday broke up a protest by several hundred pro-Palestinian activists who had occupied a courtyard at Berlin’s Free University earlier in the day, the latest such action by authorities as protests that have roiled campuses in the United States spread across Europe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The protesters had put up about 20 tents and formed a human chain around them. Most had covered their faces with medical masks and had draped kufiyah scarves around their heads, shouting slogans such as “Viva, viva Palestina”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had called on the students via loudspeakers to leave the campus, and officers could also be seen carrying some students away, and using pepper spray against some of the protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's administrators said in a statement that the protesters had rejected any kind of dialogue and they had therefore called in police to clear the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This form of protest is not geared towards dialogue. An occupation is not acceptable on the Free University Berlin campus,” university president Guenter Ziegler said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administrators said some protesters attempted to enter rooms and lecture halls at Free University in order to occupy them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent days, students have held protests or set up encampments in Finland, Denmark, Italy, Spain, France and Britain, following earlier protests at US campuses. (AP)

    Vladimir Putin inaugurated as Russian president

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vladimir Putin began his fifth term on Tuesday as Russian leader at a glittering Kremlin inauguration, setting out on another six years in office.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Already in office for nearly a quarter-century, and the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, Putin’s new term doesn’t expire until 2030, when he will be constitutionally eligible to run again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the ceremony inside the gilded Grand Kremlin Palace, Putin placed his hand on the Russian Constitution and vowed to defend it as a crowd of hand-picked dignitaries looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 71, Putin dominates the domestic political landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the international stage, he is locked in a confrontation with Western countries he accuses of using Ukraine as a vehicle to try to defeat and dismember Russia.

  Putin in March won a landslide victory in a tightly controlled election from which two anti-war candidates were barred on technical grounds.

  His best known opponent, Alexei Navalny, died suddenly in an Arctic penal colony a month earlier, and other leading critics are in jail or have been forced to flee abroad.

 Dutch riot police ended a pro-Palestinian demonstration at an Amsterdam university early on Tuesday, arresting some 125 people in sometimes violent clashes, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In messages posted overnight on social media X, police said they had to act to stop the event and dismantle tents that been set up by protesters, who used violence against police at the site at the University of Amsterdam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police's input was necessary to restore order. We see the footage on social media. We understand that those images may appear as intense," police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media showed demonstrators shooting fireworks at police officers but there were no immediate reports of injuries on either side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All is now quiet... police stay in the vicinity of the Roeterseiland campus," police said later on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outgoing Education minister Robbert Dijkgraaf said universities are a place for dialogue and debate and he was sad to see that police had to intervene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student protests over the war and academic ties with Israel have begun to spread across Europe, but have remained much smaller in scale than those seen in the United States. (Reuters)

    Israel says it is 'in control' of key Gaza crossing

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752143_1_20240507144135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said it took "operational control" of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Tuesday and that troops were scanning the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Right now we have special forces scanning the crossing... We have operational control of the area and other crossings and we have special forces scanning the area," the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are only talking about the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli 401st Brigade entered the Rafah crossing early Tuesday morning, the Israeli military said, taking “operational control” of the crucial crossing for both aid and those able to flee into Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage released by the Israeli military showed a tank entering the crossing. Details of the video matched known features of the crossing and showed Israeli flags flying from tanks that seized the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military claimed it seized the crossing after receiving intelligence it was “being used for terrorist purposes.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military did not provide evidence to immediately support the assertion, though it alleged the area around the crossing had been used to launch a mortar attack that killed four Israeli troops and wounded others near the Kerem Shalom Crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military also said that ground troops and airstrikes targeted suspected Hamas positions in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt previously warned any seizure of Rafah could see Palestinians fleeing over the border, a scenario that could threaten a 1979 peace deal with Israel that’s been a linchpin for regional security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The offensive again raised the risks of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egyptian officials said the proposal called for a cease-fire of multiple stages starting with a limited hostage release and partial Israeli troop pullbacks within Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides would also negotiate a “permanent calm” that would lead to a full hostage release and greater Israeli withdrawal out of the territory, they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas militant group, which controls Gaza, has sought clearer guarantees for its key demand of an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal in return for the release of all hostages. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian woman, accused of killing her in-laws with a toxic mushroom-laced beef Wellington, pleaded not guilty to a raft of murder charges on Tuesday, court officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Erin Patterson faces three counts of murder for allegedly dishing up a poisonous meal in July 2023 that killed her parents-in-law, as well as the wife of a local pastor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 49-year-old, who is also accused of attempting to kill her estranged husband four times, indicated to a Melbourne court that she would fight the charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Court officials said the case, which has captured headlines around the world, would now be fast-tracked for trial at the Supreme Court of Victoria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patterson allegedly served the beef Wellington to her estranged parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, as well as local Baptist pastor Ian Wilkinson, 69, and his wife Heather Wilkinson, 66.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have previously suggested the meal she served included lethal death cap mushrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three of the lunch guests -- Don and Gail Patterson, and Heather Wilkinson -- died in the days following the meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ian Wilkinson recovered after spending nearly two months in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Detectives said husband Simon Patterson also "became ill after meals" served by his estranged wife on four separate occasions in 2021 and 2022 -- and have charged Erin Patterson with his attempted murder. (AFP)

    Boeing Starliner spaceship launch postponed
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1752092-20240507.htm

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The postponement was announced about two hours before blast-off. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752092_1_20240507090426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically postponed around two hours before launch after a new safety issue was identified, officials said Monday, in a fresh blow to the US aerospace giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were already strapped in their seats preparing for lift-off when the call for a "scrub" came, in order to give engineers time to investigate anomalous readings from an oxygen relief valve on the second stage of the rocket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Standing down on tonight's attempt to launch," tweeted NASA chief Bill Nelson. "As I've said before, @NASA's first priority is safety. We go when we're ready."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission comes at a challenging time for Boeing, as a safety crisis engulfs its commercial aviation division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The test flight, which has already experienced years of delays, is a crucial step for the space agency, which has long sought a second commercial partner to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX achieved the feat with its Dragon capsule in 2020, ending a nearly decade-long dependence on Russian rockets following the end of the Space Shuttle program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clad in Boeing's bright blue spacesuits, the astronauts were helped out of the spaceship then boarded a van to leave the launch tower at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, returning to their quarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next possible launch window is on Tuesday, then Friday and Saturday, assuming the issue is resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will be propelled into orbit by an Atlas V rocket made by United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture. Once in space, the crew will take the helm, piloting the craft manually to test its capabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts, both Navy-trained pilots and space program veterans, have each been to the ISS twice, traveling once on a shuttle and then aboard a Russian Soyuz vessel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner, a gumdrop-shaped capsule with a cabin about as roomy as an SUV, is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS for a week-long stay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams and Wilmore will conduct a series of tests to verify the capsule's functionality before returning to Earth for a parachute-assisted landing in the western United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by numerous setbacks in the Starliner programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, during a first uncrewed test flight, software defects meant the capsule was not placed on the right trajectory and returned without reaching the ISS. "Ground intervention prevented loss of vehicle," said NASA in the aftermath, chiding Boeing for inadequate safety checks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then in 2021, with the rocket on the launchpad for a new flight, blocked valves forced another postponement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel finally reached the ISS in May 2022 in a non-crewed launch. But other problems that came to light -- including weak parachutes and flammable tape in the cabin that needed to be removed -- caused further delays to the crewed test flight, necessary for the capsule to be certified for NASA use on regular ISS missions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX's Dragon capsule joined that exclusive club four years ago, following the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2014, the agency awarded fixed-price contracts of US$4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.6 billion to SpaceX to develop the capsules under its Commercial Crew Program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marked a shift in NASA's approach from owning space flight hardware to instead paying private partners for their services as the primary customer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took a swipe at Boeing, gloating that his company "finished 4 years sooner" despite receiving a smaller contract. He attributed Boeing's delay to "too many non-technical managers" in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once Starliner is fully operational, NASA hopes to alternate between SpaceX and Boeing vessels to taxi humans to the ISS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the orbital lab is due to be mothballed in 2030, both Starliner and Dragon could be used for future private space stations that several companies are developing. (AFP)

    Russia announces nuclear drills, threatens UK targets

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia announced on Monday that its troops stationed near Ukraine would run nuclear weapons drills and threatened to strike UK military targets outside the embattled country, citing what it said was an escalation in Western sabre-rattling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry announced the drills and also said Russian forces had captured two villages in eastern Ukraine, where outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian troops have been struggling to hold their positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in the border region of Belgorod meanwhile said that Ukrainian aerial attacks had left at least seven people dead and wounded over 30, including several children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin, who ordered the nuclear drills, has upped his nuclear rhetoric since ordering his army into Ukraine in 2022, warning in February there was a "real" risk of nuclear war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defence ministry gave no date for the exercises, but said they would involve the air force, navy and troops stationed near Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said they were aimed at ensuring Russian territorial integrity in the face of Western "threats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin specified that the exercises were a response to statements by French President Emmanuel Macron and British officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has in recent days hit out at Macron for telling The Economist magazine he was "not ruling anything out" in the West's response to the conflict in Ukraine, including sending troops to the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also blasted UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron for saying Kyiv has the right to strike targets inside Russia. (AFP)

    Biden speaks with Netanyahu as Rafah invasion looms

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden held urgent talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday after Israel defied repeated US warnings and told Palestinians to evacuate part of the southern Gaza city of Rafah ahead of an offensive.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call came as Biden mounts a diplomatic offensive to get ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas back on track, with Jordan's King Abdullah II due at the White House for lunch on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden told Netanyahu in April that invading Rafah would be a "mistake," and Washington has said it does not support an offensive without a credible plan to protect some 1.2 million civilians sheltering there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House confirmed that "President Biden spoke today with Prime Minister Netanyahu," and said it would release a readout with details of the call soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden did not respond to shouted questions and walked straight to the Oval Office from his helicopter, Marine One, after arriving back at the White House from a weekend at his family home in Wilmington, Delaware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the US National Security Council, announcing earlier that the call would take place, said "we have made our views clear on a major ground invasion of Rafah to the Israeli government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We continue to believe that a hostage deal is the best way to preserve the lives of the hostages, and avoid an invasion of Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Those talks are ongoing now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden is under growing domestic pressure about the war in Gaza in an election year, with pro-Palestinian protests roiling US university campuses in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New York's prestigious Columbia University, which has been at the heart of the protests, said on Monday it had canceled the main graduation ceremony for students next week. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scottish political veteran John Swinney on Monday was named head of the pro-independence SNP party, leaving him poised to become Scotland's new leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swinney, 60, said on X, formerly Twitter, he was "deeply honoured to have been elected as leader of the SNP" after Humza Yousaf resigned last week after little more than a year as Scottish leader and head of the Scottish National Party (SNP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNP confirmed Swinney's election after nominations for the post closed at noon (1100 GMT) without any other challengers emerging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters later that alongside advancing the case for Scottish independence his key policy idea was the eradication of child poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a curse and under my leadership I want to eradicate it in Scotland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On independence he said the party would "get our act together" to win back the votes of supporters who may have turned away from the party in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Humza stepped down last Monday as he faced a confidence vote in the Scottish parliament that he was set to lose having ditched his junior coalition partners, the Scottish Green Party, in a row over climate policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swinney, an old party hand who led the SNP from 2000 to 2004 when the nationalists were in opposition, will now face a vote in the Scottish parliament later this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he inherits a difficult political legacy, with former SNP leader and ally Nicola Sturgeon embroiled in a party funding scandal and a challenging domestic policy landscape. (AFP)

    Judge threatens Trump with jail

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial sanctioned him on Monday for violating his gag order again. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752053_1_20240506222820.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal trial on Monday said he would hold the former president in contempt of court for a 10th time for violating a gag order, and warned he would consider jailing him for any further violations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Justice Juan Merchan said the nine fines he had imposed so far did not seem to be deterring Trump from violating the gag order, which prohibits him from making public comments about jurors, witnesses and families of the judge and prosecutors if the statements mean to interfere with the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchan said he considered jail time “truly the last resort” for many reasons, including the disruption to the trial, the political implications of jailing a leading presidential candidate ahead of an election and the extraordinary security challenges of incarcerating an ex-president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said Trump’s “continued, willful” violations of the gag order amounted to a “direct attack on the rule of law.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday attended a China-France-EU trilateral meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said China regarded Europe as an important partner in helping it achieve its modernisation goals and said the two sides should stay committed to their partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president added China regarded Europe as a priority of its foreign policy, and sees China-EU relations from a strategic and long-term perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi's French counterpart, Macron, said the international situation made EU-China dialogue more essential than ever, adding it was important to ensure a level playing field between the two sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trade, Sino-European relations, the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East dominated talks between the three leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron said coordination with Beijing on "major crises" including Ukraine was "absolutely decisive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said China had been working "vigorously" to facilitate talks for peace in Ukraine while adding that Beijing was ready to work with the EU to support a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On trade, Macron urged "fair rules for all" while the EU's von der Leyen said relations between Brussels and Beijing were challenged over issues linked to market access.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said whether viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand, there was no such thing as "China's overcapacity problem". (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Israel tells Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli army said Monday it was evacuating about 100,000 people from eastern Rafah, ahead of an expected ground assault in the southern city of Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The estimate is around 100,000 people," a military spokesman told journalists when asked how many people were being evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 1.2 million people are currently sheltering in Rafah, according to the World Health Organisation, most having fled there from elsewhere in Gaza during the seven-month war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evacuation "is part of our plans to dismantle Hamas... we had a violent reminder of their presence and their operational abilities in Rafah yesterday," the military spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is an evacuation plan to get people out of harm's way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, three Israeli soldiers were killed and a dozen wounded, the army said, when a barrage of rockets was fired towards the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army said the rockets were fired from an area adjacent to Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The soldiers were hit while guarding heavy machinery, tanks and bulldozers stationed in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rain fell on Monday as the army airdropped leaflets advising about the evacuation, an AFP correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's armed wing claimed the rocket attack, which led Israeli authorities to close the crossing, used to deliver aid into Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eurovision 2024 began in the Swedish city of Malmo on Sunday when 37 contenders walked the "Turquoise Carpet" amid heightened security and calls for boycotts due to Israel's participation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 68th version of the song contest, which is always billed as non-political, is taking place against the backdrop of the devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much focus is expected to be on Israeli contestant Eden Golan, when she performs her song "Hurricane" in the second semi-final on Thursday, with bookmakers placing the entry among the top 10 to win the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli delegation did not attend the carpet on Sunday due to Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, said Swedish broadcaster SVT, which co-organises the contest with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel agreed to modify the lyrics of its original song "October Rain", which the EBU said made reference to the October 7 Hamas onslaught.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The contest comprises three live shows, with half a dozen countries having a shot at the title this year, according to fans and bookmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Loreen won the 2023 competition in Liverpool, northern England, with her song "Tattoo", granting the Nordic country an automatic entry into next Saturday's grand final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Big Five" of the EBU - the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy - are also automatically given a spot in the final, while the other contenders will compete in semi-finals for the remaining places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be the seventh time Sweden is hosting the song contest after last doing so in 2016, and the third time Malmo will stage the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's participants for this year, twins Marcus & Martinus, were drawn in March to open the final with their dance pop song "Unforgettable". (Reuters)

    Gaza ceasefire hopes fade amid impasse

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians look at the rubble left after an Israeli strike on a house in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751914_1_20240506005518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prospects for a Gaza ceasefire appeared slim on Sunday as Hamas reiterated its demand for an end to the war in exchange for the freeing of hostages, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flatly ruled that out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two sides blamed each other for the impasse and the Hamas delegation said it would leave Cairo truce talks on Sunday night to consult with its leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In their second day of talks with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, Hamas negotiators maintained their stance that any truce agreement must end the war, Palestinian officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli officials have not travelled to Cairo to take part in indirect diplomacy, but on Sunday Netanyahu reiterated Israel's aim since the start of the war nearly seven months ago: to disarm and dismantle the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas for good or else endanger Israel's future security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister said Israel was willing to pause fighting in Gaza in order to secure the release of hostages still being held by Hamas, believed to number more than 130.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But while Israel has shown willingness, Hamas remains entrenched in its extreme positions, first among them the demand to remove all our forces from the Gaza Strip, end the war, and leave Hamas in power," Netanyahu said. "Israel cannot accept that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indicating that this round of talks may soon unwind, a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters on Sunday: "If Netanyahu doesn't change his mind, there will be no reason to stay. They can always reconvene if that changes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The latest round of mediation in Cairo is near to collapse," one official briefed on the talks told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas did not seem to be serious about reaching a truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are observing worrying signs that Hamas does not intend to reach an agreement with us," Gallant said. "This means strong military action in Rafah will begin in the very near future, and in the rest of the Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released shortly after Netanyahu's, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group was still keen on reaching a comprehensive ceasefire that ends the Israeli "aggression", guarantees Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, and achieves "a serious" deal to free Israelis being held hostage in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh blamed Netanyahu for "the continuation of the aggression and the expansion of the circle of conflict, and sabotaging the efforts made through the mediators and various parties".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began after Hamas stunned Israel with a cross-border raid on October 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 252 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed, 29 of them in the past 24 hours, and more than 77,000 have been wounded in Israel's assault, according to Gaza's health ministry. The bombardment has devastated much of the coastal enclave and caused a humanitarian crisis. (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751888_1_20240505174332.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raging floods and mudslides this past week have killed at least 55 people in southern Brazil and forced nearly 70,000 to flee their homes, the country's civil defence agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said least 74 people were injured and another 67 were missing from the catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-rising water levels in the state of Rio Grande do Sul were straining dams and threatening the economically important city of Porto Alegre, home to some 1.4 million residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guaiba River, which flows through the city, was at a historic high of 5.04 metres, well above the 4.76 metres that had stood as a record since the devastating floods of 1941.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities scrambled to evacuate swamped neighbourhoods as rescue workers used four-wheel-drive vehicles -- and even jet skis -- to move through waist-deep water in search of the stranded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence officials also said more than a million people lacked access to potable water amid the flooding, describing damage as incalculable. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian police said on Sunday they had shot dead a boy after he stabbed a man in Western Australia's capital Perth, in an attack authorities said indicated terrorism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were signs the 16-year-old, armed with a kitchen knife, had been radicalised online, state authorities said, adding they received calls from concerned members of the local Muslim community before the attack, which occurred late on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack, in the suburb of Willetton, had "hallmarks" of terrorism but was yet to be declared a terrorist act, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone," Western Australia Premier Roger Cook told a televised press conference in the state capital Perth, regarding the attacker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victim, stabbed in the back, was stable in hospital, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the incident by police and intelligence agencies, which advised there was no ongoing threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia," Albanese said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offences in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney, on April 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the bishop came only days after a stabbing spree killed six in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to the federal government. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour leader Keir Starmer has hailed a swing to Labour, just five years after the party was trounced by the Conservatives. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751833_1_20240505020621.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's ruling Conservatives on Saturday braced for further losses in local elections, their worst results in recent memory and a key test before a general election to be held by January.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's party lost nearly 500 councillors and control of 12 councils as well as a parliamentary seat, after voting on Thursday across a swathe of England saw the Labour opposition make huge gains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The beleaguered Tory leader faces more likely defeats when results of crunch mayoral races -- in London, Liverpool and Manchester -- are announced later, but is hoping to retain the West Midlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare success on Friday, a Tory mayor won a third term in Tees Valley, northeast England -- albeit with a vastly reduced majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour, out of power since 2010 and trounced by Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election in 2019, seized on its claim to the Blackpool South seat in parliament and other successes to demand a national vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's turn the page on decline," Labour leader Keir Starmer told supporters on Saturday in the East Midlands, where the party won the mayoral race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak must order a general election be held by January 28 next year at the latest, and has said he is planning on a poll in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, Sunak conceded the returns showed "voters are frustrated" but insisted "Labour is not winning in places they admit they need for a majority".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We Conservatives have everything to fight for," Sunak concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour has enjoyed double-digit poll leads for all of Sunak's 18 months in charge, as previous scandals, a cost-of-living crisis and various other issues dent the Tories' standing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, they were defending nearly 1,000 council seats, many secured in 2021 when they led nationwide polls before the implosion of Johnson's premiership and his successor Liz Truss's disastrous 49-day tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With almost all those results in by Saturday morning, they had lost close to half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If replicated in a nationwide contest, the initial tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points, according to the BBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky News' projection for a general election using the results predicted Labour will be the largest party but short of an overall majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its by-election scalp in Blackpool -- on a mammoth 26-percent swing -- was the Conservatives' 11th such loss in this parliament, the most by any government since the late 1960s. (AFP)

 Turkey said on Friday it will not resume trade with Israel, worth US$7 billion a year, until a permanent ceasefire and humanitarian aid are secured in Gaza, becoming the first of Israel's key commercial partners to take such a step.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's "uncompromising attitude" and the worsening situation in Gaza's Rafah region, a refuge for displaced people that Israel has threatened to storm - prompted Ankara to halt all exports and imports, Trade Minister Omer Bolat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz criticised Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's move, enacted late on Thursday, saying it breaks international trade agreements and was "how a dictator behaves".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, praised the decision as brave and supportive of Palestinian rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Turkey curbed exports of steel, fertiliser and jet fuel among 54 product categories over what it said was Israel's refusal to allow Ankara to take part in aid air-drop operations for Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new ban covers all remaining trade, amounting to US$5.4 billion in Turkish exports - or nearly 6 percent of all of Israel's imports - and US$1.6 billion in imports to Turkey last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top Turkish exports to Israel are steel, vehicles, plastics, electrical devices and machinery, while imports are dominated by fuels at US$634 million last year, Turkish trade data show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey has denounced Israel's military campaign in Gaza, sent thousands of tons of aid for Gazans and, this week, said it would join South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel denies committing acts of genocide in Gaza or violating humanitarian law there. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Friday awarded the country's top civilian honour to Oscar-winning Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh and 18 other people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a ceremony at the White House, the 81-year-old Biden presented Yeoh and other winners with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by placing the award around their necks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House praised Yeoh for continuing to "shatter stereotypes and enrich American culture," as the 61-year-old actress became the first Asian woman to win the best actress Oscar for her performance in "Everything Everywhere All at Once" last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners of the Presidential Medal of Freedom include Biden's Democratic allies - former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, former vice president Al Gore, former secretary of state John Kerry, and former New York mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said the winners have made exemplary contributions to the US, and the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are the pinnacle of leadership in their fields. They consistently demonstrated over their careers the power of community, hard work, and service." Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden himself received the medal of freedom days before former US president Donald Trump entered the White House in January 2017. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Canada charges Indian trio over Sikh activist murder

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police said on Friday they had arrested and charged three Indian nationals with the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 and said they were probing possible links to the Indian government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, 45, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said the matter was still under investigation and other probes were being carried out. These "include investigating connections to the government of India," he told a televised news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a "terrorist".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States. (Reuters)

    Flood-ravaged Kenya braces for first ever cyclone

    <![CDATA[<img alt="William Rutto warns in an address to the nation that Kenya's severe weather is likely to continue. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751706_1_20240504012715.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and landslides across Kenya in recent weeks, killing at least 210 people, are forecast to worsen over the rest of this month, President William Ruto said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The floods have wreaked havoc, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other infrastructure across Kenya, East Africa's largest economy. The death toll exceeds that from floods triggered by the El Nino weather phenomenon late last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sadly, we have not seen the last of this perilous period, as the situation is expected to escalate. Meteorological reports paint a dire picture," Ruto said on Kenyan television. "Kenya may face its first-ever cyclone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyclone Hidaya is expected to make landfall in Tanzania, Kenya's southern neighbour, on Saturday, bringing with it waves almost eight metres high and 165 kph winds, the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Floods have killed more than 160 people in Tanzania since the beginning of April, Tanzania's government spokesman Mobhare Matinyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This cyclone, named Hidaya, that could hit anytime now, is predicted to cause torrential rain, strong winds and powerful and dangerous waves," Ruto said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Ruto ordered those living in landslide-prone areas to leave for safer ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has asked people living near 178 dams and water reservoirs, now close to overflowing, as well as those in informal settlements close to rivers and streams, to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said the reopening of all schools for the upcoming term, which was meant to start this week, would be postponed until further notice. (Reuters)

    Orangutan seen apparently treating wound

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A male Sumatran orangutan named Rakus is seen two months after wound self-treatment using a medicinal plant. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751628_1_20240503133421.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists have observed an orangutan applying medicinal herbs to a face wound in an apparently successful attempt to heal an injury, the first time such behaviour has been recorded.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Primates have previously been seen eating plants or rubbing them on themselves in behaviour scientists theorised was intended to ward off disease or discomfort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the apparent treatment seen by researchers in Indonesia in 2022, and reported in the journal Nature Scientific Reports on Thursday, is the first time a wild animal has been seen applying medicinal plants to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists were tracking a male orangutan nicknamed Rakus at the Gunung Leuser National Park in Indonesia's Aceh province when they noticed an open wound on his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three days later, they spotted him chewing the leaves of a vine called Fibraurea tinctoria, which is known for its medicinal properties and has long been used in local traditional medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The orangutan "began chewing the leaves without swallowing them and using his fingers to apply the plant juice from his mouth directly onto his facial wound," said the study by Indonesian and German scientists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When flies began to land on the site, Rakus "smeared the entire wound with the plant pulp until the red flesh was fully covered with the green leaf material."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next day, Rakus was seen eating the vine's leaves again, and a week later his wound had closed up, subsequently healing without any sign of infection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study describes the behaviour as the "first systematically documented case of active wound treatment with a plant species known to contain biologically active substances by a wild animal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said it was impossible to be sure the behaviour was intentional, but the fact that the juice and leaves were applied repeatedly and only to the wound suggests Rakus was trying to treat his injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They speculate the orangutan could have stumbled across the treatment, perhaps by first chewing the plant and then finding the juice offered pain relief when accidently touching it to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orangutans are known to learn skills from each other through observation, but the scientists said they had no record of similar behaviour in 21 years and 28,000 observation hours in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rakus however had moved to the region from elsewhere, raising the possibility he learned the medical technique from a different community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observation adds to a growing body of evidence about the way primates use plants to keep healthy, including swallowing whole leaves that have anti-parasitic properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in Indonesia, orangutans have been seen rubbing the chewed leaves of a different plant into their skin, possibly to harness its anti-inflammatory properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in 2022, scientists reported on chimpanzees in Gabon that were seen apparently applying insects to wounds. (AFP)

    Boris Johnson caught out by his own photo ID law

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British prime minister Boris Johnson, who introduced a contentious requirement for voters to show photo ID while voting, was turned away from a polling station on Thursday for forgetting to bring his.
 <br>
  <br/>
  British media reported that Johnson, who quit in 2022 following a scandal-ridden premiership, was initially turned away at a polling station in Oxfordshire, southern England, while trying to vote in local elections taking place across England on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said Johnson had voted Conservative but did not deny that the ex-PM had initially failed to produce photo ID.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As prime minister, Johnson's government introduced the ID requirement in 2022 to crack down on possible voter fraud but it was heavily criticised for the potential to disenfranchise parts of the electorate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously, voters only needed to give their name and address to be able to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it's unreasonable to ask first-time voters to produce some evidence of identity," Johnson had said of the new rules in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, in the first vote where the new rules were implemented, around 14,000 people in England were denied a vote in local elections after being unable to provide ID.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident is the latest in what has been a colourful political career for Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As London mayor he was once left dangling in the air when he got stranded on a zip wire, and as prime minister he was once pictured appearing to retreat into a large refrigerator while being pursued by a camera crew for an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A poll by YouGov showed 14 percent of Britons were still unaware, in the days prior to Thursday's elections, of the voter ID requirement. (Reuters)

 Thousands of demonstrators blocked a key intersection in Georgia's capital of Tbilisi on Thursday, as protests against a law on "foreign agents" in the country continue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The protesters blocked Heroes' Square through which moves most of the traffic between the city's neighbourhoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia's parliament on Wednesday approved the second reading of a bill on "foreign agents" that has been criticised as Kremlin-inspired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence, has sparked a political crisis in the South Caucasus country. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump said he may not accept the 2024 election results in Wisconsin, a key battleground state in his matchup with US President Joe Biden, leaving open the possibility of post-election turmoil.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Wednesday, Trump said that if he doesn’t believe the result in November's election was legitimate, “you have to fight for the right of the country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump added, “If everything’s honest, I will absolutely accept the results.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican presidential candidate's comments came on the heels of an interview this week with Time magazine in which Trump did not rule out the possibility of political violence around the election, saying “it depends on the fairness” of the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Journal Sentinel interview, Trump reiterated his claim that he won Wisconsin – a Midwestern state he lost to Biden, a Democrat, by about 21,000 votes in 2020 – and that the election was tainted by fraud. Trump's campaign unsuccessfully sought to disqualify almost 240,000 ballots cast for Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump won Wisconsin over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, and his rematch this year with Biden is expected to be tight. He held campaign rallies on Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan, another battleground state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said in the newspaper interview he won’t hesitate to raise doubts about the election if he’s convinced something is amiss with the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd be doing a disservice to the country if I said otherwise," Trump said. "But no, I expect an honest election and we expect to win maybe very big." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden broke his silence on campus unrest over the war in Gaza on Thursday, saying Americans have the right to demonstrate but not to unleash violence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There is a right to protest, but not a right to cause chaos," Biden said in remarks at the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With television images of campus unrest that have swept the country in recent days playing out on news networks, Biden has faced criticism of his handling of the situation. He had been leaving it largely up to his spokespeople to comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democratic president, seeking re-election in November, has walked a careful line of denouncing antisemitism while supporting young Americans' right to protest and trying to limit longer-term political damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said both sides had a point, that peaceful dissent was critical to a democracy but that violence would not be tolerated.

  "Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelling of classes and graduations -none of this is a peaceful protest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said the United States was not an authoritarian nation that silences critics but that "order must prevail."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Dissent is essential to democracy but dissent must never lead to disorder or denying the rights of others so students can't finish the semester and college education," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, asked whether state governors should call in National Guard troops to restore order if necessary, replied "no."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to a reporter's question, Biden said the campus protests had not forced him to reconsider his policies in the Middle East.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of helmeted police swarmed the site of a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of California at Los Angeles early on Thursday, arresting demonstrators and dismantling their encampment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pre-dawn police crackdown at UCLA marked the latest flashpoint in mounting tensions on US college campuses, where protests over Israel's war in Gaza have led to student clashes with each other and with law enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to moving in, police urged demonstrators in repeated loudspeaker announcements to clear the protest zone, which occupied a central plaza about the size of a football field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After massing around the campus for hours, officers eventually moved through the area in lines holding batons as protesters - some in white helmets - linked arms, attempting to block their advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live TV footage showed officers taking down tents and removing the encampment, while arrested protesters sat with their hands restrained behind their backs with zip-ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students have rallied or set up tent encampments at dozens of universities in recent days, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and demanding schools divest from companies that support Israel's government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many colleges, including Columbia University in New York City, have called in police to quell the protests. (Reuters)

    Jeremiah Manele named as new Solomon Islands PM

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751503_1_20240502160742.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Solomon Islands lawmakers selected Jeremiah Manele as their new prime minister on Thursday, elevating the former foreign minister who had pledged to continue the Pacific Island nation's international policy that drew it closer to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Governor General Sir David Vunagi announced outside parliament house that Manele won 31 votes to opposition leader Matthew Wales' 18 votes in the 50-seat parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A national election last month saw incumbent Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare's government lose half of its seats but failed to deliver a majority to any political party. The government and opposition parties lobbied intensively for weeks to win support from independents ahead of the vote for prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police boosted security in the capital Honiara as newly elected lawmakers arrived at parliament on Thursday to vote in a secret ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election was closely watched by China, the US and neighbouring Australia because of the potential impact on regional security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he looked forward to working closely with Manele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australia and Solomon Islands are close friends and our futures are connected," he wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's embassy said in a Facebook post it looked forward to working with Manele to develop "China-Solomon Islands relations". (Reuters)

    Bogota cuts ties with Israel over 'genocide' in Gaza

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on Wednesday his country will sever diplomatic ties with Israel, whose leader he described as "genocidal" over its war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow (Thursday) diplomatic relations with the state of Israel will be severed... for having a genocidal president," Petro, a harsh critic of the war against Hamas, told a May Day rally in Bogota, referring to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's foreign minister on Wednesday said Petro's decision to cut diplomatic ties amounted to handing a "reward" to Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Petro has taken a critical stance on the Gaza assault that followed an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 -- which resulted in the deaths of some 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In October, just days after the start of the war, Israel said it was "halting security exports" to Colombia after Petro accused Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of using language about the people of Gaza similar to what the "Nazis said of the Jews."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel accused Petro of "expressing support for the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists, fueling anti-Semitism," and summoned Colombia's ambassador.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, one of the main providers of arms to Colombia's military, then said it was "halting security exports" to the South American country as the diplomatic feud escalated. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkish police on Wednesday fired tear gas and rubber bullets and detained more than 200 protesters after authorities banned May 1 rallies at Istanbul's historic Taksim Square.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 police were deployed across Istanbul, blocking even small sidestreets with metal barriers in an attempt to prevent protesters gathering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police clashed with demonstrators near city hall in the Sarachane district, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to stop protesters breaching barricades, AFP reporters said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "210 people were detained in Istanbul after failure to heed our warnings and attempting to walk to the Taksim Square and attack our police officers on May 1 Labour and Solidarity Day," Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tall metal barriers were put up around the square, where authorities have banned rallies since 2013, when it was the focus of demonstrations against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have demonstrated our will to celebrate May Day at Taksim Square. We have legal grounds," Arzu Cerkezoglu, secretary general of the Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey (DISK) told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taksim is an important symbol for us. Taksim means May Day, Taksim means labour," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, Turkey's top constitutional court ruled that the closure of Taksim Square for protests was a violation of rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The square was a rallying ground for May Day celebrations until 1977, when at least 34 people were killed during demonstrations. Authorities opened it up again in 2010, but it was shut again after the 2013 protests. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="NYPD officers arrest a student as they evict a building that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian student protesters at Columbia University. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751343_1_20240501105700.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nation's human rights chief has voiced concern over heavy-handed steps to remove protesters from university campuses in the United States where pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been taking place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statement comes as dozens of helmeted police on Tuesday night marched onto Columbia University in New York City – the epicentre of the student protests – and began evicting a building that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian student protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to society – particularly when there is sharp disagreement on major issues,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It continued by saying that many of the protests have been held without incident and that at a number of locations, they have been dispersed or dismantled by security forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of students have been arrested, while others face charges or academic sanctions, the statement said, adding that enforcement actions by universities or law enforcement to restrict such expression "need to be carefully scrutinised".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement continued by quoting Türk as saying: “I am concerned that some of [the] law enforcement actions across a series of universities appear disproportionate in their impacts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations – the most sweeping and prolonged unrest to rock US college campuses since the Vietnam war protests of the 1960s and 70s – have posed a challenge to university administrators trying to balance free speech rights with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unrest has swept through US higher education institutions like wildfire, with many student protesters erecting tent encampments on campuses from coast to coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage of police in riot gear summoned at various colleges has been viewed around the world. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Binance chief Zhao jailed for four months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Changpeng Zhao arrives for his sentencing hearing in Seattle. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751333_1_20240501094516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Changpeng Zhao, the former chief executive of Binance, was sentenced on Tuesday to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Once considered the most powerful crypto industry figure, Zhao, known as "CZ," is the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle was significantly shorter than the three years sought by prosecutors, and below the maximum one and a half years recommended under federal guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also much lighter than the 25 years behind bars that Sam Bankman-Fried received in March for stealing US$8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, prosecutors cheered the outcome of what had been a years-long investigation into Binance and Zhao, a billionaire who had been living beyond US reach in the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was an epic day,” US Attorney Tessa Gorman told reporters outside the courthouse. “Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before handing down the sentence, Jones faulted Zhao for making Binance's growth and profitability a higher priority than complying with US laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You had the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to make sure that every single regulation had to be complied with, and so you failed at that opportunity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhao, 47, did not visibly react upon hearing his sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "'Crime pays' is the message sent today," Dennis Kelleher, head of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in an email, noting Zhao will still get to keep his vast wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors said Binance employed a "Wild West" model that welcomed criminals, and did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm sorry," Zhao told the judge before being sentenced. (Reuters)

    Georgia police break up 'foreign agents' law protest

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police use water cannon to disperse protesters in Tbilisi. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751328_1_20240501090726.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgian security forces used water cannon, tear gas and stun grenades against protesters outside parliament late on Tuesday, sharply escalating a crackdown after lawmakers debated a "foreign agents" bill which is viewed by the opposition and Western nations as authoritarian and Russian-inspired.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses said they saw some police officers physically attack protesters, who threw eggs and bottles at them, before using tear gas, water cannon and stun grenades to force demonstrators from the area outside the parliament building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Levan Khabeishvili, the leader of Georgia's largest opposition party, the United National Movement, posted a picture on X with his face bloodied and sporting a black eye. A party official said Khabeishvili was beaten by police after disappearing from central Tbilisi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After being dispersed from parliament, around two thousand protesters continued to block Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue, barricading it with cafe tables and rubbish bins. Some shouted "Slaves" and "Russians" at police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, riot police used pepper spray and batons to clear some protesters who were trying to prevent lawmakers from leaving the back entrance of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili,  whose powers are mostly ceremonial, said in a post on X the crackdown had been "totally unwarranted, unprovoked and out of proportion," and that the protests had been peaceful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill has heightened divisions in the southern Caucasus country, setting the ruling Georgian Dream party against a protest movement backed by opposition groups, civil society, celebrities and the figurehead president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, which is controlled by the Georgian Dream and its allies, is likely to approve the bill, which must pass two more readings before becoming law. Lawmakers ended Tuesday's session without a vote and the debate will resume on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, a government-organised rally in support of the bill was attended by tens of thousands of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At that rally, former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who founded Georgian Dream, told attendees that a "global party of war" had hijacked the EU and Nato and that it was bent on using those institutions to undermine Georgian sovereignty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as "foreign agents". Georgian critics have labelled the bill "the Russian law", comparing it to Moscow's "foreign agent" legislation, which has been used to crack down on dissent there. (Reuters)

    Israel PM warns of Rafah attack 'with or without' deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Palestinian woman stands at the entrance of a tent in an area housing displaced people in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751299_1_20240501001655.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Tuesday to launch a ground offensive on the Gaza Strip's far-southern city of Rafah "with or without" a truce deal being agreed with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hawkish premier issued the warning despite strong concerns raised by top ally Washington and hours before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to arrive in Israel on his latest Middle East crisis tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu promised "total victory" and said stopping the war "before achieving all of its goals is out of the question".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal," he told families of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza, his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu's comments came as Hamas was weighing the latest plan for a truce proposed in Cairo talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators that had raised cautious hopes for an end to the fighting after nearly seven months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian militant group said it was considering a plan for a 40-day ceasefire and the exchange of scores of hostages for larger numbers of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington has heightened pressure on all sides to reach a ceasefire - a message pushed by Blinken, who was on his seventh regional tour since the war broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As diplomacy continued, Israel kept up its bombardment that has flattened swathes of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An AFP correspondent reported air strikes on Gaza City, Khan Yunis and Rafah, while Israel said "fighter jets struck a number of terror targets in central Gaza".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinians in Rafah mourned the latest victims as children were being pulled from the rubble. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University in New York early on Tuesday, barricading the entrances and unfurling a Palestinian flag out of a window in the latest escalation of demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war that have spread to US college campuses nationwide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed protesters on Columbia's Manhattan campus locking arms in front of Hamilton Hall and carrying furniture and metal barricades to the building, one of several that was occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest on the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Posts on an Instagram page for protest organisers shortly after midnight urged people to protect the encampment and join them at Hamilton Hall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The student radio station, WKCR-FM, broadcast a play-by-play of the hall’s takeover, which occurred nearly 12 hours after Monday’s 2pm deadline for the protesters to leave an encampment of around 120 tents or face suspension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representatives for the university did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Universities across the US are grappling with how to clear out encampments as commencement ceremonies approach, with some continuing negotiations and others turning to force and ultimatums that have resulted in clashes with police. Dozens of people were arrested on Monday during protests at universities in Texas, Utah and Virginia, while Columbia said hours before the takeover of Hamilton Hall that it had started suspending students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators are sparring over the Israel-Hamas war and its mounting death toll, and the number of arrests at campuses nationwide is approaching 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up. The outcry is forcing colleges to reckon with their financial ties to Israel, as well as their support for free speech. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into anti-semitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, student activists at Columbia defied the 2pm deadline to leave the encampment. Instead, hundreds of protesters remained. A handful of counter-demonstrators waved Israeli flags, and one held a sign reading, “Where are the anti-Hamas chants?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the university didn’t call police to roust the demonstrators, school spokesperson Ben Chang said suspensions had started but could provide few details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protest organisers said they were not aware of any suspensions as of Monday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Columbia’s handling of the demonstrations also has prompted federal complaints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A class-action lawsuit on behalf of Jewish students alleges a breach of contract by Columbia, claiming the university failed to maintain a safe learning environment, despite policies and promises. It also challenges the move away from in-person classes and seeks quick court action requiring Columbia to provide security for the students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a legal group representing pro-Palestinian students is urging the US Department of Education’s civil rights office to investigate Columbia’s compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for how they have been treated. (AP)

    Indonesia volcano erupts, triggers highest alert

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mount Ruang spews ash almost 2 kilometres into the sky. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751210_1_20240430154836.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia’s Mount Ruang volcano erupted on Tuesday for a second time in two weeks, spewing ash almost 2 kilometres into the sky, closing an airport and peppering nearby villages with debris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alert level of the volcano on Sulawesi Island was again raised to the highest level by the Indonesian geological service, after sensors picked up increasing volcanic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency urged residents and climbers to stay at least 6 kilometres from the volcano’s crater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 725-metre volcano in North Sulawesi province is about 95 kilometres northeast of Sam Ratulangi International Airport in Manado, the provincial capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airport was closed on Tuesday morning due to reduced visibility and the dangers posed to aircraft engines by ash, said Ambar Suryoko, head of the regional airport authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ash, grit and rock fell from the sky in towns and cities across the region, including Manado, a city with more than 430,000 people where motorists had to switch on their headlights during daytime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was dark with rocks raining at the post from the eruption,” said Yulius Ramopolii, the head of Mount Ruang monitoring post. “The vibrations were intense and knocked out power, and volcanic earthquakes shook the glass windows and everything around us.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the eruption blocked out the sun and peppered several villages with falling debris. No casualties have been reported, Ramopolii said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 11,000 people had evacuated after the April 17 eruption when authorities warned that a major eruption might collapse part of the volcano into the sea and cause a tsunami that could endanger nearby villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fewer than 3,000 remained at temporary shelters after the government lowered its alert level to the second highest from four levels and reopened the airport after four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia’s geological agency on Tuesday warned people on Tagulandang Island, especially those who live near the coast, of the potential of hot volcanic clouds and a tsunami due to eruptions of material entering the sea or collapse of volcanic dome into the sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruang is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The country is prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” – a series of fault lines stretching from the western coasts of the Americas through Japan and Southeast Asia. (AP)

    HSBC says chief executive Noel Quinn 'to retire'

<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn will retire, the bank said on Tuesday, in a surprise departure from the business that he has overhauled in the past five years through a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it has already launched a formal process to find a successor, with Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery likely the leading internal candidate for the job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, HSBC reported a 1.8 percent drop in first-quarter profit as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia and amid inflationary pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pretax profit came in at US$12.7 billion for the quarter ended March versus US$12.9 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were better than the US$12.6 billion average of analysts' forecasts compiled by HSBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-headquartered bank also announced US$3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of US$2 billion in share purchases announced in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking during a media call, Quinn said he informed the group's chairman Mark Tucker of his decision last month, saying he wanted to have a better work-life balance after an "intense" five-year period in the top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would never have dreamed of being the CEO in the bank 37 years ago and it's a privilege. But you also have to look forward and say what's right for you personally, and I did a lot reflecting on that over Christmas, the New Year, and January," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's right for me, but also think it's right for the bank, it's a natural transition point for the bank," adding he would work hard to ensure a smooth transition for his successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tucker thanked Quinn for his leadership and for his years of work at the bank, and said he and the board fully "support and respect that decision". (Reuters)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HSBC group chairman also said the board and its nomination committee hoped to name a new chief executive in the second half of this year.

    Nato chief says 'not too late' for Ukraine to win war

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday it was "not too late" for Ukraine to win the war, agreeing with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Kyiv needs more weapons, while Russian forces advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg was in Ukraine when Russia claimed the capture of two eastern villages in 24 hours, rushing an advance in the Donetsk region before crucial US weapons reach Kyiv's exhausted forces on the front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ukraine has been outgunned for months, forced to ration its ammunition... But it's not too late for Ukraine to prevail," the Nato secretary general said at a press conference with Zelensky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said months-long delays in US military aid to Ukraine had "serious consequences on the battlefield."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said that "more support is on the way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our allies are looking into what more they can do and I expect new announcements soon. So we are working hard to meet Ukraine's urgent needs," he promised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has been dependent on Western military aid to counter Russia's larger and more powerful army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky urged faster deliveries to bolster the front line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Russian army is now trying to take advantage of the situation when we are expecting supplies from our partner," the Ukrainian leader said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is why promptness in supply literally means stabilisation of the front line," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together we must disrupt the Russian offensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking of the long-awaited aid, Zelensky said "some things have started to arrive" but declined to "go into details."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden gave final approval for the aid – blocked in Congress for months – last week, saying shipments will start "right away."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Ukraine said the situation was deteriorating for its troops in the eastern Donetsk region. (AFP)

    Dozens killed as dam bursts in flood-hit Kenya

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The resulting deluge uprooted trees, washed away several homes and sent vehicles flying. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751105_1_20240430014308.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 46 people including children died when a makeshift dam burst its banks in Kenya's Rift Valley in the early hours of Monday, a local official said, as torrential rains and floods battered the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people have been killed over the March-May wet season in Kenya as heavier than usual rainfall pounds East Africa, compounded by the El Nino weather pattern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents said the accident occurred in the dead of night when the dam burst near the town of Mai Mahiu in Nakuru county, sending torrents of water and mud gushing down a hill and engulfing everything in its path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deluge cut off a road, uprooted trees, washed away homes and sent vehicles flying, devastating the village of Kamuchiri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We heard what sounded like an earthquake and roars like a moving train," said Margaret Wangechi, a 52-year-old teacher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, said on Monday evening that there were 46 bodies at the mortuary, but warned that the number could increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dead included 20 women and 17 children, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nakuru governor Susan Kihika said 110 people were being treated in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers dug through the debris, using hoes and in some cases just their bare hands in a desperate search for survivors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We collected some of the bodies held by trees and we don't know how many are under the mud," Stephen Njihia Njoroge, a local resident involved in the emergency efforts, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disaster occurred at Old Kijabe dam, a hillside barrier formed naturally over decades after railway construction work by Kenya's former British colonial rulers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Red Cross has set up a desk at a local school to help families find lost loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the government had called for inspections of all dams and reservoirs within 24 hours in case there is a need for evacuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said on X that the authorities would arrest people engaging in "risky behaviour," including motorists attempting dangerous crossings and anyone seeking to transport "passengers across flooded rivers or storm water by unsafe canoes or boats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a crowded boat capsized at the weekend in flooded Tana River county in eastern Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kindiki said two bodies had been found and 23 people rescued, and that search and rescue efforts were ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kenyan government spokesman said on Monday that 103 people had lost their lives in floods since March, in a statement that did not mention the dam disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 28,000 households have been displaced and over 185,000 people affected, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The education ministry announced on Monday it would postpone the reopening of schools following mid-term holidays to May 6 because of the rains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weather has also wreaked havoc in neighbouring Tanzania, where at least 155 people have been killed in flooding and landslides. (AFP)

    Blinken 'hopeful' Hamas will accept Gaza deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday he was hopeful Hamas would accept an "extraordinarily generous" offer to halt Israel's Gaza offensive in return for the release of hostages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel," Blinken said in Riyadh at the World Economic Forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to decide – and they have to decide quickly," Blinken said. "I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can have a fundamental change in the dynamic" in more than half-a-year of bloodshed, Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A delegation from Hamas was due on Monday in Egypt, which with Qatar has been seeking to broker a deal that would halt the Israeli offensive and see hostages freed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also discussed the ceasefire proposal on Monday in Riyadh with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, where Hamas maintains an office and the militants' chief Ismail Haniyeh is a frequent visitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken in the talks with Fidan "urged that all efforts be brought to bear to convince Hamas to accept the immediate ceasefire proposal that is on the table," a State Department statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey recognises Israel but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a strident critic of its Gaza offensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erdogan has voiced an eagerness for a greater role in mediating the Gaza conflict after Qatar in recent weeks indicated it would take a step back. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday said that after a period of reflection about his future he had decided to continue as the country's leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said he had informed King Felipe VI of his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His decision to continue draws a line under a week in which Spanish politics was thrown into further turmoil by the prospect of facing another parliamentary vote to choose a new prime minister or even a fourth general election in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, 52, surprised both foes and allies alike when he said last Wednesday he was taking several days away from public duty to consider quitting, provoking large demonstrations from his followers in the country over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his announcement on the same day a court said it would investigate his wife, Begona Gomez, for influence peddling and business corruption, allegations he said were false and orchestrated by his conservative opponents. (Reuters)

 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday arrived in Riyadh at the start of a new trip to the Middle East aimed at pushing for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and increasing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat will also visit Jordan and Israel on his seventh visit to the region since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the Israeli assault on Gaza.

  In Saudi Arabia, Blinken was expected hold new talks with the Saudi leadership on potential normalisation of relations with Israel, a US State Department official said.

  Saudi Arabia was considering the step -- which would carry massive significance as the kingdom is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites -- before October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has sought to keep up momentum, dangling the prospect of normalisation to encourage moderation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a long-time opponent of Palestinian statehood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will also meet in Riyadh with a number of Gulf Arab and European foreign ministers who are visiting for a World Economic Forum meeting and Gulf Cooperation Council talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will discuss "day-after" plans for reconstruction of post-war Gaza, according to the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans could include funding to rebuild Gaza -- the vast majority of whose people have been displaced -- or support for installing new governance structures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived hours after US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone about ongoing talks to halt Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for the release of hostages.

 At least four people died, including a four-month-old baby, and scores were injured in the state of Oklahoma after dozens of twisters swept the US Southern Plains, while weather alerts on Sunday put more than 7 million Americans under tornado warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Sunday declared a disaster emergency for the state, freeing up more money for first responders and recovery operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Definitely the most damage since I've been governor," Stitt said in Sulphur, one of the hardest-hit communities, as he provided an update on fatalities and damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stitt began his first term as governor in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a call with the Oklahoma governor, President Joe Biden offered the full support of the federal government to help with the recovery efforts, the White House said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storm warnings for high winds, heavy rain and hail also were issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) on Sunday for more than 47 million people stretching from East Texas north through Illinois and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NWS reported 38 possible twisters hit the area and that the worst of the storms rolled through Central Oklahoma on Saturday into early Sunday morning, spreading into northwest Texas, western Missouri and Kansas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said area hospitals reported 100 injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twisters destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, including the hospital in the town of Marietta, although no injuries were reported there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20,000 customers in the state remained without power as of Sunday evening, according to officials, as emergency personnel worked to clear roads and repair power lines. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will host a meeting of state and territory leaders on Wednesday to discuss a coordinated response towards violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands protested in cities around the country at the weekend to draw attention to the deaths of 27 women so far this year allegedly caused by acts of gender-based violence in a population of 27 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese on Monday described domestic violence as a “national crisis”, and said the rallies were a call to action for all levels of Australian government to do more to prevent gender-based violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Quite clearly, we need to do more. It’s not enough to just have empathy,” Albanese told Nine Network television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact that... a woman dies every four days on average at the hand of a partner is just a national crisis,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 17 rallies held across Australia over the weekend, with an estimated 15,000 people demonstrating in the city of Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese, his Women’s Minister Katy Gallagher and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth received a hostile response when they attended a rally in the capital Canberra on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters yelled at the government leaders, “we want action” and “do your job.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said there needed to be more focus on perpetrators and prevention of violence. “We need to change the culture, we need to change attitudes, we need to change the legal system,” he told the rally. (AP)

    Ukraine warns the situation in the east has 'worsened'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's army leader admitted on Sunday that Kyiv's position on the battlefield has worsened after Russian forces captured another village in the east, pressing their advantage in manpower and ammunition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia's troops are advancing in the eastern Donetsk region as Kyiv awaits the arrival of much-needed US weapons that it hopes will stabilise the fragile front lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation at the front has worsened," Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a Facebook post on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian troops had "retreated" westwards to new defensive lines in a section of the front that runs past the city of Donetsk, controlled by pro-Russian forces since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has "a significant advantage in forces and means" and had been able to notch up advances amid "heavy fighting," Syrsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some sectors the enemy had tactical success, and in some areas our troops managed to improve the tactical position," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday claimed its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka in the Donetsk region – around 10 kilometres north of Avdiivka, which they seized in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stark assessment of the picture facing Ukrainian troops comes at the end of week of ups and downs for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States finally approved a US$61 billion package of financial aid after months of political wrangling, unlocking much-needed arms for Ukraine's stretched troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on the battlefield Russia chalked up more successes.
