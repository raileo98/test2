    <![CDATA[<img alt="Gazans hold Eid al-Adha prayers by the ruins of the Al-Rahma mosque.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's military said on Sunday it would "pause" fighting around a south Gaza route daily to facilitate aid deliveries, following months of warnings of famine in the besieged Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement of a "local, tactical pause of military activity" during daylight hours in an area of Rafah came a day after eight Israeli soldiers were killed in a blast near the far-southern city and three more troops died elsewhere, in one of the heaviest losses for the army in its war against Hamas militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations welcomed the Israeli move, although "this has yet to translate into more aid reaching people in need," said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, calling for "further concrete measures" on aid needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Gazans "urgently need food, water, sanitation, shelter, and healthcare, with many living near piles of solid waste, heightening health risks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be able to deliver aid safely throughout Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN agencies and aid groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm of dire shortages of food and other essentials in the Gaza Strip, exacerbated by overland access restrictions and the closure of the key Rafah crossing with Egypt since Israeli forces seized the Palestinian side in early May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has long defended its efforts to let aid into Gaza including via its Kerem Shalom border near Rafah, blaming militants for looting supplies and humanitarian workers for failing to distribute them to civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes will take place from 8:00 am (0500 GMT) until 7:00 pm (1600 GMT) every day until further notice along the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing to the Salah al-Din road and then northwards," a military statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A map released by the army showed the declared humanitarian route extending until Rafah's European Hospital, about 10 kilometres from Kerem Shalom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came as Muslims worldwide mark Eid al-Adha, but there is little to celebrate in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no joy. We have been robbed of it," said Malakiya Salman, a 57-year-old displaced woman, now living in a tent in Khan Younis city in the southern Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gazans, like Muslims the world over, would usually slaughter sheep for the holiday – whose Arabic name means "feast of the sacrifice" – and share the meat with the needy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents would also gift children new clothes and money in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses in Gaza's north and centre reported no fighting on Sunday morning, though there was some shelling and at least one strike in Rafah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military stressed in a statement there was "no cessation of hostilities in the southern Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the pause was already in effect and part of efforts to "increase the volumes of humanitarian aid" following discussions with the UN and other organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States, which has been pressing close ally Israel as well as Hamas to accept a ceasefire plan laid out by President Joe Biden, on Friday imposed sanctions on an extremist Israeli group for blocking and attacking Gaza-bound aid convoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the eight soldiers killed on Saturday were hit by an explosion as they were travelling in an armoured vehicle near Rafah, where troops were engaged in fierce street battles against Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the blast was "apparently from an explosive device planted in the area or from the firing of an anti-tank missile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, two soldiers were killed in fighting in northern Gaza and another succumbed to wounds inflicted in recent fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's losses brought the Israeli military's overall toll to 309 deaths since it began its its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his condolences following "this terrible loss" and said that "despite the heavy and unsettling price, we must cling to the goals of the war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas following the Palestinian group's unprecedented October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages. Of these, 116 remain in Gaza, although the army says 41 are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,337 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. (AFP)

    Ukraine peace summit says dialogue needed to end war

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Representatives from more than 90 countries had gathered for the two-day peace summit. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757698_1_20240616235730.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of countries said on Sunday that Ukraine's "territorial integrity" should be respected in any peace deal to end the war, as they said "dialogue between all parties" would be necessary for a lasting settlement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a final communique issued at the end of a major two-day diplomatic summit in Switzerland, the vast majority of countries also backed a call for the full exchange of captured soldiers and return of deported Ukrainian children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not all attendees backed the document, with India, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates among those not included in a list of supporting states displayed on screens at the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that reaching peace requires the involvement of and dialogue between all parties," the document stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "We reaffirm our commitment to ... the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognised borders."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 countries had gathered in the Swiss resort of Burgenstock for the summit, dedicated to discussing Kyiv's proposals for a route out of the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow was not invited and has rejected the summit as "absurd" and pointless.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv had worked hard to secure attendance from countries that maintain warm relations with Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final document also called for all prisoners of war to be released in a "complete exchange" and for all Ukrainian children who had been "deported and unlawfully displaced" to be returned to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv accuses Russia of abducting almost 20,000 children from parts of the east and south of the country that its forces took control of.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Working groups at the summit also addressed the issues of global food security and nuclear safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Food security must not be weaponised in any way," the declaration stated, adding that access to ports in the Black and Azov Seas was "critical" for global food supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the countries also called for Ukraine to have "full sovereign control" over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located in the south of Ukraine, the facility is Europe's largest nuclear energy site and has been controlled by Russian forces since early in the war. (AFP)

    At least 19 hajj pilgrims dead in Saudi Arabia

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 19 Jordanian and Iranian pilgrims have died while on the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, authorities from their countries said on Sunday, as temperatures soar in the kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "14 Jordanian pilgrims died and 17 others were missing" during the performance of hajj rituals, Jordan's foreign ministry said in a statement, not specifying their cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Koolivand said "five Iranian pilgrims have lost their lives so far in Mecca and Medina during the hajj this year," also not saying how they died.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hajj, one of the world's biggest religious gatherings, is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must perform it at least once.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Temperatures have pushed well past 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) during the annual pilgrimage that around 1.8 million Muslims are taking part in this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of the rituals are performed outdoors and on foot, creating challenges especially among the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia has not provided any information on fatalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the kingdom has implemented heat mitigation measures, including climate-controlled areas, distributes water, and offers advice to pilgrims on protecting themselves from the sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During last year's hajj at least 240 people – many from Indonesia – died, according to figures announced by various countries which also did not specify causes of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 10,000 heat-related illnesses were recorded last year, 10 percent of them heat stroke, a Saudi official said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Saudi study said regional temperatures were rising 0.4 C each decade, and worsening heat may be outpacing mitigation measures. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A shooter has opened fire at a water park in the US state of Michigan, wounding nine or more people including at least one child, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The local sheriff's office said it potentially had the suspect contained near the scene of the shooting in Rochester Hills, a suburb of Detroit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It appears like the individual pulled up, exited a vehicle, approached the splash pad, opened fire. Reloaded, opened fire. Reloaded. Left. So it appears very random at this point," Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County told reporters, adding he believed the shooter had "no connectivity to the victims."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said preliminary information indicated there were nine to 10 victims of varying ages, including one eight-year-old child. Several hospitals have received patients, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Glock handgun and empty magazines were recovered at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Bouchard, "we believe we have an individual who's a suspect contained nearby."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that assets including SWAT teams and armoured vehicles have been deployed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said she was "heartbroken" to learn of the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials," she said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun violence in the United States is common, and thousands of Americans are killed each year in shootings. Efforts at broad reforms to the nation's gun laws have been stymied for decades. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 250,000 people took to the streets across France on Saturday to protest the rise of the far right after their success in European polls prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call legislative elections, police said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In Paris, police estimated 75,000 people had responded to a call from unions, associations and a new left-wing political coalition formed for the parliamentary elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CGT union put the figure at 640,000 protesters at a total of 182 rallies including 250,000 in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Bayonne in the southwest to Nice in the southeast, from Vannes in the west to Reims in the east, demonstrators mobilised against the prospect of a victory for the far right in the legislative elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If that were to happen, National Rally (RN) party leader Jordan Bardella could become prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I would never see the far right come to power and now it could happen," said Florence David, 60, who took part in the Paris protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No need to vote RN to love France," was among the slogans used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The marches took place mostly in calm, apart from a few brief episodes of tension in Rennes and Nantes in western France where a few dozen hard-left activists were pushed back by the police with tear gas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Paris, street infrastructure was damaged and a bank branch was targeted by hooded protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police there were also the target of bottles thrown to which they responded with tear gas. (AFP)

    Israel army says eight soldiers killed in Gaza

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said eight soldiers were killed in Gaza on Saturday when the armoured vehicle they were in exploded, in one of the deadliest blows for the army since the war began in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Captain Wassem Mahmud, 23, and seven other soldiers "fell during operational activity in southern Gaza," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their families have been notified."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked if the soldiers died when the Namer armoured vehicle they were travelling in exploded, a military press desk officer said: "Yes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer said the explosion struck near Gaza's far-southern city of Rafah, where troops are engaged in fierce street battles with Palestinian militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's losses were among the heaviest for the military since it began its ground offensive in Gaza on October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-one soldiers were killed on January 22 when rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fire hit a tank near two buildings where they were carrying out an operation, the military said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buildings exploded as troops had planted explosives in them after the structures had been identified as "terrorist infrastructure" in the area, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's deaths take to 306 the military's losses since October 27.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,296 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Ukraine summit seeking peace plan opens in Switzerland

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling the summit the first step towards a just peace. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757607_1_20240615232721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders were joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Switzerland on Saturday for a summit on peace in his country, but with Russia staying away it is seen as the first step in a long process.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Swiss hosts have sought to temper expectations at the two-day gathering, with an agenda laying the groundwork for a path to peace – with future summits envisioned, eventually involving Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zelensky himself expressed high hopes for the outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see history being made here at the summit," he said on social media platform Telegram, as he greeted presidents and prime ministers arriving at the luxury Burgenstock resort high above Lake Lucerne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we are making the first step toward just peace based on the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law," he said on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a combative speech on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed the conference and demanded that Kyiv effectively surrender before any actual peace negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky branded Putin's demands a territorial "ultimatum" reminiscent of Nazi Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler, while Nato and the United States also immediately rejected the hardline conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conference, convening exactly 100 countries and global institutions, comes at a perilous moment for exhausted Ukrainians and outgunned soldiers, more than two years since Moscow launched its full-scale assault in February 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 50 heads of state and government figure among the attendees, including all of the G7 leaders who have been meeting in Italy – with one notable exception.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden instead sent his Vice President Kamala Harris, who announced more than US$1.5 billion in new aid for Ukraine, mainly for its energy sector and in humanitarian assistance as she arrived in a US Army helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan are attending, as is the European Union chief and the leaders of Colombia, Chile, Finland, Ghana, Kenya and Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentinian President Javier Milei and the presidents of Ecuador and Fiji were among the early arrivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's Brics allies Brazil and South Africa are meanwhile only sending an envoy, and India will be represented at the ministerial level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is absent, insisting it will not take part without Moscow's presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost a year of stalemate, Ukraine was forced to abandon dozens of frontline settlements this spring, with Russian troops holding a significant advantage in manpower and resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near Ukraine's embattled eastern front, hopes for any major breakthrough are nearly nil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to hope that it will bring some changes in the future. But, as experience shows, nothing comes of it," said Maksym, a tank commander the Donetsk region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in Kyiv, Victoria, a 36-year-old energy industry worker, said she was "exhausted" by the war and wanted to believe the summit would help end it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, she said, "I'm a realist in life, so I don't have high hopes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts have also warned against unrealistic expectations from the gathering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meaningful negotiations that could truly end the devastating war in Ukraine remain out of reach, as both Kyiv and Moscow stick to theories of victory that amount to outlasting the other," the International Crisis Group think tank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit aims to find paths towards a lasting peace for Ukraine based on international law and the United Nations Charter; a possible framework to achieve this goal; and a roadmap as to how both parties could come together in a future peace process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A plenary session involving all delegations will be held on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, three topics will be discussed in detail in working groups: nuclear safety, freedom of navigation and food security, and humanitarian aspects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second summit is envisaged. Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said on Tuesday that Kyiv hoped Russia would attend and receive a "joint plan" presented by the other attendees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at the Rand think tank, said of the Burgenstock summit: "Russia is clearly going out of its way to demonstrate its pique with it... That tells you something.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Avoiding the expansion of the pro-Ukraine coalition – they're concerned about this," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since mid-May, Russian military progress has slowed and Zelensky hopes to swing the momentum further with the back-to-back G7 and peace summits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky arrived at Burgenstock on Friday evening after the G7 summit agreed to offer a new US$50-billion loan for Ukraine, using profits from the interest on frozen Russian assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A landmark 10-year security deal signed by Zelensky and Biden on Thursday will see the United States provide Ukraine with military aid and training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, the European Union's 27 member states agreed "in principle" on beginning accession negotiations with Ukraine. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian attacks on southern Russia's Belgorod region killed six people on Friday, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia's Emergencies Ministry said four bodies had been pulled from the rubble of a multi-floor apartment building hit by Ukrainian shelling in the border town of Shebekino.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A ministry statement posted after midnight said 50 percent of the rubble from the site had been cleared. Pictures on the ministry's Telegram channel showed a crane clearing debris and the building's facade shattered, with one stairwell collapsed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a Ukrainian drone had struck a car in a village near Shebekino, killing the driver. He said a woman was killed in her home when it was struck by rocket fire in the village of Oktyabrsky, further west.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has staged frequent attacks on Belgorod and other Russian border regions in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Vladimir Putin cited attacks on Belgorod as grounds for a cross-border incursion last month into Ukraine's Kharkiv region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian military said its troops seized about a dozen settlements, while Ukrainian officials say the advance has been contained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the Ukrainian side of the border, military officials in Sumy region said a Russian air strike on Friday killed one person in the town of Shostka, about 45 km inside Ukrainian territory.

    G7 says UNRWA must work unhindered in Gaza

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 G7 leaders said the UN Palestinian refugee agency must be allowed to work unhindered in Gaza, in the draft of an end-of-summit statement seen by AFP on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We agree it is critical that UNRWA and other UN organisations and agencies' distribution networks be fully able to deliver aid to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandate effectively," the Group of Seven nations said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They called for all parties to facilitate "rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need" in Gaza, particularly women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Securing full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access in all its forms -- consistent with international humanitarian law, and through all relevant land crossing points, including the Rafah crossing, through maritime delivery routes, including through Ashdod Port -- and throughout all of Gaza remains an absolute priority," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UNRWA, which coordinates nearly all aid to Gaza, has been in crisis since January, when Israel accused about a dozen of its 13,000 Gaza employees of being involved in the October 7 attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That prompted many governments, including top donor the United States, to suspend funding to the agency, threatening its efforts to deliver aid in Gaza, although several have since resumed payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An independent review of UNRWA, led by French former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some "neutrality-related issues" but said Israel had yet to provide evidence for its main allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the draft statement, the G7 leaders repeated concern at the "unacceptable number of civilian casualties" in the Hamas-Israel war, now into its ninth month. They again endorse a truce and hostage release deal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis on Friday called for a ban on "lethal autonomous weapons", as he addressed the G7 leaders' summit in Italy on the perils of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In light of the tragedy that is armed conflict, it is urgent to reconsider the development and use of devices like the so-called 'lethal autonomous weapons' and ultimately ban their use," the pope said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis became the first pontiff to address the G7 group of industrialised nations as he called on countries and global bodies to push for stronger guardrails on AI given the boom in artificial intelligence and its applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leaders of the Group of Seven nations turned their attention to migration at the start of the second day of their summit Friday, seeking ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to AI, the gathering in a luxury resort in Italy’s southern Puglia region also discussed other major topics, such as financial support for Ukraine, the war in Gaza, climate change, as well as China’s industrial policy and economic security. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New YouGov poll puts Reform UK ahead of the Conservatives leaving the Tories in danger of a general election wipe-out in July's general election. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757480_1_20240614190619.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak warned on Friday that a vote for Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party would hand electoral victory to Labour, after a poll put the right-wing group ahead of Sunak's Conservatives for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Farage is one of Britain's most recognisable politicians best known for his decades long - and eventually successful - crusade for Britain to leave the European Union.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His Reform UK party began life as the Brexit Party in 2018, during the tortuous negotiations on how Britain would leave the bloc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage's unexpected return to frontline politics has split support among right-of-centre voters, badly damaging Sunak's hopes of winning an election he was already predicted to lose to the opposition Labour Party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That impact was shown in a YouGov poll on Thursday which put Reform UK on 19 percent, up from 17 percent previously, and the Conservative Party unchanged on 18 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour, led by Keir Starmer, topped the poll with 37 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this poll was replicated it would hand a blank cheque to Labour," Sunak said in Italy, where he is attending the G7 summit, according to remarks reported by British media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately a vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate makes it more likely that Keir Starmer is in No.10."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage said his party had made a "phenomenal" start to the campaign and was now the real opposition to Starmer's Labour. (Reuters)

    Tesla approves Musk's multi-billion dollar pay deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to restore CEO Elon Musk's record pay package. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757465_1_20240614175814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla shareholders approved CEO Elon Musk's US$56 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The favorable vote doesn’t necessarily mean that Musk will get the all-stock compensation anytime soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The package is likely to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court and Supreme Court for months as Tesla tries to overturn the Delaware judge's rejection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The electric car maker's stock remains richly valued even after several years of weakness in shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shareholders at Tesla's annual general meeting on Thursday re-approved Musk's 2018 record-setting compensation that backers said was necessary to keep the billionaire focused on the car company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Musk had raised doubts about his future with Tesla this year, writing on X, the social media platform he owns, that he wanted a 25 percent stake in the company in order to stop him from taking his artificial intelligence development projects elsewhere. The higher stake was needed to control the use of AI, he has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla's stock rose nearly three percent on Thursday ahead of the meeting after Musk posted on X that he had won shareholder approval.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even after Thursday's gains, Tesla's shares have tumbled 27 percent this year, and its market value has been more than halved to US$582 billion from its November 2021 high as Tesla faces fierce competition in China from BYD and other EV makers selling less-expensive cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla's shares received a badly needed boost after Musk said on April 23 that Tesla would release more affordable new models in 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its quarterly revenue fell for the first time since 2020, when the pandemic hampered production and deliveries. (Agencies)

    Millions gather in Mecca for Hajj pilgrimage

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Muslim worshippers pray around the Kaaba in Mecca's Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757438_1_20240614154349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 1.5 million pilgrims from around the world have amassed in and around Mecca in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage in which the faithful circle the cube-shaped Kaaba in the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of pilgrims was still growing as more from inside Saudi Arabia joined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi authorities expected the number of pilgrims to exceed two million this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which pushed the entire Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran and its proxies on the other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinians in Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip’s southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian authorities said 4,200 pilgrims from the occupied West Bank arrived in Mecca for Hajj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi authorities said 1,000 more from the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the war in Gaza also arrived to perform Hajj at the invitation of King Salman of Saudi Arabia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 1,000 invitees were already outside Gaza — mostly in Egypt — before closure of the Rafah crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hajj, one of the world's largest religious gatherings, involves a series of rituals in Mecca and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia that take several days to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the five pillars of Islam, it must be performed at least once by all Muslims who have the means to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After travelling from all parts of the globe to Islam's holiest city, the pilgrims will first perform the "tawaf" -- circling seven times around the Kaaba.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will then head towards Mina, a valley surrounded by craggy mountains several kilometres outside Mecca, where they will spend the night in air-conditioned tents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The climax will come on Saturday with day-long prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Mohammed delivered his final sermon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pilgrims in white garments have already been circling the Kaaba in large numbers for several days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some have waited for years for the chance to make the trip, with permits allocated by Saudi authorities on a quota basis for each country. (Agencies)

    G7 leaders pledge support for Ukraine

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a 10-year security agreement on Thursday that they hailed as a milestone in relations between their countries, but that alone was not enough to stop Zelenskyy from wondering how much longer he could count on America's support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy also said his country “urgently” needed additional air defence systems to protect Ukrainians and the nation's infrastructure from Russia's continued bombardment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaders signed the agreement on the sidelines of the annual Group of Seven summit, and Biden said the goal "is to strengthen Ukraine's defence and deterrence capabilities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelenskyy said at a joint news conference that the signing made for a “truly historic day,” but he also wondered about the durability of support from the United States and other allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's president said the right question to ask is “for how long the unity in the world will remain?" and how it will be influenced by the outcome of elections this year in many of those countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the first day of their meeting in southern Italy, G7 nations agreed on a deal to provide US$50 billion of loans for Ukraine backed by interest from frozen Russian assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although many details still need to be worked out, G7 members and the European Union are expected to contribute to the loan, with cash to reach Kyiv by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very historic step we're taking today," said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. "It is also a clear signal to the Russian President (Vladimir Putin), that he can't just sit this out and hope that fiscal problems in a country that backs Ukraine will one day let him win this war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  G7 leaders are also expected to discuss China and immigration in their summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pope Francis is also putting in a historic appearance at the G7 meeting, discussing artificial intelligence and holding multiple bilateral meetings including with Biden, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a historic day. We will welcome the Holy Father. It is the first time for a pontiff at a G7. I am proud it will happen under the Italian presidency," Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told reporters on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protests were staged near the summit venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators voiced support for Palestinians and accused the G7 of failing to do more in environmental protection. (AP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli helicopters struck Gaza's Rafah on Thursday, residents said, with Hamas reporting street battles in the southern city after top US diplomat Antony Blinken said a truce was still possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the war raged on, and tensions soared on Israel's northern border with more attacks by Lebanon's Hezbollah forces targeting military positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, which has traded near-daily fire with Hamas ally Hezbollah since the start of the Gaza war, said it would respond "with force".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli ground forces have been operating in Rafah since early May, despite widespread alarm over the fate of Palestinian civilians there, including in a ruling by the International Court of Justice later that month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Western areas of Rafah came under heavy fire on Thursday from the air, sea and land, residents said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said its fighters were battling Israeli troops on the streets in the city, near the besieged Gaza Strip's border with Egypt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Efforts to reach a truce stalled when Israel began ground operations in Rafah, but US President Joe Biden in late May launched a new effort to secure a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday the UN Security Council adopted a US-drafted resolution supporting the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken, in Doha on Wednesday to promote Biden's ceasefire roadmap, said Washington would work with regional partners to "close the deal".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said the group sought "a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal" of Israeli troops from Gaza, demands repeatedly rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan includes a six-week ceasefire, a hostage-prisoner exchange and Gaza reconstruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would be the first truce since a week-long November pause in fighting saw hostages freed and Palestinians released from Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said Israel was behind the plan, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government has far-right members strongly opposed to the deal, has not publicly endorsed it. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and New Zealand on Thursday signed agreements on trade and climate change during Premier Li Qiang's visit to the country, the highest level Chinese visit in seven years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li also expressed the hope that New Zealand can support Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership when he met Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on the first day of his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the talks, the Premier was greeted on the lawns of Government House in the capital Wellington by Luxon and participated in a traditional indigenous Maori welcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the meeting, Li said that the two agreed that it is important to expand cooperation on trade and investment and that China is ready to be part of New Zealand's efforts to double its value of exports in the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Premier said Beijing will also extend visa-free travel to New Zealanders, while New Zealand will support Chinese language teaching and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We agreed that it is important to promote the sustained sound and steady development of China and New Zealand relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to view and handle bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective to lay a solid political foundation of our cooperation in all fields.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said he expressed the hope that New Zealand could support the SAR in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade agreement. Hong Kong officially requested to join RCEP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luxon for his part said they discussed the two country's significant economic relationship, with two-way trade in goods worth nearly 22.4 billion US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and New Zealand have different political systems and as with all of our long standing relationships, it is natural that we will raise our differences with China consistently and predictably," Luxon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li will later visit Australia this weekend and then travel to Malaysia.

    Russian war ships in Cuba on 'routine visit'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Russian navy frigate and a nuclear-powered submarine churned into Havana harbour on Wednesday, a stopover the US and Cuba said posed no threat but was seen as a Russian show of force.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cuba - a long-time ally of Russia - saluted the ships' arrival with cannon fire, while Russian diplomats waved Russian flags and took selfies as the vessels passed the harbour's historic fortresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Admiral Gorshkov frigate, and later the nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, half submerged with its crew on deck, were accompanied by a tugboat and fuel ship that had arrived earlier in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four Russian vessels sailed to Cuba after conducting "high-precision missile weapons" training in the Atlantic Ocean, according to Russia's defence ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The submarine and frigate carry Zircon hypersonic missiles, Kalibr cruise missiles and Onyx anti-ship missiles, the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cuba said last week that the visit was standard practice by naval vessels from countries friendly to Havana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cuban foreign ministry said the fleet carried no nuclear weapons, something echoed by US officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US said it had been monitoring the Russian vessels as they skirted the nearby Florida coast, but said they posed no threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday such naval exercises were routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen this kind of thing before and we expect to see this kind of thing again, and I'm not going to read into it any particular motives," Sullivan said. (Reuters)

    US Congress holds AG in contempt over Biden tapes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Merrick Garland is the third US attorney-general to be held in contempt of Congress. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757197_1_20240613052411.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over audio recordings of a special counsel interview with Democratic President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure passed 216-207 on a party-line basis with one Republican joining Democrats in voting no.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice has already turned over a transcript of the interview, which set off a political firestorm in February when Special Counsel Robert Hur released a report describing Biden, 81, as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has asserted that the recordings are covered by executive privilege, and a vote by the House to hold Garland in contempt would put the Justice Department in the awkward position of having to decide whether to prosecute its own leader. It is not required to take up the charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Garland is the third attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress, following Democratic President Barack Obama's attorney general Eric Holder and Republican President Donald Trump's Bill Barr. The Justice Department did not pursue charges in either case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Transcripts alone are not sufficient evidence of the state of the president's memory," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said as debate opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representative Jerrold Nadler, the senior Democrat on the panel, countered that Republicans were on a "single-minded quest to follow every right-wing conspiracy theory in the vain hope that it might lead to some evidence of wrongdoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hur, who had investigated Biden after classified documents dating to his time as vice president from 2009-2017 were found improperly stored in his home and office, declined to prosecute the president, saying it was both because he had cooperated with the probe and because he would present a sympathetic face to a jury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's rival in the November 5 election, Trump, has been criminally charged for mishandling classified documents after his 2017-2021 term in the White House, though unlike Biden, Trump refused requests to return the documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congressional Democrats have alleged that Republicans want the audio to use in campaign ads for Trump. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) will join a unity government with the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA), it said on Wednesday, giving a strong indication of who will govern the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ANC, which lost its majority in a May 29 election but remains the largest party, has been talking to a broad spectrum of political parties to try to set up a government of national unity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final composition of the government has not yet been announced, but the comments by IFP leader Velenkosini Hlabisa gave the most precise picture of how negotiations are shaping up ahead of the newly elected parliament's first sitting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many ANC supporters strongly oppose a coalition with the pro-business DA, which is the largest opposition party but has struggled to shed its image as a defender of white privilege.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have speculated that including the IFP, a conservative party with an ethnic Zulu base, could help temper those concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will participate in the government of national unity for the sake of our country and for the sake of our people, who want life to continue with a stable government that will address their challenges," Hlabisa told reporters at a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spokespersons for the ANC and the DA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parties have been rushing to reach agreement before Friday, when the National Assembly will meet to elect its speaker, deputy speaker and the country's president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Cyril Ramaphosa is highly likely to be reelected since the ANC has the highest number of seats, but key positions such as speaker of parliament and deputy president are the subject of behind-the-scenes negotiations. (Reuters)

    Macron urges centre to unite; Republicans ditch leader

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday urged rival parties to join his electoral alliance against Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, while the conservative Republicans ditched their party chief for seeking a far-right pact.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fast-moving political developments come after Macron's shock decision to call a snap parliamentary election in a few weeks' time. The vote could hand real power to Le Pen's party after years on the sidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what amounted to a campaign speech, Macron on Wednesday defended his decision to call the snap vote, and urged parties on both sides of the political centre to join him in the battle against the hard right in the June 30 and July 7 elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron, who ruled out quitting if his ruling alliance loses, called on "our compatriots and political leaders who do not recognise themselves in the extremist fever" to "build a new project ... a coalition to govern."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of the political chaos that Macron's decision has unleashed, the Republicans party leadership on Wednesday decided to kick out their party chief Eric Ciotti after he appealed for an electoral alliance between his party's candidates and the RN.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron described such an accord as a "deal with the devil". It would have ended the decades-long mainstream political consensus to block the far-right from power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on X, Ciotti said the Republicans meeting had not followed protocol: "I am and remain the president of our political party, elected by the members!" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron called the election on Sunday after the anti-immigration, eurosceptic RN came out on top in a vote for the European Parliament. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire that broke out in a building housing workers in the city of Mangaf in southern Kuwait early on Wednesday has killed at least 41 people, the country's deputy prime minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Saud Al-Sabah said during a visit to the site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The deputy PM accused real estate owners of violations and greed, saying those factors contributed towards the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, the greed of real estate owners is what leads to these matters," said Sheikh Fahad, who also runs the interior and defense ministries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire was reported to authorities at 6am local time, Major General Eid Rashed Hamad said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The building in which the fire occurred was used to house workers, and there was a large number of workers there. Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire," another senior police commander told state TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always alert and warn against" cramming too many workers into housing accommodation, he said, without providing details on the workers' type of employment or place of origin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire was contained and authorities were investigating its cause, officials said. (Reuters)

    Hamas accepts UN-backed truce, wants more talks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas accepts a UN resolution backing a plan to end the war with Israel in Gaza and is ready to negotiate details, a senior official of the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Qatari and Egyptian mediators said they had received a formal reply from Hamas to the UN-backed truce proposal, and Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad expressed "readiness to positively" reach a deal to end the war in Gaza in a joint statement on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However both Israel and Hamas have suggested the plan meets their clashing goals, raising doubts over whether any genuine headway towards a deal can be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hamas response reaffirmed the group's stance any agreement must end the Zionist aggression on our people, get the Israeli forces out, reconstruct Gaza and achieve a serious prisoners swap deal," a Hamas official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discussions also touching on post-war plans for Gaza will continue over the next couple of days, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Tel Aviv after talks with Israeli leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken met Israeli officials on Tuesday in a push to end the eight-month-old Israeli air and ground war against Hamas that has devastated Gaza, a day after President Joe Biden's proposal for a truce was approved by the UN Security Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian residents said Israeli forces operating in the southern city of Rafah blew up a cluster of homes on Tuesday and and an Israeli air strike in a main street in Gaza City killed four people, medics said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's proposal envisages a ceasefire and phased release of hostages in exchange for Palestinians jailed in Israel, ultimately leading to a permanent end to the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri, who is based outside Gaza, said it accepted the ceasefire resolution and was ready to negotiate over the specifics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This required a formula stipulating the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a swap of hostages held in Gaza for Palestinians jailed in Israel, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US administration is facing a real test to carry out its commitments in compelling the occupation to immediately end the war in an implementation of the UN Security Council resolution," Abu Zuhri said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said earlier the Hamas statement was "a hopeful sign" but definitive word was still needed from the Hamas leadership inside Israeli-besieged Gaza. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iceland has issued a new licence to its sole remaining whaling company, enabling it to continue hunting this season, the government said on Tuesday, drawing a sharp response from campaigners seeking to protect the animals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hvalur hf will be permitted to hunt 99 fin whales in the Greenland and West Iceland region and another 29 in the East Iceland and Faroe Islands region this year, the fisheries ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whaling in Iceland has sparked protests for years from animal welfare campaigners and Hollywood celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The decision is based on a precautionary approach and reflects the government's increased emphasis on the sustainable use of resources," the ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The whaling season in Iceland lasts from mid-June to late September, with the majority of the whale meat sold to Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's ridiculous that in 2024 we're talking about target lists for the second-largest animal on Earth, for products that nobody needs," International Fund for Animal Welfare director Patrick Ramage said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Icelandic government temporarily suspended hunting for two months after the country's Food and Veterinary Authority reported that the whales' killing time exceeded the limit set by local animal welfare laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only Iceland, Norway and Japan have conducted commercial whaling in recent years, according to the International Whaling Commission's catch list. Despite an international moratorium implemented in 1986 to protect the species from extinction, Norway resumed commercial whaling in 1993 and Iceland in 2006.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan withdrew from the international body in 2019 and resumed commercial whaling in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The moratorium allows indigenous peoples in certain parts of the world, like Greenland and Alaska, to hunt whales as whale products play a vital role in their nutritional and cultural life. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire broke out at the Palace of Versailles on Tuesday, forcing the evacuation of visitors from one of France's busiest tourist sites before it was brought under control, a spokesperson said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Palace, built in the 17th century for King Louis XIV, was the main royal residence until the French Revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy in 1789.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firefighters came. There is no more smoke, no more flames and there is no damage to the collection," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire broke out in an area of roofing where renovation works were being done, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than seven million people visit the palace each year. Later this summer it will host the Olympic Games' equestrian events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, a fire consumed the roof of the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. The blaze engulfed the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Around the world, TV viewers watched with horror as the medieval building burned. (Reuters)

    Hunter Biden found guilty in gun case

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury on Tuesday of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 12-member jury in Wilmington, Delaware, federal court found him guilty on all three counts against him, making Hunter Biden the first child of a sitting US president to be convicted of a crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hunter Biden, 54, lightly nodded his head after the verdict was read but otherwise showed little reaction. He then patted his lawyer Abbe Lowell on the back and hugged another member of his legal team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge set no date for sentencing, but added the timeline is usually within 120 days. That would place it no later than a month before the November 5 US presidential election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing guidelines for the gun charges are 15 to 21 months, but legal experts say defendants in similar cases often get shorter sentences and are less likely to be incarcerated if they abide by the terms of their pretrial release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Donald Trump, the first former US president to be found guilty of a felony and the Republican challenger to Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal, accuses Democrats of pursuing that case and three other criminal prosecutions to prevent him from regaining power in his rematch with Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Congressional Democrats have pointed to cases including the Hunter Biden prosecution as evidence that Joe Biden is not using the justice system for political or personal ends, having said last week he would not pardon his son if convicted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hunter Biden case was brought by US Department of Justice Special Counsel David Weiss, a Trump appointee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weiss has also charged Hunter Biden with three felony and six misdemeanour tax offences in California, alleging he failed to pay US$1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019 while spending millions on drugs, escorts, exotic cars and other high-ticket items.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial is scheduled for September 5 in Los Angeles. (Reuters)

    UN Security Council adopts Gaza ceasefire resolution

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN Security Council on Monday overwhelmingly approved its first resolution endorsing a cease-fire plan aimed at ending the eight-month war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US-sponsored resolution welcomed a cease-fire proposal announced by President Joe Biden that the United States said Israel had accepted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It called on the militant Palestinian group Hamas to accept the three-phase plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The resolution — which was approved with 14 of the 15 Security Council members voting in favour and Russia abstaining — called on Israel and Hamas “to fully implement its terms without delay and without condition.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Whether Israel and Hamas agree to go forward with the plan remains in question, but the resolution’s strong support in the UN’s most powerful body puts added pressure on both parties to approve the proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Israel on Monday, where he urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the plan for postwar Gaza as he pushed for more international pressure on Hamas to agree to the cease-fire proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has been sceptical of the deal, saying that Israel was still committed to destroying Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas said it welcomed the adoption of the resolution and was ready to work with mediators in indirect negotiations with Israel to implement it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement was among the strongest from Hamas to date, but it stressed the group would continue its struggle against Israeli occupation and work on setting up a “fully sovereign” Palestinian state. (AP)

    Frost discovered on top of giant Mars volcanoes

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Early morning frost has been detected on the peaks of massive volcanoes on Mars, an unexpected discovery about the dispersal of water on Mars that could one day prove essential for human exploration, scientists said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The early morning frost was spotted in images taken by the European Space Agency's Trace Gas Orbiter, according to a study published in the journal Nature Geoscience on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The immense volcanoes are in the Tharsis plateau, an elevated region nearly 5,000 kilometres wide near the Martian equator.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The volcanoes have been extinct for millions of years. Among them is the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is almost three times taller than Mount Everest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The discovery came by chance – no one expected to find frost in this region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We thought it was impossible for frost to form around Mars's equator," lead study author Adomas Valantinas said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plenty of sunshine and a thin atmosphere mean the temperature is relatively warm up there, "unlike what we see on Earth, where you might expect to see frosty peaks," the researcher at Brown University in the United States said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also little water in the atmosphere near the Martian equator, making condensation less likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other space probes have observed frost but in wetter regions – notably the northern plains," study co-author Frederic Schmidt of France's Paris-Saclay University said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trace Gas Orbiter, which has been orbiting Mars since 2018, was able to take images when the first rays of the Sun crossed over the tops of the volcanoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We saw a shiny, blue deposit there, a particular texture that we only see in the early morning and during the cold seasons," Schmidt said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The layer of the ice is only the thickness of a hair – and it does not last long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there is about 150,000 tonnes of water – equivalent to 60 Olympic swimming pools – in the daily frost at the summits of volcanoes Olympus Mons, Arsia Mons, Ascraeus Mons and Ceraunius Tholus, the ESA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers suggested the frost is caused by a micro-climate that forms inside the calderas of the huge volcanoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As wind whips up the sides of the volcanoes, it brings "relatively moist air from near the surface up to higher altitudes, where it condenses and settles as frost," study co-author Nicolas Thomas explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We actually see this happening on Earth and other parts of Mars," said Thomas, who works on the Trace Gas Orbiter's imaging system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modelling how these frosts form "could allow scientists to reveal more of Mars's remaining secrets, including where water exists and how it moves between reservoirs," the ESA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This may prove crucial for planned missions that could see humans set foot on Martian soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We could recover water from the frost for human consumption, or launch rockets from Mars by separating the oxygen and hydrogen molecules," Schmidt said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mapping the location of water on Mars – which only exists as ice or vapour – could also be key in the search for signs of extra-terrestrial life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liquid water is considered one of the essential ingredients for life on other planets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A military plane carrying Malawi's vice president and nine others went missing on Monday and a search was underway, the president's office said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The plane carrying 51-year-old Vice President Saulos Chilima left the capital, Lilongwe, but failed to make its scheduled landing at Mzuzu International Airport about 370 kilometres to the north around 45 minutes later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aviation authorities lost contact with the plane when it “went off radar,” the statement from Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera's office said. Chakwera ordered a search operation and cancelled a trip to the Bahamas, his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All efforts to make contact with the aircraft since it went off radar have failed thus far," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chakwera was informed of the missing plane by General Valentino Phiri, the head of the Malawian armed forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president had ordered national and local authorities to “conduct an immediate search and rescue operation to locate the whereabouts of the aircraft,” his office said. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Local volunteers say the paramilitary RSF attacked the hospital on Saturday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756849_1_20240610233350.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The main hospital in Sudan's al-Fashir city has been attacked and put out of service, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which supports the facility, said on Sunday, while local volunteers blamed the incident on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city, in the Darfur region of northwestern Sudan, is home to more than 1.8 million residents and displaced people, and is the latest front in a war between the Sudanese army and the RSF which began in April 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF, which has taken over the capital Khartoum and most of western Sudan, is also seeking to advance further within the centre, as United Nations agencies say the people of Sudan are at "imminent risk of famine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 130,000 people have fled their homes in al-Fashir as a result of the fighting in April and May, the United Nations has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The RSF did not respond to a request for comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MSF did not say who had attacked the hospital, the only hospital in al-Fashir capable of handling what it describes as daily mass casualty events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From May 10 to June 6, some 1,315 wounded arrived at the facility and 208 people have died there, but many people are not able to reach the hospital due to the fighting, MSF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel-Olivier Lacharite, head of MSF emergency operations, said the hospital had previously started evacuating patients after being impacted by fighting three times since May 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The al-Fashir Emergency Response Room, a volunteer group, said on Sunday that RSF fighters raided the hospital on Saturday, killing and injuring several people and looting medicine and an ambulance and forcing the hospital to shut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An eyewitness said he saw people evacuating the hospital, and other eyewitnesses said the RSF had launched missiles at the hospital and its vicinity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate attack on Saturday on the Abu Shouk camp to the north of the city impacted another medical centre, injured more than 30, and killed at least two, the camp committee and a volunteer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A report last week from The Yale Humanitarian Research Lab said some 40 settlements outside the city have been struck with arson attacks since March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local residents have blamed the RSF for the attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leaving the city has proven dangerous, as residents say those fleeing have been attacked and even killed on the main RSF-controlled road out of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most of those leaving have taken routes either south to Zamzam camp, or west to the Tawila and Jebel Mara areas, which are controlled by armed groups, including the faction of the Sudan Liberation Army headed by Abdelwahid Mohamed Nour, an aid worker and residents said. (Reuters)

    Blinken arrives in Cairo at start of Mideast tour

    <![CDATA[<img alt="This is Antony Blinken's eighth visit to the region since war broke out in early October. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756841_1_20240610211844.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Egypt on Monday at the start of another regional tour to push for a much awaited Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken is expected to hold closed-door talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo before heading to Jerusalem later on Monday to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, the first Arab state to recognise Israel and sign a peace treaty with it in 1979, has long mediated between Israeli and Palestinian officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sisi and Blinken are expected to discuss plans to reopen the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, a key conduit for aid into the besieged territory which has been closed for a month since Israeli troops seized its Palestinian side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat's eighth visit to the region since war broke out in early October is intended to gather support for a proposal announced on May 31 by US President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key mediators the US, Egypt and Qatar have been engaged in months of negotiations for a ceasefire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A one-week truce in November – the only one so far in the Israel-Hamas war – saw some 100 hostages freed, most of them in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the latest proposal, Israel would withdraw from Gaza population centres and Hamas would free hostages as fighting halts for an initial six weeks, with the truce extended as negotiators seek a permanent end to hostilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has not formally responded to the plan, which Biden had described as Israeli, while fears have mounted that domestic Israeli politics could hamper negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While in Israel, Blinken is also expected to meet Benny Gantz, a centrist politician who on Sunday resigned from the war cabinet over Netanyahu's handling of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will then head to Jordan and Qatar for further talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war broke out after the October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 37,124 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Monday warned of further responses if the South kept up its "psychological warfare".
 <br>
  <br/>
  In recent weeks, North Korea has sent hundreds of balloons into the South, carrying trash like cigarette butts and toilet paper, in what it calls retaliation for balloons laden with anti-Pyongyang propaganda floated northwards by activists in the South, which Seoul legally cannot stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean government this month fully suspended a 2018 tension-reducing military deal and restarted loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border in response to Pyongyang's balloons, infuriating the North which warned Seoul was creating "a new crisis".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim's influential sister and key government spokeswoman Kim Yo-jong said in a statement released Monday that South Korea would "suffer a bitter embarrassment of picking up waste paper without rest and it will be its daily work".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, she slammed the activists' leaflets as "psychological warfare" and warned that unless Seoul stopped them and called off the loudspeaker broadcasts, the North would hit back. (AFP)

    Far-right make gains in European elections

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right parties made big strides in elections for the European Parliament, results that rattled the continent's traditional powers and made French President Emanuel Macron call snap legislative elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Millions voted for candidates to serve five-year terms in a new European Parliament, the legislative branch of the 27-member trade bloc made up of 720 seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron’s party suffered a heavy defeat from the far-right National Rally party, while in Germany support for Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats sank to a projected 14 percent, behind the extreme-right Alternative for Germany, which surged into second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saw her position strengthened by her arch-conservative Brothers of Italy group winning the most votes, exit polls showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the gains on the right, exit polls showed a coalition of centre-left and centre-right would remain the majority in parliament, albeit smaller than before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exit poll projected that pro-European centre-right, centre-left, liberal and Green parties would retain a majority of 456 seats, but one which is significantly slimmed down compared to their 488 in the outgoing chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rightwards shift inside the European Parliament may make it tougher to pass new legislation that might be needed to respond to security challenges, the impact of climate change or industrial competition from China and the United States. (Agencies)

    Trump goes on attack in first post-conviction rally

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump speaks to supporters in Las Vegas. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756779_1_20240610101619.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday that he would seek to end taxation of income from tips, a direct appeal to service workers in the swing state of Nevada, which polls suggest is leaning his way ahead of the November 5 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump also once again talked up his supporters convicted for their roles in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, calling them "warriors" and suggesting a possible counter-investigation into the event if he were re-elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pledge on tips, revealed at a sweltering outdoor rally in Las Vegas where temperatures reached 37 degrees Celsius, adds one more detail to a Trump tax plan that has included vague pledges of tax relief to middle-income workers and small businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So this is the first time I've said this, and for those hotel workers and people that get tips you're going to be very happy because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips people (are) making," Trump told a crowd of several thousand people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said he would "do that right away, first thing in office," and noted in prepared remarks that he would seek legislation in Congress to make the change. "You do a great job of service, you take care of people and I think it's going to be something that really is deserved."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has previously pledged to make permanent the Republican-passed individual tax cuts that he signed into law in 2017 but which expire at the end of 2025. Tax experts estimate that doing so would raise US deficits by some US$4 trillion over a decade compared to current forecasts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As current law requires, tipped employees must report their tips as income. Eliminating this would add further to deficits without new revenues elsewhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's Democratic opponent, President Joe Biden, has pledged to maintain Trump's tax cuts for households earning under US$400,000 a year, but wants to substantially raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and on large corporations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Las Vegas speech was Trump's first large-scale rally since a New York jury found him guilty on May 30 of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election, making him the first former US president convicted of a crime. (Reuters)

    Macron shocks France by calling snap elections

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Macron shocks France by calling snap elections" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756761_1_20240610051409.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron set off a political earthquake on Sunday when he called shock legislative elections for later this month after he was trounced in the European Union vote by Marine Le Pen's far-right party.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Macron's surprise decision represents a major roll of the dice on his political future, three years before his presidency ends. If Le Pen's National Rally (RN) party wins a parliamentary majority, Macron would be left without a say in domestic affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron said the EU results were grim for his government, and one he could not pretend to ignore. In an address to the nation, less than two months before Paris hosts the Olympics, he said lower house elections would be called for June 30, with a second-round vote on July 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is an essential time for clarification," Macron said. "I have heard your message, your concerns and I will not leave them unanswered ... France needs a clear majority to act in serenity and harmony."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Led by telegenic 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, the RN won about 32 percent of the vote in Sunday's vote, more than double the Macron ticket's 15 percent, according to the first exit polls. The Socialists came within a whisker of Macron, with 14 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen, the frontrunner for the 2027 election in which Macron is unable to stand, welcomed the president's decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are ready to take over power if the French give us their trust in the upcoming national elections," she said at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron's advisers said the president made his decision after this week's 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, when he met people out and about who said they were tired of endless political infighting in parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Le Pen and Bardella sought to frame the EU election as a mid-term referendum on Macron's mandate, tapping into discontent with immigration, crime and a two-year inflation crisis. (Reuters)

    Centrist Benny Gantz quits Israel's war Cabinet

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Benny Gantz , a centrist member of Israel’s three-man war Cabinet, announced his resignation on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move does not immediately pose a threat to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who still controls a majority coalition in parliament. But the Israeli leader becomes more heavily reliant on his far-right allies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz said that Netanyahu is making “total victory impossible” and that the government needs to put the return of the hostages seized October 7 by Hamas "above political survival.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The popular former military chief joined Netanyahu’s government shortly after the Hamas attack in a show of unity. His presence also boosted Israel’s credibility with its international partners. Gantz has good working relations with US officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gantz had previously said he would leave the government by June 8 if Netanyahu did not formulate a new plan for post-war Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He scrapped a planned news conference on Saturday night after four Israeli hostages were dramatically rescued from Gaza earlier in the day in Israel’s largest such operation since the eight-month war began.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 274 Palestinians, including children, were killed in the assault, Gaza health officials said. (Reuters)

    Biden visits WWI cemetery in France in rebuke to Trump

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756752_1_20240610001215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden travelled to a World War I cemetery in France on Sunday in a visit seen as a jab at his predecessor Donald Trump who in 2018 skipped the visit, reportedly calling American war dead "losers."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden, an 81-year-old Democrat, is set to face Trump, a 77-year-old Republican, later this year in a presidential election that commentators predict will subject US democracy to a severe test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the last day of his five-day tour, Biden visited the sprawling Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial near the village of Belleau in northern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cemetery contains the graves of 2,289 war dead, most of whom fought in the vicinity and in the Marne Valley in 1918.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the visit, Biden saluted military officers standing beside a floral wreath at the bottom of the steps of a cemetery chapel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He then approached the wreath, touched it, stood silently for a few moments and made the sign of the cross.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then-president Trump cancelled his visit to the site in 2018, officially due to poor weather that made helicopter travel risky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Atlantic magazine, citing sources, said Trump refused to visit the cemetery because he did not think it was important and because he was also concerned about his hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers," the magazine quoted Trump as telling his staff members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate conversation, Trump called the marines who perished at Belleau Wood "suckers," the Atlantic reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The billionaire has denied making those remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has repeatedly needled Trump over the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He said they're 'losers' and 'suckers'," Biden said at a recent fundraiser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who in the hell does he think he is? This guy does not deserve to be president," he said in comments released by the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden preferred not to discuss the controversy on Sunday, however.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked by reporters what message he wanted to send to voters, Biden replied: "Any other question?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been in France since Wednesday and took part in this week's commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those landings in northern France, involving US, British, Canadian and other foreign troops, changed the course of World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Biden on a state visit overshadowed by Ukraine's fight against Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he had travelled to France many times but "this has been the most remarkable trip that I've ever made." (AFP)

    Modi sworn in for an historic third term as India's PM

    <![CDATA[<img alt="BJP leader Narendra Modi takes the oath of office for a third time. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756748_1_20240609221641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Narendra Modi was sworn in as India's prime minister on Sunday for a record-equalling third term, but as a restive coalition's head after a shock poll setback that will test his ability to ensure policy certainty in the world's most populous nation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Droupadi Murmu administered the oath of office to Modi at a grand ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president's palace in New Delhi, attended by thousands of dignitaries, including the leaders of seven regional countries, Bollywood stars and industrialists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, who started as a publicist of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is only the second person after independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to serve a third straight term as prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, 73, secured the third term in elections that concluded on June 1 with the support of 14 regional parties in his BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), unlike in the previous two terms when his party won an outright majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outcome is seen as a big setback to the popular leader as surveys and exit polls had predicted BJP would secure even more seats than in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi delivered world beating growth and lifted India's global standing but appeared to have missed a step at home as a lack of enough jobs, high prices, low incomes and religious faultlines pushed voters to rein him in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Modi was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, BJP enjoyed strong majorities, allowing him to govern decisively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's new term as prime minister, therefore, is likely to be fraught with challenges on building consensus on contentious political and policy issues in the face of different interests of regional parties and a stronger opposition, analysts say.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some analysts worry that the fiscal balance in the world's fastest growing economy could also come under pressure due to demands for higher development funds for states ruled by the NDA's regional partners and a possible push by BJP to spend more on welfare to woo back voters it lost in this year's election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, whose election campaign was marked by religious rhetoric and criticism of the opposition for allegedly favouring India's 200 million minority Muslims, has adopted a more conciliatory tone since the shock result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have won the majority ... but to run the country it is unanimity that is crucial ... we will strive for unanimity," he said on Friday after the NDA formally named him coalition head. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's Guardian Council, which oversees elections and legislation, has approved six candidates to run for president in snap elections to be held later this month after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, Iran's State TV reported on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the list are Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Iran's hardline parliament speaker and former Revolutionary Guards commander, Saeed Jalili, a conservative, who was former chief nuclear negotiator and ran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office for four years and Tehran's conservative mayor Alireza Zakani, according to State TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The list, announced on state TV by the Election Office spokesperson, also includes Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist lawmaker, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a hardliner and a former interior minister, and Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi a conservative politician.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the announcement of the final list of candidates, their electoral activities start officially," state TV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election is due to take place on June 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Council had disqualified hardline former president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and former parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, a prominent conservative, state media said. (Reuters)

 The body of British TV presenter and healthy living advocate Michael Mosley has been found on the Greek island of Symi, a deputy mayor on the island said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mosley had been missing for several days. Earlier, a police spokeswoman said that the body of a person believed to be Mosley had been found in the area of Agia Marina on the island, but identification was at that time still pending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mosley, 67, who endorsed fasting and offered tips on sleep and diet, was last seen on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had disappeared after setting out on a stroll in searing temperatures along a rocky coastal path from Agios Nikolaos beach to the village of Pedi. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Voters in 21 EU countries including France and Germany will conclude a four-day election for the European Parliament on Sunday, which is expected to shift the assembly to the right and boost the numbers of eurosceptic nationalists.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The election will shape how the European Union, a bloc of 450 million citizens, confronts challenges including a hostile Russia, increased industrial rivalry, climate change and immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election began on Thursday in the Netherlands and in other countries on Friday and Saturday, but the bulk of EU votes will be cast on Sunday, with France, Germany, Poland and Spain opening the polls and Italy holding a second day of voting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opinion polls predict the pro-European liberals and Greens will lose seats, reducing the majority of the centre-right and centre-left and complicating efforts to push through new EU laws or increase European integration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many voters have been hit by the cost of living crisis, have concerns about migration and the cost of the green transition and are disturbed by rising geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hard and far-right parties have seized on this disquiet and offered the electorate an alternative to the mainstream.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Greens, facing a backlash from hard-pressed households, farmers and industry over costly EU policies limiting CO2 emissions, look set to be among the big losers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasts for the liberal group Renew Europe are also grim, given the expectation that Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National will trounce French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Renaissance in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Netherlands, exit polls from Thursday already showed nationalist Geert Wilders' anti-immigration party was set to win seven of the 29 Dutch seats in the EU assembly, from zero in 2019, following up on his large win in last year's national election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Belgium, voters will also get to elect federal and regional chambers and are forecast to back the far-right Flemish separatist party Vlaams Belang in record numbers, although it could still be kept from office by other parties. (Reuters)

    North Korea sends more trash-filled balloons south

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756692_1_20240609094636.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea has resumed sending balloons carrying trash over the border to South Korea, officials and news reports said on Sunday, a week after it vowed to continue if anti-North Korea leaflets are flown from the South.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of balloons with trash attached have been found in Seoul and in areas near the border overnight and early on Sunday, after the South Korean military said late on Saturday the North was again launching them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's military said on Sunday it takes the balloons "very seriously" and was on alert to take action in response as necessary. It did not elaborate what actions it would take.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea has warned it would take "unendurable" measures against the North for sending the trash balloons, which could include blaring propaganda broadcasts from huge loudspeakers set up at the border directed at the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Korean government has said the balloons were sent in retaliation to anti-North leaflets flown by South Korean activists as part of a propaganda campaign and launched hundreds of them starting late in May carrying trash and manure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On June 2, it said it would temporarily halt sending the balloons because 15 tons of trash it sent was probably enough to get the message across how "unpleasant" it was. However, it vowed to resume if leaflets are again flown from the South by sending hundred times the amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A group of South Korean activists defied the warning and have since flown more balloons to the North with leaflets criticising its leader Kim Jong Un together with USB sticks containing K-pop videos and dramas, and US dollar notes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea has shown some of the angriest reaction towards the leaflet campaign and the loudspeaker broadcasts, in some cases firing weapons at the balloons and the speakers in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts have said the reaction was an indication Pyongyang considers the propaganda as a serious threat to controlling its public. (Reuters)

    Bodies of 11 migrants found off coast of Libya

<div class="itemFullText">
 An aid group said on Saturday it recovered the bodies of 11 migrants off the Libyan coast and transferred them to an Italian coast guard ship off Lampedusa island, where thousands are trying to reach from North Africa.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The aid group, Doctors Without Borders, said its Geo Barents rescue ship had recovered the bodies following a search operation that lasted more than nine hours, after being alerted by German humanitarian organisation Sea-Watch, which also rescues migrants at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German group said it was unclear whether the migrants were victims of a previous shipwreck, adding they had tried to contact Libya’s coast guard to recover the bodies but received no reply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Saturday’s mission, the Sea-Watch crew also discovered another body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As we cannot determine the reason behind this tragedy, we know that people will continue to take dangerous routes in a desperate attempt to reach safety, and Europe must find safe and legal pathways for them,” Doctors Without Borders, also known as MSF, wrote in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MSF vessel was ordered to transport the other 165 people onboard, who were rescued during its Mediterranean operations, to the northern port of Genoa. The group complained that the decision would significantly delay assistance to migrants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of migrants leaving from North African countries try to reach Europe using Libya as a departing point, as they brave a dangerous journey across the Mediterranean to escape war and poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central Mediterranean route remains the world’s most dangerous crossing. In 2023, more than 3,000 people went missing on this route, according to the International Organisation for Migration. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers continued searching for British TV presenter Michael Mosley on the mountainous Greek island of Symi on Saturday, the third day of a wide operation launched after he was reported missing by his wife.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 67-year-old doctor and healthy living advocate, who has endorsed fasting and offered tips on sleep and diet, was last seen at 1:30 pm (1030 GMT) on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He disappeared after he set out on a stroll in searing temperatures along a rocky coastal path from Agios Nikolaos beach to the village of Pedi. Mosley did not have his mobile phone with him, hampering tracing efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police, the fire brigade, the coast guard and volunteers have been searching on and off the island in the eastern Aegean assisted by a helicopter, drones and rescue dogs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, police searches shifted focus to another rocky area, between Pedi and the beach of Agia Marina, after video footage showed Mosley walking through the village of Pedi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The search continues," said spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou. "We are investigating on foot another rocky part, the wider area of Agia Marina."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divers were also involved in the operation and vessels sailing nearby were on alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images from a security camera in Pedi showed what is believed to be Mosley, strolling by at 1:49 pm on Wednesday, holding a sun umbrella, suggesting he may have made it safely off the coastal path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Symi Mayor Lefteris Papakalodoukas said that the images and video footage from security cameras had helped sketch out what authorities believed was Mosley's possible route, which he described as "unconventional."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They indicated that he may have continued further through Pedi into another challenging area around Agia Marina, the mayor said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mosley has appeared on well-known UK TV programmes including Trust Me, I'm a Doctor, The One Show and This Morning. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit on Saturday as the two allies aim to show off their partnership on global security issues and move past trade tensions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday and met separately the following day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris. The leaders both used those engagements to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv's fight against Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv's defence, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France's tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-Élysées leading to the Élysée Palace, where the two held official meetings and were delivering public statements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later, there is a state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Proud to be here," Biden said at the Arc de Triomphe. "A great honour.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the Covid-19 pandemic receded. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli forces rescued four hostages alive from two locations in the central Gaza area of al-Nuseirat on Saturday, the military said, eight months after they were kidnapped by Hamas-led militants in a deadly incursion into Israel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The four hostages, three males and one female who were abducted from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on October 7 last year, were taken to hospital for medical checks, the military said, and were in good health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were identified as Noa Argamani, 25, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After eight months of devastating war in Gaza triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack, 116 of the approximately 250 hostages abducted by militants are left in the Palestinian enclave, according to Israeli tallies – at least 40 of whom have been declared dead in absentia by authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's chief military spokesman said the rescue operation was held under fire in the heart of a residential neighbourhood, where he said Hamas had been concealing hostages among Gaza civilians under the armed guard of militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a televised news conference, spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said one Israeli soldier had been badly injured. Israeli forces returned fire, including with airstrikes, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza health ministry said more than 200 Palestinians were killed and about 400 wounded in the Israeli operation. It did not say how many of the fatalities were combatants but said that women and children were among the dead. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Danish police said on Saturday a 39-year-old man would appear in front of a judge for preliminary questioning in relation to an assault on the country's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in central Copenhagen late on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Frederiksen, leader of Denmark's Social Democratic Party and prime minister since 2019, was shocked after being beaten by a man at Kultorvet square in Copenhagen on Friday, her office said in a statement on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister was able to walk away and had no outward signs of harm after the assault, Soren Kjergaard, who works as a barista in central Copenhagen, told Reuters after seeing her being escorted away by security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the man would be brought before the Copenhagen City Court for questioning at around 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), but declined to provide more detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither the police nor the prime minister's office said anything about the man's motive or whether he had carried a weapon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault comes two days before Danes head to the polls in the European Union election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A month ago, three German politicians suffered assaults ahead of European Parliament and district council elections and more attacks followed earlier this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several EU leaders condemned the incident, which happened just three weeks after Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico was seriously injured in an assassination attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The attack on Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is an intolerable act of violence that represents an attack on the heart of democratic values," Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president said on X:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so shocked at the news of you being assaulted tonight. I condemn this despicable act which goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe. I wish you strength and courage - I know you have plenty of both." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspected organised crime boss in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro was killed on Friday in a shoot-out with police as they tried to arrest him, local authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rio's civil police said in a statement that Rui Paulo Goncalves Estevao, also known as Pipito, was the alleged head of an organized criminal group accused of extortion and sowing terror in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When he was approached, he attacked the agents and a confrontation ensued. The criminal was hit and taken to a local hospital, but died of his wounds," police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rio Governor Claudio Castro said police had dealt a "hard blow against criminals who disturb the peace of the population".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Castro wrote on social media site X that Pipito earlier "gave the order to burn 35 buses" in western Rio neighbourhoods in retaliation for the death of a relative of another alleged crime boss, who is in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rio's organised crime groups, known as militias, were founded about four decades ago by former law enforcement officers and originally presented as self-defence organizations to fight against violent drug traffickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In reality, they function as mafias that control various businesses through extortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militias have also seized public land to illegally build housing or commercial buildings, with real estate becoming a key source of revenue. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong-born retired US astronaut William Anders, who was one of the first three humans to orbit the moon, capturing the famed "Earthrise" photo during Nasa's Apollo 8 mission in 1968, died on Friday in the crash of a small aeroplane in Washington state. He was 90.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NASA chief Bill Nelson paid tribute to Anders on social media with a post of the iconic image of Earth rising over the lunar horizon, saying the former Air Force pilot "offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Heritage Flight Museum near Burlington, Washington, which he co-founded, confirmed that Anders was killed in an aircraft accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was piloting the plane alone when it went down off the coast of Jones Island, part of the San Juan Islands archipelago north of Seattle, between Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, The Seattle Times reported, citing his son, Greg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to television station KCPQ-TV, a Fox affiliate in Tacoma, Anders, a resident of San Juan County, was at the controls of a vintage Air Force single-engine T-34 Mentor that he owned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed on KCPQ showed a plane plunging from the skies in a steep dive before slamming into the water just offshore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US Naval Academy graduate and Air Force pilot, Anders joined Nasa in 1963 as a member of the third group of astronauts. He did not go into space until December 21, 1968, when Apollo 8 lifted off on the first crewed mission to leave Earth orbit and travel 240,000 miles (386,000 km) to the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was the "rookie" on the crew, alongside Frank Borman, the mission commander, and James Lovell, who had flown with Borman on Gemini 7 in 1965 and later commanded the ill-fated Apollo 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apollo 8, originally scheduled for 1969, was pushed forward because of concerns the Russians were accelerating their own plans for a trip around the moon by the end of 1968. That gave the crew only several months to train for the historic but highly risky mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carried by a Saturn V rocket never before used on a crewed flight and tested only twice, the spacecraft faced the delicate and daunting task of entering and leaving lunar orbit safely. Failure meant crashing into the moon or being forever stranded in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recalling the mission 40 years later, Anders acknowledged that although confident of success, he thought "there was a one-third chance" the crew "didn't come back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trepidation turned to triumph when Apollo 8 reached the moon on Christmas Eve and during its 10 orbits captivated a worldwide television audience of more than a billion people by transmitting the first pictures of the lunar surface just miles below.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key part of the mission was photographing the moon, but "after about the third revolution, the moon was clearly kind of a boring place. There was nothing but holes and holes upon holes," Anders said at a symposium in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts' focus shifted abruptly when the Earth began rising over the lunar surface. "Me, Lovell and Borman suddenly said at once: 'Look at that' - this gorgeous, colourful, beautiful planet of ours coming up over the ugly lunar horizon," Anders told Forbes magazine in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a long lens and colour film, Anders ended up snapping the photograph now known as "Earthrise." The image, vividly capturing both the Earth's beauty and fragility in the vastness of space, is considered one of history's most influential photographs, widely credited with helping inspire the environmental movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Here we came all the way to the moon to discover Earth," Anders later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also played a key role in another indelible episode from that Christmas Eve mission - leading off as the crew read from the Book of Genesis while Apollo 8 transmitted images of the lunar surface to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three astronauts were greeted as national heroes when they splashed down three days later in the Pacific Ocean and were feted as Time magazine's "Men of the Year." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was on Friday "hit" by a man on a Copenhagen square, her office said, with EU chiefs quickly condemning the attack.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Danish prime minister's office said in a statement that Frederiksen was "shocked by the incident," but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was hit by a man Friday evening on Kultorvet in Copenhagen. The man was subsequently arrested," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes on the heels of a spate of attacks on politicians from across the political spectrum at work or on the campaign trail in Germany ahead of this week's EU elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On May 15, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was shot four times at close range as he greeted supporters after a government meeting in the central town of Handlova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fico, who survived the assassination attempt, was taken to a hospital in a nearby city after the shooting, where he underwent two lengthy surgeries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EU chief Charles Michel and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola on Friday slammed the attack on Frederiksen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Metsola urged the Danish head of government to "keep strong," while adding in a post to X that "violence has no place in politics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel in turn said he was "outraged by the assault."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I strongly condemn this cowardly act of aggression," the European Council president said in a separate post to X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copenhagen police confirmed that an incident involving the prime minister had occurred but did not provide further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have one person arrested in the case, which we are now investigating. At this time, we have no further comments or remarks on the case," police said in a statement on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I must say that it shakes all of us who are close to her," Danish Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke said in a post to social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Something like this must not happen in our beautiful, safe and free country," he said. (AFP)

    India's Modi elected as leader of coalition

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756569_1_20240608002243.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday was formally elected as the leader of the National Democratic Alliance coalition, which won the most number of seats in the country's national election after his political party failed to win a majority on its own.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 73-year-old leader, who will be sworn in as prime minister on Sunday for a rare third term, will now form a coalition government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi’s Hindu nationalist BJP has governed India as part of the NDA coalition over the past decade, but this is the first time under his leadership that the party has needed support from its regional allies to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This alliance of ours reflects India's spirit in its true sense,” Modi said after the BJP and coalition members backed him as their prime ministerial candidate. “We were neither defeated nor are we defeated ... it was an NDA government in the past, still is and will be,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Full results from India’s six week-long election, which began in mid-April, were released on Wednesday. The BJP won 240 seats, well below the 272 mark needed for a majority in a stunning upset. Together, the parties in the NDA coalition bagged 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Modi's political challenger, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, put up a stronger-than-expected fight, defying predictions of decline by doubling its strength from the last election to win a total of 232 seats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Modi was formally elected as the NDA leader, local media reported that the two key regional allies which can make or break his coalition government – the Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh state and Janata Dal (United) in eastern Bihar state – were eyeing posts in important ministries, some of which the BJP have held so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the newly emboldened opposition ramped up pressure on Modi and the BJP. In a press conference, the Congress party's main campaigner Rahul Gandhi demanded a parliamentary investigation into what he called the “biggest stock market scam,” alleging that Modi and other top BJP ministers misled retail investors who ended up losing money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's two main benchmark stock indexes hit new highs on Monday after exit polls predicted a BJP sweep, but dropped sharply on Tuesday to close down more than 5% as early vote figures trickled in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In television interviews last month, Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah said the markets would surge when results were declared on June 4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BJP denied Gandhi's accusations of a ploy between the party and exit pollsters, and accused the Congress leader of trying to discourage investors. (AP)

    Rishi Sunak apologises for skipping a D-Day ceremony

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The British PM says that "on reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756562_1_20240607234949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak apologised on Friday for leaving D-Day commemorations in France early to return to the election campaign trail – a decision slammed as disgraceful by his political rivals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sunak, who is fighting to keep his job in Britain’s July 4 election , said that, “on reflection” the decision was a mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak was not alongside leaders including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the major memorial event at Omaha Beach in Normandy on Thursday. Former Prime Minister David Cameron, who is now foreign minister, represented the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, the current favourite to win the election, attended and was pictured meeting Zelenskyy and other leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak had earlier attended a ceremony at the British memorial in Normandy alongside King Charles and surviving World War II veterans. He also attended a commemoration in Portsmouth, England, the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion that helped free Europe from the Nazis “should be about those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The last thing I want is for the commemorations to be overshadowed by politics.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: “On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer – and I apologise," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister recorded an interview with broadcaster ITV on Thursday after returning from France, though he said that was not the reason he cut short his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak insisted he “stuck to the itinerary” that had been laid out for him for D-Day weeks before he called the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On reflection it was a mistake not to stay longer and I’ve apologised for that, but I also don’t think it’s right to be political in the midst of D-Day commemorations," he said. "The focus should rightly be on the veterans and their service and sacrifice for our country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A clip released from the interview by ITV showed Sunak denying opposition allegations that he lied by making inaccurate statements about the opposition Labour Party’s tax plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer said “Rishi Sunak will have to answer for his choice” to skip the D-Day event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me there was only one choice. ... There was nowhere else I was going to be," Starmer told broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said it was “a total dereliction of duty” for Sunak to skip the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nigel Farage, leader of the populist Reform UK party, said “patriotic people who love their country” should not vote for Sunak. Farage is seeking to siphon off Conservative voters with his populist, anti-immigration positions. He is sure to raise the D-Day episode in a seven-party televised debate later on Friday. All the main parties will be represented, though Sunak and Starmer are not due to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Craig Oliver, who was communications director to Cameron’s Conservative government, said “the problem for Rishi Sunak this morning is he’s accused of not getting what it is to be a prime minister and what his duties are as a prime minister.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All 650 seats in the House of Commons are up for grabs on July 4. The leader of the party that can command a majority – either alone or in coalition – will become prime minister. (AP)

    Starliner docks at ISS in spite of glitches

<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's two-member Starliner crew received a warm welcome aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on Thursday after successfully docking, a key test of the new spacecraft's flight-worthiness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rendezvous was achieved despite an earlier loss of several guidance-control jet thrusters, some of them due to a helium propulsion leak, which Nasa and Boeing said had been partially fixed and should not compromise the mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CST-100 Starliner, with veteran astronauts Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams aboard, arrived at the orbiting platform after a flight of nearly 27 hours following its launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A live Nasa video feed showed the smiling new arrivals, wearing their blue flight suits, weightlessly floating headfirst through the padded passageway, one after the other, into the station. Williams was first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're just as happy as can be to be up in space," she said during a brief welcoming ceremony a short time later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Starliner autonomously docked with the ISS while both were orbiting some 250 miles over the southern Indian Ocean at 1.34 p.m. EDT, as the two vehicles soared around the globe in tandem at about 17,500 miles per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its US$4.2 billion, fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different US rides to the ISS.

    Cyril Ramaphosa says ANC wants national unity govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday that his African National Congress (ANC) would seek to form a government of national unity with a broad group of opposition parties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of the government of national unity must be, first and foremost, to tackle the pressing issues that South Africans want to be addressed," Ramaphosa said after a marathon ANC meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These issues include job creation and the growth of our economy that will be inclusive, the high cost of living, service delivery, crime and corruption," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In last week's general election, the ANC won just over 40 percent of the vote and 158 seats in South Africa's National Assembly, falling short of an outright majority for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Ramaphosa acknowledged after ten hours of intense talks with his party's senior members at a Johannesburg conference centre, the governing party now needs partners to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There had been speculation the party might seek to form a minority government or a coalition with one or two major parties, but in the end Ramaphosa invited all his rivals to talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such a national dialogue will enhance the pressing task of rebuilding social cohesion in a fractured society, following a particularly toxic and divisive election campaign," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa said ANC negotiators had already held talks with five parties: The leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA), the National Freedom Party (NFP) and the anti-immigrant Patriotic Alliance (PA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All parties must commit to shared nation building and social cohesion," he said. "These values include respect for the constitution of the Republic of South Africa and the rule of law, social justice and equity, human dignity, non-racialism and non-sexism." (AFP)

 Boeing’s space capsule developed more leaks during its first test flight with astronauts as it closed in on the International Space Station on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Starliner capsule already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit on Wednesday. Boeing and Nasa managers were confident they could manage the propulsion system despite the problem and that more leaks were unlikely. But just hours into the flight, two more leaks cropped up. There was no immediate word on the size of these new leaks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leaks pose no safety issues for Nasa test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams or the mission, Boeing spokesman Jim May said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mission managers pressed ahead for a midday docking with the space station while continuing to monitor the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  May said the capsule holds plenty of helium reserves to make up for what's lost. The propulsion system will be disabled once the capsule is docked at the space station since the thrusters will not be needed then, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Helium is used to pressurise the fuel lines of Starliner’s thrusters, which are essential for manoeuvering. Before liftoff, engineers devised a plan to work around any additional leaks in the system. A faulty rubber seal, no bigger than a shirt button, is believed responsible for the original leak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the space shuttles retired, Nasa hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX’s taxi service began in 2020. Boeing was supposed to start around the same time, but was held up for years by safety concerns and other troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing plans to keep Starliner at the space station for at least eight days before guiding it to a landing in the western US. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX's giant Starship rocket survived reentry through Earth's atmosphere on Thursday and splashed down in the Indian Ocean as planned during its fourth test mission after launching from south Texas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-stage spacecraft, consisting of the Starship cruise vessel mounted atop its towering Super Heavy rocket booster, broke apart during its last attempt in March to survive a blazingly hot reentry through Earth's atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the craft survived its reentry on Thursday, a SpaceX livestream showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite loss of many tiles and a damaged flap, Starship made it all the way to a soft landing in the ocean!" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on social media after the splashdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starship, stacked atop its Super Heavy booster, blasted off on Thursday morning from the company's Starbase launch site near Boca Chica Village on the Gulf Coast of Texas. It is the latest trial mission in the test-to-failure rocket development campaign of Elon Musk's company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket system's first stage, called Super Heavy, detached from the Starship upper stage three minutes into flight dozens of kilometres above ground, sending the Starship on its way toward space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Super Heavy headed back toward land and appeared to achieve a soft landing in the Gulf of Mexico. Starship, meanwhile, blasted its own engines to begin its trek around the globe toward the Indian Ocean, a roughly 70-minute trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There, it began its free-fall back to Earth where it endured the intense heat of atmospheric reentry – the crucial point at which it failed in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Designed to be cheaper and more powerful than SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, Starship – standing nearly 122 metres tall – represents the future of the company's dominant satellite launch and astronaut business. It is due to be used by Nasa in the next few years to land the first astronauts on the moon since 1972.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each Starship rocket has made it farther in its testing objectives than previous tests before failing, either by blowing up or disintegrating in the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's first launch in April 2023 exploded minutes after liftoff some 40 kilometres above ground. During the next attempt in November, Starship reached space for the first time but exploded soon after.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its most recent flight in March, Starship made it much farther and broke apart in Earth's atmosphere as it attempted to return from space halfway around the globe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's flight on Thursday was a repeat of its previous test but with the aim to get farther.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket is covered with hundreds of small black tiles designed to protect against the extreme heat encountered while diving through Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main goal of this mission is to get much deeper into the atmosphere during reentry, ideally through max heating," Musk, CEO of SpaceX, wrote on social media on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much is riding on SpaceX's development of Starship, relied upon by Nasa as it aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite Starship's development appearing quicker than other rocket programmes, it has been slower than Musk originally envisioned. A Japanese billionaire who initially paid to fly Starship around the moon cancelled his flight last week, citing schedule uncertainties. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders on Thursday gathered in Normandy to remember those who fought and died on the beaches of northern France 80 years ago, when Allied forces launched "D-Day" to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Moving letters from veterans were read as ceremonies kicked off to mark the 80th anniversary of the June 6, 1944 D-Day landings, when more than 150,000 Allied soldiers invaded France by sea and air.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US leader Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Britain's King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, representing the Allied powers, paid tribute to the tens of thousands of troops who fought on the beaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived to attend the ceremonies and hold talks with the leaders -- a stark reminder of the conflict between his country and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest guests of honour were some 200 surviving veterans in their late 90s or even over 100, some in wheelchairs, huddled in blankets as they gazed over the shores. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian officials on Thursday said an Israeli strike on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed up to 40 people, including 23 women and children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the UN school in Nuseirat had a hidden Hamas command post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people," Thawabta told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack happened after Israel announced a new military campaign in central Gaza as it battles a group of fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people died and more than 20 were injured when a passenger train collided with a freight train in the Czech city of Pardubice late on Wednesday, emergency and government officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least 20 people suffered light injuries and another three were more seriously hurt in the crash which occurred after 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) in Pardubice, along the country's main rail corridor from Prague to the east, Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The passenger train, operated by RegioJet, was travelling overnight from Prague to Kosice in eastern Slovakia, according to the Railway Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fire Rescue Services said more than 300 passengers were on board. Dozens of police, fire and emergency service units responded to the accident, helping evacuate carriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage after the crash on news website idnes.cz showed at least one carriage off the track, while police showed on their X social media account a line of emergency service vehicles and a helicopter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Czech Television cited a fire brigade spokesperson saying the freight train was carrying calcium carbide, although the first two wagons were empty, so no leak occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Martin Kupka, who travelled with the interior minister to the crash site, told a televised briefing an investigation into the accident was beginning and it was too early to speculate on its cause. (Reuters)

    Boeing finally launches rival to SpaceX

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The CST-100 Starliner lifts off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756278_1_20240606034809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a much-delayed first test flight carrying a crew, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew headed for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS), following years of technical problems, delays and a 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad from Florida's Atlantic Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket's upper stage separated from its lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own, the spacecraft fired its onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that will kick off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, the orbiting research outpost some 400 kilometres above Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starliner will need to execute precise manoeuvres to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts - Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Sunita "Suni" Williams - to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing wants the Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing wrote on social media that Starliner "has reached a safe, stable orbit on its Crew Flight Test" and is headed to the space station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Starliner ascends to the heavens," NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the US space agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nelson called the launch "a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hindu-nationalist party of Narendra Modi agreed with allies on Wednesday to form a government after a general election in which it failed to secure an outright majority for the first time in a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-member National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition -- led by Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- has 293 seats in parliament, giving it control of the legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all unanimously choose respected NDA leader Narendra Modi as our leader," a BJP-issued alliance statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the NDA government would "preserve India's heritage" and work for the "all-round development of the country".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election results released on Tuesday upended conventional wisdom throughout the six-week election that Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda would power him to a landslide win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said Modi's reliance on coalition partners means he faces the prospect of a far tougher-than-expected third term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will force Modi to take the point of view of others -- we shall see more democracy and a healthy parliament," said Nilanajan Mukhopadhyay, who has written a biography of Modi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He will have to be a leader that he has never been; we will have to see a new Modi."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian media reports said Modi would be sworn in as prime minister on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China congratulated Modi earlier on Wednesday and said it was "ready to work" with its neighbour, while Japan also applauded the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi, 73, insisted on Tuesday night that the election results were a victory that ensured he would continue his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our third term will be one of big decisions and the country will write a new chapter of development," Modi told a crowd of cheering supporters in the capital New Delhi after his win. "This is Modi's guarantee." (AFP)
