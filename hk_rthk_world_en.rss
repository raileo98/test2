<div class="itemFullText">
 Eurovision 2024 began in the Swedish city of Malmo on Sunday when 37 contenders walked the "Turquoise Carpet" amid heightened security and calls for boycotts due to Israel's participation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 68th version of the song contest, which is always billed as non-political, is taking place against the backdrop of the devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much focus is expected to be on Israeli contestant Eden Golan, when she performs her song "Hurricane" in the second semi-final on Thursday, with bookmakers placing the entry among the top 10 to win the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli delegation did not attend the carpet on Sunday due to Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, said Swedish broadcaster SVT, which co-organises the contest with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel agreed to modify the lyrics of its original song "October Rain", which the EBU said made reference to the October 7 Hamas onslaught.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The contest comprises three live shows, with half a dozen countries having a shot at the title this year, according to fans and bookmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Loreen won the 2023 competition in Liverpool, northern England, with her song "Tattoo", granting the Nordic country an automatic entry into next Saturday's grand final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Big Five" of the EBU - the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy - are also automatically given a spot in the final, while the other contenders will compete in semi-finals for the remaining places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be the seventh time Sweden is hosting the song contest after last doing so in 2016, and the third time Malmo will stage the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden's participants for this year, twins Marcus & Martinus, were drawn in March to open the final with their dance pop song "Unforgettable". (Reuters)

    Gaza ceasefire hopes fade amid impasse

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians look at the rubble left after an Israeli strike on a house in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751914_1_L_20240506005518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prospects for a Gaza ceasefire appeared slim on Sunday as Hamas reiterated its demand for an end to the war in exchange for the freeing of hostages, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flatly ruled that out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two sides blamed each other for the impasse and the Hamas delegation said it would leave Cairo truce talks on Sunday night to consult with its leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In their second day of talks with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, Hamas negotiators maintained their stance that any truce agreement must end the war, Palestinian officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli officials have not travelled to Cairo to take part in indirect diplomacy, but on Sunday Netanyahu reiterated Israel's aim since the start of the war nearly seven months ago: to disarm and dismantle the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas for good or else endanger Israel's future security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister said Israel was willing to pause fighting in Gaza in order to secure the release of hostages still being held by Hamas, believed to number more than 130.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But while Israel has shown willingness, Hamas remains entrenched in its extreme positions, first among them the demand to remove all our forces from the Gaza Strip, end the war, and leave Hamas in power," Netanyahu said. "Israel cannot accept that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indicating that this round of talks may soon unwind, a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort told Reuters on Sunday: "If Netanyahu doesn't change his mind, there will be no reason to stay. They can always reconvene if that changes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The latest round of mediation in Cairo is near to collapse," one official briefed on the talks told Reuters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas did not seem to be serious about reaching a truce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are observing worrying signs that Hamas does not intend to reach an agreement with us," Gallant said. "This means strong military action in Rafah will begin in the very near future, and in the rest of the Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released shortly after Netanyahu's, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group was still keen on reaching a comprehensive ceasefire that ends the Israeli "aggression", guarantees Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, and achieves "a serious" deal to free Israelis being held hostage in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh blamed Netanyahu for "the continuation of the aggression and the expansion of the circle of conflict, and sabotaging the efforts made through the mediators and various parties".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began after Hamas stunned Israel with a cross-border raid on October 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 252 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed, 29 of them in the past 24 hours, and more than 77,000 have been wounded in Israel's assault, according to Gaza's health ministry. The bombardment has devastated much of the coastal enclave and caused a humanitarian crisis. (Reuters)

    Scores dead, missing or injured in Brazil floods

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raging floods and mudslides this past week have killed at least 55 people in southern Brazil and forced nearly 70,000 to flee their homes, the country's civil defence agency said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said least 74 people were injured and another 67 were missing from the catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-rising water levels in the state of Rio Grande do Sul were straining dams and threatening the economically important city of Porto Alegre, home to some 1.4 million residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guaiba River, which flows through the city, was at a historic high of 5.04 metres, well above the 4.76 metres that had stood as a record since the devastating floods of 1941.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities scrambled to evacuate swamped neighbourhoods as rescue workers used four-wheel-drive vehicles -- and even jet skis -- to move through waist-deep water in search of the stranded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence officials also said more than a million people lacked access to potable water amid the flooding, describing damage as incalculable. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian police said on Sunday they had shot dead a boy after he stabbed a man in Western Australia's capital Perth, in an attack authorities said indicated terrorism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  There were signs the 16-year-old, armed with a kitchen knife, had been radicalised online, state authorities said, adding they received calls from concerned members of the local Muslim community before the attack, which occurred late on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack, in the suburb of Willetton, had "hallmarks" of terrorism but was yet to be declared a terrorist act, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage it appears that he acted solely and alone," Western Australia Premier Roger Cook told a televised press conference in the state capital Perth, regarding the attacker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victim, stabbed in the back, was stable in hospital, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had been briefed on the incident by police and intelligence agencies, which advised there was no ongoing threat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are a peace-loving nation and there is no place for violent extremism in Australia," Albanese said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident comes after New South Wales police last month charged several boys with terrorism-related offences in investigations following the stabbing of an Assyrian Christian bishop while he was giving a live-streamed sermon in Sydney, on April 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the bishop came only days after a stabbing spree killed six in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gun and knife crime is rare in Australia, which consistently ranks among the safest countries in the world, according to the federal government. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour leader Keir Starmer has hailed a swing to Labour, just five years after the party was trounced by the Conservatives. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751833_1_L_20240505020621.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's ruling Conservatives on Saturday braced for further losses in local elections, their worst results in recent memory and a key test before a general election to be held by January.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's party lost nearly 500 councillors and control of 12 councils as well as a parliamentary seat, after voting on Thursday across a swathe of England saw the Labour opposition make huge gains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The beleaguered Tory leader faces more likely defeats when results of crunch mayoral races -- in London, Liverpool and Manchester -- are announced later, but is hoping to retain the West Midlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a rare success on Friday, a Tory mayor won a third term in Tees Valley, northeast England -- albeit with a vastly reduced majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour, out of power since 2010 and trounced by Boris Johnson's Conservatives at the last general election in 2019, seized on its claim to the Blackpool South seat in parliament and other successes to demand a national vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let's turn the page on decline," Labour leader Keir Starmer told supporters on Saturday in the East Midlands, where the party won the mayoral race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sunak must order a general election be held by January 28 next year at the latest, and has said he is planning on a poll in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, Sunak conceded the returns showed "voters are frustrated" but insisted "Labour is not winning in places they admit they need for a majority".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We Conservatives have everything to fight for," Sunak concluded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour has enjoyed double-digit poll leads for all of Sunak's 18 months in charge, as previous scandals, a cost-of-living crisis and various other issues dent the Tories' standing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, they were defending nearly 1,000 council seats, many secured in 2021 when they led nationwide polls before the implosion of Johnson's premiership and his successor Liz Truss's disastrous 49-day tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With almost all those results in by Saturday morning, they had lost close to half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If replicated in a nationwide contest, the initial tallies suggested Labour would win 34 percent of the vote, with the Tories trailing by nine points, according to the BBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sky News' projection for a general election using the results predicted Labour will be the largest party but short of an overall majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its by-election scalp in Blackpool -- on a mammoth 26-percent swing -- was the Conservatives' 11th such loss in this parliament, the most by any government since the late 1960s. (AFP)

    Turkey halts trade with Israel until Gaza ceasefire

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey said on Friday it will not resume trade with Israel, worth US$7 billion a year, until a permanent ceasefire and humanitarian aid are secured in Gaza, becoming the first of Israel's key commercial partners to take such a step.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israel's "uncompromising attitude" and the worsening situation in Gaza's Rafah region, a refuge for displaced people that Israel has threatened to storm - prompted Ankara to halt all exports and imports, Trade Minister Omer Bolat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz criticised Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's move, enacted late on Thursday, saying it breaks international trade agreements and was "how a dictator behaves".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, praised the decision as brave and supportive of Palestinian rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Turkey curbed exports of steel, fertiliser and jet fuel among 54 product categories over what it said was Israel's refusal to allow Ankara to take part in aid air-drop operations for Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new ban covers all remaining trade, amounting to US$5.4 billion in Turkish exports - or nearly 6 percent of all of Israel's imports - and US$1.6 billion in imports to Turkey last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top Turkish exports to Israel are steel, vehicles, plastics, electrical devices and machinery, while imports are dominated by fuels at US$634 million last year, Turkish trade data show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey has denounced Israel's military campaign in Gaza, sent thousands of tons of aid for Gazans and, this week, said it would join South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel denies committing acts of genocide in Gaza or violating humanitarian law there. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Friday awarded the country's top civilian honour to Oscar-winning Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh and 18 other people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a ceremony at the White House, the 81-year-old Biden presented Yeoh and other winners with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by placing the award around their necks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House praised Yeoh for continuing to "shatter stereotypes and enrich American culture," as the 61-year-old actress became the first Asian woman to win the best actress Oscar for her performance in "Everything Everywhere All at Once" last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners of the Presidential Medal of Freedom include Biden's Democratic allies - former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, former vice president Al Gore, former secretary of state John Kerry, and former New York mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said the winners have made exemplary contributions to the US, and the world.

  "They are the pinnacle of leadership in their fields. They consistently demonstrated over their careers the power of community, hard work, and service." Biden said.

  Biden himself received the medal of freedom days before former US president Donald Trump entered the White House in January 2017. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian police said on Friday they had arrested and charged three Indian nationals with the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 and said they were probing possible links to the Indian government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nijjar, 45, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, a Vancouver suburb with a large Sikh population. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has cited evidence of Indian government involvement, prompting a diplomatic crisis with New Delhi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said the matter was still under investigation and other probes were being carried out. These "include investigating connections to the government of India," he told a televised news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nijjar was a Canadian citizen campaigning for the creation of Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland carved out of India. The presence of Sikh separatist groups in Canada has long frustrated New Delhi, which had labeled Nijjar a "terrorist".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the White House expressed concern about the reported role of the Indian intelligence service in assassination plots in Canada and the United States. (Reuters)

    Flood-ravaged Kenya braces for first ever cyclone

    <![CDATA[<img alt="William Rutto warns in an address to the nation that Kenya's severe weather is likely to continue. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751706_1_L_20240504012715.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and landslides across Kenya in recent weeks, killing at least 210 people, are forecast to worsen over the rest of this month, President William Ruto said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The floods have wreaked havoc, destroying homes, roads, bridges and other infrastructure across Kenya, East Africa's largest economy. The death toll exceeds that from floods triggered by the El Nino weather phenomenon late last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sadly, we have not seen the last of this perilous period, as the situation is expected to escalate. Meteorological reports paint a dire picture," Ruto said on Kenyan television. "Kenya may face its first-ever cyclone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cyclone Hidaya is expected to make landfall in Tanzania, Kenya's southern neighbour, on Saturday, bringing with it waves almost eight metres high and 165 kph winds, the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Floods have killed more than 160 people in Tanzania since the beginning of April, Tanzania's government spokesman Mobhare Matinyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This cyclone, named Hidaya, that could hit anytime now, is predicted to cause torrential rain, strong winds and powerful and dangerous waves," Ruto said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, Ruto ordered those living in landslide-prone areas to leave for safer ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has asked people living near 178 dams and water reservoirs, now close to overflowing, as well as those in informal settlements close to rivers and streams, to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said the reopening of all schools for the upcoming term, which was meant to start this week, would be postponed until further notice. (Reuters)

    Orangutan seen apparently treating wound

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A male Sumatran orangutan named Rakus is seen two months after wound self-treatment using a medicinal plant. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751628_1_L_20240503133421.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists have observed an orangutan applying medicinal herbs to a face wound in an apparently successful attempt to heal an injury, the first time such behaviour has been recorded.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Primates have previously been seen eating plants or rubbing them on themselves in behaviour scientists theorised was intended to ward off disease or discomfort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the apparent treatment seen by researchers in Indonesia in 2022, and reported in the journal Nature Scientific Reports on Thursday, is the first time a wild animal has been seen applying medicinal plants to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scientists were tracking a male orangutan nicknamed Rakus at the Gunung Leuser National Park in Indonesia's Aceh province when they noticed an open wound on his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three days later, they spotted him chewing the leaves of a vine called Fibraurea tinctoria, which is known for its medicinal properties and has long been used in local traditional medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The orangutan "began chewing the leaves without swallowing them and using his fingers to apply the plant juice from his mouth directly onto his facial wound," said the study by Indonesian and German scientists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When flies began to land on the site, Rakus "smeared the entire wound with the plant pulp until the red flesh was fully covered with the green leaf material."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next day, Rakus was seen eating the vine's leaves again, and a week later his wound had closed up, subsequently healing without any sign of infection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study describes the behaviour as the "first systematically documented case of active wound treatment with a plant species known to contain biologically active substances by a wild animal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said it was impossible to be sure the behaviour was intentional, but the fact that the juice and leaves were applied repeatedly and only to the wound suggests Rakus was trying to treat his injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They speculate the orangutan could have stumbled across the treatment, perhaps by first chewing the plant and then finding the juice offered pain relief when accidently touching it to a wound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orangutans are known to learn skills from each other through observation, but the scientists said they had no record of similar behaviour in 21 years and 28,000 observation hours in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rakus however had moved to the region from elsewhere, raising the possibility he learned the medical technique from a different community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observation adds to a growing body of evidence about the way primates use plants to keep healthy, including swallowing whole leaves that have anti-parasitic properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in Indonesia, orangutans have been seen rubbing the chewed leaves of a different plant into their skin, possibly to harness its anti-inflammatory properties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in 2022, scientists reported on chimpanzees in Gabon that were seen apparently applying insects to wounds. (AFP)

    Boris Johnson caught out by his own photo ID law

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British prime minister Boris Johnson, who introduced a contentious requirement for voters to show photo ID while voting, was turned away from a polling station on Thursday for forgetting to bring his.
 <br>
  <br/>
  British media reported that Johnson, who quit in 2022 following a scandal-ridden premiership, was initially turned away at a polling station in Oxfordshire, southern England, while trying to vote in local elections taking place across England on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said Johnson had voted Conservative but did not deny that the ex-PM had initially failed to produce photo ID.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As prime minister, Johnson's government introduced the ID requirement in 2022 to crack down on possible voter fraud but it was heavily criticised for the potential to disenfranchise parts of the electorate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previously, voters only needed to give their name and address to be able to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it's unreasonable to ask first-time voters to produce some evidence of identity," Johnson had said of the new rules in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, in the first vote where the new rules were implemented, around 14,000 people in England were denied a vote in local elections after being unable to provide ID.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident is the latest in what has been a colourful political career for Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As London mayor he was once left dangling in the air when he got stranded on a zip wire, and as prime minister he was once pictured appearing to retreat into a large refrigerator while being pursued by a camera crew for an interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A poll by YouGov showed 14 percent of Britons were still unaware, in the days prior to Thursday's elections, of the voter ID requirement. (Reuters)

 Thousands of demonstrators blocked a key intersection in Georgia's capital of Tbilisi on Thursday, as protests against a law on "foreign agents" in the country continue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The protesters blocked Heroes' Square through which moves most of the traffic between the city's neighbourhoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgia's parliament on Wednesday approved the second reading of a bill on "foreign agents" that has been criticised as Kremlin-inspired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence, has sparked a political crisis in the South Caucasus country. (Reuters)

    Trump says he may not accept result in key state

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump said he may not accept the 2024 election results in Wisconsin, a key battleground state in his matchup with US President Joe Biden, leaving open the possibility of post-election turmoil.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Wednesday, Trump said that if he doesn’t believe the result in November's election was legitimate, “you have to fight for the right of the country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump added, “If everything’s honest, I will absolutely accept the results.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican presidential candidate's comments came on the heels of an interview this week with Time magazine in which Trump did not rule out the possibility of political violence around the election, saying “it depends on the fairness” of the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Journal Sentinel interview, Trump reiterated his claim that he won Wisconsin – a Midwestern state he lost to Biden, a Democrat, by about 21,000 votes in 2020 – and that the election was tainted by fraud. Trump's campaign unsuccessfully sought to disqualify almost 240,000 ballots cast for Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump won Wisconsin over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, and his rematch this year with Biden is expected to be tight. He held campaign rallies on Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan, another battleground state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said in the newspaper interview he won’t hesitate to raise doubts about the election if he’s convinced something is amiss with the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd be doing a disservice to the country if I said otherwise," Trump said. "But no, I expect an honest election and we expect to win maybe very big." (Reuters)

    Biden says order must prevail on campuses

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden broke his silence on campus unrest over the war in Gaza on Thursday, saying Americans have the right to demonstrate but not to unleash violence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There is a right to protest, but not a right to cause chaos," Biden said in remarks at the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With television images of campus unrest that have swept the country in recent days playing out on news networks, Biden has faced criticism of his handling of the situation. He had been leaving it largely up to his spokespeople to comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democratic president, seeking re-election in November, has walked a careful line of denouncing antisemitism while supporting young Americans' right to protest and trying to limit longer-term political damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said both sides had a point, that peaceful dissent was critical to a democracy but that violence would not be tolerated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelling of classes and graduations -none of this is a peaceful protest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said the United States was not an authoritarian nation that silences critics but that "order must prevail."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Dissent is essential to democracy but dissent must never lead to disorder or denying the rights of others so students can't finish the semester and college education," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, asked whether state governors should call in National Guard troops to restore order if necessary, replied "no."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to a reporter's question, Biden said the campus protests had not forced him to reconsider his policies in the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Student protesters are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and demanding schools divest from companies that support Israel's government. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of helmeted police swarmed the site of a pro-Palestinian protest at the University of California at Los Angeles early on Thursday, arresting demonstrators and dismantling their encampment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pre-dawn police crackdown at UCLA marked the latest flashpoint in mounting tensions on US college campuses, where protests over Israel's war in Gaza have led to student clashes with each other and with law enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prior to moving in, police urged demonstrators in repeated loudspeaker announcements to clear the protest zone, which occupied a central plaza about the size of a football field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After massing around the campus for hours, officers eventually moved through the area in lines holding batons as protesters - some in white helmets - linked arms, attempting to block their advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Live TV footage showed officers taking down tents and removing the encampment, while arrested protesters sat with their hands restrained behind their backs with zip-ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students have rallied or set up tent encampments at dozens of universities in recent days, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and demanding schools divest from companies that support Israel's government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many colleges, including Columbia University in New York City, have called in police to quell the protests. (Reuters)

 Solomon Islands lawmakers selected Jeremiah Manele as their new prime minister on Thursday, elevating the former foreign minister who had pledged to continue the Pacific Island nation's international policy that drew it closer to China.

  A national election last month saw incumbent Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare's government lose half of its seats but failed to deliver a majority to any political party. The government and opposition parties lobbied intensively for weeks to win support from independents ahead of the vote for prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police boosted security in the capital Honiara as newly elected lawmakers arrived at parliament on Thursday to vote in a secret ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The election was closely watched by China, the US and neighbouring Australia because of the potential impact on regional security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he looked forward to working closely with Manele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australia and Solomon Islands are close friends and our futures are connected," he wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's embassy said in a Facebook post it looked forward to working with Manele to develop "China-Solomon Islands relations". (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on Wednesday his country will sever diplomatic ties with Israel, whose leader he described as "genocidal" over its war in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow (Thursday) diplomatic relations with the state of Israel will be severed... for having a genocidal president," Petro, a harsh critic of the war against Hamas, told a May Day rally in Bogota, referring to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's foreign minister on Wednesday said Petro's decision to cut diplomatic ties amounted to handing a "reward" to Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Petro has taken a critical stance on the Gaza assault that followed an unprecedented Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 -- which resulted in the deaths of some 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In October, just days after the start of the war, Israel said it was "halting security exports" to Colombia after Petro accused Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of using language about the people of Gaza similar to what the "Nazis said of the Jews."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel accused Petro of "expressing support for the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists, fueling anti-Semitism," and summoned Colombia's ambassador.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, one of the main providers of arms to Colombia's military, then said it was "halting security exports" to the South American country as the diplomatic feud escalated. (AFP)

    Istanbul police arrest 210 during May Day protests

<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkish police on Wednesday fired tear gas and rubber bullets and detained more than 200 protesters after authorities banned May 1 rallies at Istanbul's historic Taksim Square.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 40,000 police were deployed across Istanbul, blocking even small sidestreets with metal barriers in an attempt to prevent protesters gathering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police clashed with demonstrators near city hall in the Sarachane district, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to stop protesters breaching barricades, AFP reporters said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "210 people were detained in Istanbul after failure to heed our warnings and attempting to walk to the Taksim Square and attack our police officers on May 1 Labour and Solidarity Day," Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tall metal barriers were put up around the square, where authorities have banned rallies since 2013, when it was the focus of demonstrations against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have demonstrated our will to celebrate May Day at Taksim Square. We have legal grounds," Arzu Cerkezoglu, secretary general of the Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey (DISK) told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taksim is an important symbol for us. Taksim means May Day, Taksim means labour," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, Turkey's top constitutional court ruled that the closure of Taksim Square for protests was a violation of rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The square was a rallying ground for May Day celebrations until 1977, when at least 34 people were killed during demonstrations. Authorities opened it up again in 2010, but it was shut again after the 2013 protests. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="NYPD officers arrest a student as they evict a building that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian student protesters at Columbia University. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751343_1_L_20240501105700.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nation's human rights chief has voiced concern over heavy-handed steps to remove protesters from university campuses in the United States where pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been taking place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The statement comes as dozens of helmeted police on Tuesday night marched onto Columbia University in New York City – the epicentre of the student protests – and began evicting a building that had been barricaded by pro-Palestinian student protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to society – particularly when there is sharp disagreement on major issues,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It continued by saying that many of the protests have been held without incident and that at a number of locations, they have been dispersed or dismantled by security forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of students have been arrested, while others face charges or academic sanctions, the statement said, adding that enforcement actions by universities or law enforcement to restrict such expression "need to be carefully scrutinised".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement continued by quoting Türk as saying: “I am concerned that some of [the] law enforcement actions across a series of universities appear disproportionate in their impacts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations – the most sweeping and prolonged unrest to rock US college campuses since the Vietnam war protests of the 1960s and 70s – have posed a challenge to university administrators trying to balance free speech rights with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unrest has swept through US higher education institutions like wildfire, with many student protesters erecting tent encampments on campuses from coast to coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage of police in riot gear summoned at various colleges has been viewed around the world. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Binance chief Zhao jailed for four months

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Changpeng Zhao arrives for his sentencing hearing in Seattle. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751333_1_L_20240501094516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Changpeng Zhao, the former chief executive of Binance, was sentenced on Tuesday to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Once considered the most powerful crypto industry figure, Zhao, known as "CZ," is the second major crypto boss to be sentenced to prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sentence imposed by US District Judge Richard Jones in Seattle was significantly shorter than the three years sought by prosecutors, and below the maximum one and a half years recommended under federal guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was also much lighter than the 25 years behind bars that Sam Bankman-Fried received in March for stealing US$8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried is appealing his conviction and sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, prosecutors cheered the outcome of what had been a years-long investigation into Binance and Zhao, a billionaire who had been living beyond US reach in the United Arab Emirates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was an epic day,” US Attorney Tessa Gorman told reporters outside the courthouse. “Incarceration was critical in this case and we’re pleased with the result.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before handing down the sentence, Jones faulted Zhao for making Binance's growth and profitability a higher priority than complying with US laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You had the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to make sure that every single regulation had to be complied with, and so you failed at that opportunity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhao, 47, did not visibly react upon hearing his sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "'Crime pays' is the message sent today," Dennis Kelleher, head of the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in an email, noting Zhao will still get to keep his vast wealth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors said Binance employed a "Wild West" model that welcomed criminals, and did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm sorry," Zhao told the judge before being sentenced. (Reuters)

    Georgia police break up 'foreign agents' law protest

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police use water cannon to disperse protesters in Tbilisi. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751328_1_L_20240501090726.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgian security forces used water cannon, tear gas and stun grenades against protesters outside parliament late on Tuesday, sharply escalating a crackdown after lawmakers debated a "foreign agents" bill which is viewed by the opposition and Western nations as authoritarian and Russian-inspired.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eyewitnesses said they saw some police officers physically attack protesters, who threw eggs and bottles at them, before using tear gas, water cannon and stun grenades to force demonstrators from the area outside the parliament building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Levan Khabeishvili, the leader of Georgia's largest opposition party, the United National Movement, posted a picture on X with his face bloodied and sporting a black eye. A party official said Khabeishvili was beaten by police after disappearing from central Tbilisi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After being dispersed from parliament, around two thousand protesters continued to block Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue, barricading it with cafe tables and rubbish bins. Some shouted "Slaves" and "Russians" at police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, riot police used pepper spray and batons to clear some protesters who were trying to prevent lawmakers from leaving the back entrance of parliament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili,  whose powers are mostly ceremonial, said in a post on X the crackdown had been "totally unwarranted, unprovoked and out of proportion," and that the protests had been peaceful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill has heightened divisions in the southern Caucasus country, setting the ruling Georgian Dream party against a protest movement backed by opposition groups, civil society, celebrities and the figurehead president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parliament, which is controlled by the Georgian Dream and its allies, is likely to approve the bill, which must pass two more readings before becoming law. Lawmakers ended Tuesday's session without a vote and the debate will resume on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, a government-organised rally in support of the bill was attended by tens of thousands of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At that rally, former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a billionaire who founded Georgian Dream, told attendees that a "global party of war" had hijacked the EU and Nato and that it was bent on using those institutions to undermine Georgian sovereignty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill would require organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as "foreign agents". Georgian critics have labelled the bill "the Russian law", comparing it to Moscow's "foreign agent" legislation, which has been used to crack down on dissent there. (Reuters)

    Israel PM warns of Rafah attack 'with or without' deal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Palestinian woman stands at the entrance of a tent in an area housing displaced people in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751299_1_L_20240501001655.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Tuesday to launch a ground offensive on the Gaza Strip's far-southern city of Rafah "with or without" a truce deal being agreed with Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hawkish premier issued the warning despite strong concerns raised by top ally Washington and hours before US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was set to arrive in Israel on his latest Middle East crisis tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu promised "total victory" and said stopping the war "before achieving all of its goals is out of the question".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal," he told families of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza, his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu's comments came as Hamas was weighing the latest plan for a truce proposed in Cairo talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators that had raised cautious hopes for an end to the fighting after nearly seven months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian militant group said it was considering a plan for a 40-day ceasefire and the exchange of scores of hostages for larger numbers of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington has heightened pressure on all sides to reach a ceasefire - a message pushed by Blinken, who was on his seventh regional tour since the war broke out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As diplomacy continued, Israel kept up its bombardment that has flattened swathes of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An AFP correspondent reported air strikes on Gaza City, Khan Yunis and Rafah, while Israel said "fighter jets struck a number of terror targets in central Gaza".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinians in Rafah mourned the latest victims as children were being pulled from the rubble. (AFP)

    Protesters take over Columbia University building

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters take over Hamilton Hall on the Columbia University campus in New York. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751214_1_L_20240430155836.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University in New York early on Tuesday, barricading the entrances and unfurling a Palestinian flag out of a window in the latest escalation of demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war that have spread to US college campuses nationwide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed protesters on Columbia's Manhattan campus locking arms in front of Hamilton Hall and carrying furniture and metal barricades to the building, one of several that was occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest on the campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Posts on an Instagram page for protest organisers shortly after midnight urged people to protect the encampment and join them at Hamilton Hall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The student radio station, WKCR-FM, broadcast a play-by-play of the hall’s takeover, which occurred nearly 12 hours after Monday’s 2pm deadline for the protesters to leave an encampment of around 120 tents or face suspension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Representatives for the university did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Universities across the US are grappling with how to clear out encampments as commencement ceremonies approach, with some continuing negotiations and others turning to force and ultimatums that have resulted in clashes with police. Dozens of people were arrested on Monday during protests at universities in Texas, Utah and Virginia, while Columbia said hours before the takeover of Hamilton Hall that it had started suspending students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators are sparring over the Israel-Hamas war and its mounting death toll, and the number of arrests at campuses nationwide is approaching 1,000 as the final days of class wrap up. The outcry is forcing colleges to reckon with their financial ties to Israel, as well as their support for free speech. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into anti-semitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, student activists at Columbia defied the 2pm deadline to leave the encampment. Instead, hundreds of protesters remained. A handful of counter-demonstrators waved Israeli flags, and one held a sign reading, “Where are the anti-Hamas chants?”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the university didn’t call police to roust the demonstrators, school spokesperson Ben Chang said suspensions had started but could provide few details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protest organisers said they were not aware of any suspensions as of Monday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Columbia’s handling of the demonstrations also has prompted federal complaints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A class-action lawsuit on behalf of Jewish students alleges a breach of contract by Columbia, claiming the university failed to maintain a safe learning environment, despite policies and promises. It also challenges the move away from in-person classes and seeks quick court action requiring Columbia to provide security for the students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a legal group representing pro-Palestinian students is urging the US Department of Education’s civil rights office to investigate Columbia’s compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for how they have been treated. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mount Ruang spews ash almost 2 kilometres into the sky. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751210_1_L_20240430154836.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia’s Mount Ruang volcano erupted on Tuesday for a second time in two weeks, spewing ash almost 2 kilometres into the sky, closing an airport and peppering nearby villages with debris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alert level of the volcano on Sulawesi Island was again raised to the highest level by the Indonesian geological service, after sensors picked up increasing volcanic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency urged residents and climbers to stay at least 6 kilometres from the volcano’s crater.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 725-metre volcano in North Sulawesi province is about 95 kilometres northeast of Sam Ratulangi International Airport in Manado, the provincial capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airport was closed on Tuesday morning due to reduced visibility and the dangers posed to aircraft engines by ash, said Ambar Suryoko, head of the regional airport authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ash, grit and rock fell from the sky in towns and cities across the region, including Manado, a city with more than 430,000 people where motorists had to switch on their headlights during daytime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was dark with rocks raining at the post from the eruption,” said Yulius Ramopolii, the head of Mount Ruang monitoring post. “The vibrations were intense and knocked out power, and volcanic earthquakes shook the glass windows and everything around us.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the eruption blocked out the sun and peppered several villages with falling debris. No casualties have been reported, Ramopolii said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 11,000 people had evacuated after the April 17 eruption when authorities warned that a major eruption might collapse part of the volcano into the sea and cause a tsunami that could endanger nearby villages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fewer than 3,000 remained at temporary shelters after the government lowered its alert level to the second highest from four levels and reopened the airport after four days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia’s geological agency on Tuesday warned people on Tagulandang Island, especially those who live near the coast, of the potential of hot volcanic clouds and a tsunami due to eruptions of material entering the sea or collapse of volcanic dome into the sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruang is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia. The country is prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” – a series of fault lines stretching from the western coasts of the Americas through Japan and Southeast Asia. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn will retire, the bank said on Tuesday, in a surprise departure from the business that he has overhauled in the past five years through a sweeping series of asset sales across the globe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bank said it has already launched a formal process to find a successor, with Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery likely the leading internal candidate for the job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, HSBC reported a 1.8 percent drop in first-quarter profit as it struggles to cope with rising costs from expansion in Asia and amid inflationary pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pretax profit came in at US$12.7 billion for the quarter ended March versus US$12.9 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results were better than the US$12.6 billion average of analysts' forecasts compiled by HSBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-headquartered bank also announced US$3 billion worth of share buybacks on top of US$2 billion in share purchases announced in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking during a media call, Quinn said he informed the group's chairman Mark Tucker of his decision last month, saying he wanted to have a better work-life balance after an "intense" five-year period in the top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would never have dreamed of being the CEO in the bank 37 years ago and it's a privilege. But you also have to look forward and say what's right for you personally, and I did a lot reflecting on that over Christmas, the New Year, and January," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's right for me, but also think it's right for the bank, it's a natural transition point for the bank," adding he would work hard to ensure a smooth transition for his successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tucker thanked Quinn for his leadership and for his years of work at the bank, and said he and the board fully "support and respect that decision". (Reuters)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HSBC group chairman also said the board and its nomination committee hoped to name a new chief executive in the second half of this year.

    Nato chief says 'not too late' for Ukraine to win war

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday it was "not too late" for Ukraine to win the war, agreeing with President Volodymyr Zelensky that Kyiv needs more weapons, while Russian forces advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg was in Ukraine when Russia claimed the capture of two eastern villages in 24 hours, rushing an advance in the Donetsk region before crucial US weapons reach Kyiv's exhausted forces on the front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ukraine has been outgunned for months, forced to ration its ammunition... But it's not too late for Ukraine to prevail," the Nato secretary general said at a press conference with Zelensky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said months-long delays in US military aid to Ukraine had "serious consequences on the battlefield."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said that "more support is on the way."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our allies are looking into what more they can do and I expect new announcements soon. So we are working hard to meet Ukraine's urgent needs," he promised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine has been dependent on Western military aid to counter Russia's larger and more powerful army.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky urged faster deliveries to bolster the front line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Russian army is now trying to take advantage of the situation when we are expecting supplies from our partner," the Ukrainian leader said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is why promptness in supply literally means stabilisation of the front line," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together we must disrupt the Russian offensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking of the long-awaited aid, Zelensky said "some things have started to arrive" but declined to "go into details."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden gave final approval for the aid – blocked in Congress for months – last week, saying shipments will start "right away."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, Ukraine said the situation was deteriorating for its troops in the eastern Donetsk region. (AFP)

    Dozens killed as dam bursts in flood-hit Kenya
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The resulting deluge uprooted trees, washed away several homes and sent vehicles flying. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751105_1_L_20240430014308.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 46 people including children died when a makeshift dam burst its banks in Kenya's Rift Valley in the early hours of Monday, a local official said, as torrential rains and floods battered the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people have been killed over the March-May wet season in Kenya as heavier than usual rainfall pounds East Africa, compounded by the El Nino weather pattern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents said the accident occurred in the dead of night when the dam burst near the town of Mai Mahiu in Nakuru county, sending torrents of water and mud gushing down a hill and engulfing everything in its path.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deluge cut off a road, uprooted trees, washed away homes and sent vehicles flying, devastating the village of Kamuchiri.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We heard what sounded like an earthquake and roars like a moving train," said Margaret Wangechi, a 52-year-old teacher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, said on Monday evening that there were 46 bodies at the mortuary, but warned that the number could increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dead included 20 women and 17 children, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nakuru governor Susan Kihika said 110 people were being treated in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers dug through the debris, using hoes and in some cases just their bare hands in a desperate search for survivors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We collected some of the bodies held by trees and we don't know how many are under the mud," Stephen Njihia Njoroge, a local resident involved in the emergency efforts, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disaster occurred at Old Kijabe dam, a hillside barrier formed naturally over decades after railway construction work by Kenya's former British colonial rulers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Red Cross has set up a desk at a local school to help families find lost loved ones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the government had called for inspections of all dams and reservoirs within 24 hours in case there is a need for evacuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said on X that the authorities would arrest people engaging in "risky behaviour," including motorists attempting dangerous crossings and anyone seeking to transport "passengers across flooded rivers or storm water by unsafe canoes or boats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came after a crowded boat capsized at the weekend in flooded Tana River county in eastern Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kindiki said two bodies had been found and 23 people rescued, and that search and rescue efforts were ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kenyan government spokesman said on Monday that 103 people had lost their lives in floods since March, in a statement that did not mention the dam disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 28,000 households have been displaced and over 185,000 people affected, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The education ministry announced on Monday it would postpone the reopening of schools following mid-term holidays to May 6 because of the rains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weather has also wreaked havoc in neighbouring Tanzania, where at least 155 people have been killed in flooding and landslides. (AFP)

    Blinken 'hopeful' Hamas will accept Gaza deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday he was hopeful Hamas would accept an "extraordinarily generous" offer to halt Israel's Gaza offensive in return for the release of hostages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel," Blinken said in Riyadh at the World Economic Forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to decide – and they have to decide quickly," Blinken said. "I'm hopeful that they will make the right decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can have a fundamental change in the dynamic" in more than half-a-year of bloodshed, Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A delegation from Hamas was due on Monday in Egypt, which with Qatar has been seeking to broker a deal that would halt the Israeli offensive and see hostages freed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also discussed the ceasefire proposal on Monday in Riyadh with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan of Turkey, where Hamas maintains an office and the militants' chief Ismail Haniyeh is a frequent visitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken in the talks with Fidan "urged that all efforts be brought to bear to convince Hamas to accept the immediate ceasefire proposal that is on the table," a State Department statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey recognises Israel but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a strident critic of its Gaza offensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erdogan has voiced an eagerness for a greater role in mediating the Gaza conflict after Qatar in recent weeks indicated it would take a step back. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751063_1_L_20240429174052.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday said that after a period of reflection about his future he had decided to continue as the country's leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said he had informed King Felipe VI of his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His decision to continue draws a line under a week in which Spanish politics was thrown into further turmoil by the prospect of facing another parliamentary vote to choose a new prime minister or even a fourth general election in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, 52, surprised both foes and allies alike when he said last Wednesday he was taking several days away from public duty to consider quitting, provoking large demonstrations from his followers in the country over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his announcement on the same day a court said it would investigate his wife, Begona Gomez, for influence peddling and business corruption, allegations he said were false and orchestrated by his conservative opponents. (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751018_1_L_20240429130317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday arrived in Riyadh at the start of a new trip to the Middle East aimed at pushing for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire and increasing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat will also visit Jordan and Israel on his seventh visit to the region since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel which triggered the Israeli assault on Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Saudi Arabia, Blinken was expected hold new talks with the Saudi leadership on potential normalisation of relations with Israel, a US State Department official said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saudi Arabia was considering the step -- which would carry massive significance as the kingdom is guardian of Islam's two holiest sites -- before October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has sought to keep up momentum, dangling the prospect of normalisation to encourage moderation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a long-time opponent of Palestinian statehood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will also meet in Riyadh with a number of Gulf Arab and European foreign ministers who are visiting for a World Economic Forum meeting and Gulf Cooperation Council talks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken will discuss "day-after" plans for reconstruction of post-war Gaza, according to the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans could include funding to rebuild Gaza -- the vast majority of whose people have been displaced -- or support for installing new governance structures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrived hours after US President Joe Biden and Netanyahu spoke by phone about ongoing talks to halt Israel's offensive in Gaza in return for the release of hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce between Israel and Hamas for months, as public pressure mounts for a deal. (AFP)

    Four dead after tornadoes strike Oklahoma

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least four people died, including a four-month-old baby, and scores were injured in the state of Oklahoma after dozens of twisters swept the US Southern Plains, while weather alerts on Sunday put more than 7 million Americans under tornado warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Sunday declared a disaster emergency for the state, freeing up more money for first responders and recovery operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Definitely the most damage since I've been governor," Stitt said in Sulphur, one of the hardest-hit communities, as he provided an update on fatalities and damage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stitt began his first term as governor in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a call with the Oklahoma governor, President Joe Biden offered the full support of the federal government to help with the recovery efforts, the White House said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Storm warnings for high winds, heavy rain and hail also were issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) on Sunday for more than 47 million people stretching from East Texas north through Illinois and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NWS reported 38 possible twisters hit the area and that the worst of the storms rolled through Central Oklahoma on Saturday into early Sunday morning, spreading into northwest Texas, western Missouri and Kansas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said area hospitals reported 100 injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twisters destroyed or damaged dozens of structures, including the hospital in the town of Marietta, although no injuries were reported there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20,000 customers in the state remained without power as of Sunday evening, according to officials, as emergency personnel worked to clear roads and repair power lines. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will host a meeting of state and territory leaders on Wednesday to discuss a coordinated response towards violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands protested in cities around the country at the weekend to draw attention to the deaths of 27 women so far this year allegedly caused by acts of gender-based violence in a population of 27 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese on Monday described domestic violence as a “national crisis”, and said the rallies were a call to action for all levels of Australian government to do more to prevent gender-based violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Quite clearly, we need to do more. It’s not enough to just have empathy,” Albanese told Nine Network television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact that... a woman dies every four days on average at the hand of a partner is just a national crisis,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 17 rallies held across Australia over the weekend, with an estimated 15,000 people demonstrating in the city of Melbourne.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese, his Women’s Minister Katy Gallagher and Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth received a hostile response when they attended a rally in the capital Canberra on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters yelled at the government leaders, “we want action” and “do your job.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said there needed to be more focus on perpetrators and prevention of violence. “We need to change the culture, we need to change attitudes, we need to change the legal system,” he told the rally. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's army leader admitted on Sunday that Kyiv's position on the battlefield has worsened after Russian forces captured another village in the east, pressing their advantage in manpower and ammunition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia's troops are advancing in the eastern Donetsk region as Kyiv awaits the arrival of much-needed US weapons that it hopes will stabilise the fragile front lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation at the front has worsened," Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said in a Facebook post on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian troops had "retreated" westwards to new defensive lines in a section of the front that runs past the city of Donetsk, controlled by pro-Russian forces since 2014.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has "a significant advantage in forces and means" and had been able to notch up advances amid "heavy fighting," Syrsky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some sectors the enemy had tactical success, and in some areas our troops managed to improve the tactical position," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry earlier on Sunday claimed its troops had captured the village of Novobakhmutivka in the Donetsk region – around 10 kilometres north of Avdiivka, which they seized in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The stark assessment of the picture facing Ukrainian troops comes at the end of week of ups and downs for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States finally approved a US$61 billion package of financial aid after months of political wrangling, unlocking much-needed arms for Ukraine's stretched troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on the battlefield Russia chalked up more successes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its troops managed to make rapid advances in a narrow column to the northwest of Avdiivka. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Sunday and "reviewed ongoing talks" to free hostages taken by Hamas during their October 7 attack on Israel, the White House said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two allies "reviewed ongoing talks to secure the release of hostages together with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza," the White House statement said, as diplomatic efforts intensified to reach a long-sought truce in the war-battered region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli government has come under intense pressure from its global allies to reach a ceasefire, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by the Palestinian militant group during the attack that triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce for months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Netanyahu "also discussed increases in the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza including through preparations to open new northern crossings starting this week," the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The President stressed the need for this progress to be sustained and enhanced in full coordination with humanitarian organisations," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With humanitarian agencies sounding ever more dire warnings of a crisis in Gaza, Israel has come under increasing pressure – globally and from the United States specifically – to allow more aid into the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also "reiterated his clear position" on any Israeli assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, the statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has vowed to send troops into Rafah, where more than 1.5 million civilians have taken refuge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Biden administration, while backing Israel, has repeatedly voiced alarm over the heavy toll on civilians in the Gaza offensive and has pressed Israel to hold off on any Rafah assault. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Meteorologists are warning of the danger of more extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750954_1_L_20240429013412.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An exceptional number of powerful tornadoes have ravaged parts of Oklahoma and nearby Great Plains states in the US, with one small town reportedly hit by two separate tornadoes within hours, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After 78 tornadoes were reported on Friday, mostly in Nebraska and Iowa, a separate weather system on Saturday brought 35 tornado reports from northern Texas to Missouri, the National Weather Service said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least two people, including a four-month-old child, died in the Oklahoma town of Holdenville, according to multiple reports in state and local media, though crews on Sunday were still sifting through the mounds of rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storms dumped up to 18 centimetres of rain in some places within hours, and meteorologists warned of a continuing danger of extreme weather on Sunday, including flash flooding, hail and more tornadoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos and images posted on social media showed scores of building flattened in the small town of Sulphur, in south-central Oklahoma, with vehicles smashed or overturned and trees stripped of branches and leaves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Postal trucks in Sulphur rested precariously atop the nearly unrecognisable wreckage of buildings, one video showed. Rescue crews went house to house and vehicle to vehicle in search of victims or survivors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "DO NOT COME TO SULPHUR UNLESS YOU ARE A FIRST RESPONDER!!!" the Murray County sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tornado that struck Ardmore, Oklahoma tossed debris up to 6,100 metres high, the Washington Post reported. Then two other tornadoes came close to the town in the ensuing two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt declared a 30-day state of emergency to expedite aid to 12 of the hardest-hit counties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 50,000 homes in Texas and more than 30,000 in Oklahoma were without power as of late Sunday morning, the poweroutage.us website reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The region is known for the frequency and power of the tornadoes that rumble through every spring. But having separate major outbreaks in succeeding days is exceedingly rare, meteorologists said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Diplomatic efforts intensified on Sunday to reach a long sought-after truce and hostage-release deal in Gaza, as Hamas said it would travel to mediator Egypt to deliver its response to Israel's latest proposal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli government has come under intense pressure to reach a ceasefire from its global allies, as well as from protesters within Israel demanding the release of hostages seized by Hamas during their October 7 attack that triggered the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas delegation will arrive in Egypt on Monday to deliver the group's response to Israel's new hostage and truce counterproposal, a senior official of the militant group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate a new truce ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas has previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire – a condition that Israel has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the Axios news website, citing two Israeli officials, reported that Israel's latest proposal includes a willingness to discuss the "restoration of sustainable calm" in Gaza after hostages are released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is the first time in the nearly seven-month war that Israeli leaders have suggested they are open to discussing an end to the war, Axios said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hamas source close to the negotiations said that the group "is open to discussing the new proposal positively."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The source added that the group is "keen to reach an agreement that guarantees a permanent ceasefire, the free return of displaced people, an acceptable deal for (prisoner) exchange and ensuring an end to the siege" in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new hopes of a potential truce came as world leaders and humanitarian groups warned that a looming Israeli invasion of the southernmost city of Rafah would lead to massive civilian causalities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas appealed to the US to stop Israel from invading Rafah, which he said would be "the biggest disaster in the history of the Palestinian people." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pro-Palestinian protesters stand in front of a police barricade after officers raid an encampment at Northeastern University in Boston. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750889_2_L_20240428112831.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police detained nearly 200 people at three US universities on Saturday as they cleared pro-Palestinian encampments, in the latest campus clashes triggered by protests over Israel's war against Hamas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the East Coast, police in Boston detained about 100 people while clearing a protest camp at Northeastern University, with social media posts showing security forces in riot gear and officers loading tents onto the back of a truck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action was taken after some protesters resorted to "virulent anti-Semitic slurs, including 'Kill the Jews,'" Northeastern University said in a statement on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the opposite side of the country, Arizona State University police arrested 69 people for trespassing after the group set up an "unauthorised encampment" on campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arizona State officials said a protest group – "most of whom were not ASU students, faculty or staff" – had set up a camp on Friday and then ignored repeated orders to disperse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in the US heartland, police at Indiana University arrested 23 people as they cleared a campus protest camp, the Indiana Daily Student newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police with shields, batons and other riot gear broke through a line of protesters who had linked arms, tackling those who did not move, the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campus activists are calling for a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas, as well as for colleges to sever ties with the country and with companies they say profit from the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The protests have posed a major challenge to university administrators who are trying to balance commitments to free expression with complaints that the rallies have veered into anti-Semitism and hate speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have carried out large-scale arrests at universities in recent days, at times using chemical irritants and tasers to disperse demonstrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on X, Northeastern said the area on campus where the protests were held was now "fully secured" and "all campus operations have returned to normal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said it made the move after "what began as a student demonstration two days ago was infiltrated by professional organisers with no affiliation to Northeastern."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that detained individuals who produced a valid school ID have been released and will face disciplinary proceedings, not legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Those who refused to disclose their affiliation were arrested," the school said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of students remained encamped on Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania, despite the college president ordering disbandment after what he said were "credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York, where the protests originated, was relatively calm. Officials there announced on Friday that they would not be calling police back to campus after more than 100 people were arrested last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To bring back the NYPD at this time would be counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community," school leaders said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada saw its first campus protest camp spring up on Saturday at McGill University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school in Montreal said such encampments, which are not permitted, increase "the potential for escalation and confrontation, as we have seen at some colleges throughout the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas militants staged an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian militants also took roughly 250 people hostage. Israel estimates 129 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,388 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    Cambodian army base blast kills 20 soldiers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An ammunition explosion at a base in southwestern Cambodia killed 20 soldiers and wounded several others, Prime Minister Hun Manet said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hun Manet said in a Facebook post that he was “deeply shocked” when he received the news of the blast on Saturday afternoon at the base in Kampong Speu province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It wasn't immediately clear what caused it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images from the scene showed several badly damaged buildings still smoldering, at least one with its roof blown off, and soldiers receiving treatment in a hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other photos showed houses with holes in their roofs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four buildings – three for storage and one work facility – were destroyed and several military vehicles damaged, Colonel Youeng Sokhon, an army officer at the site, said in a brief report to army chief General Mao Sophan, posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that 25 villagers' homes were damaged as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kiripost, an online English language news service, quoted a nearby resident as saying a major explosion occurred at about 2.30pm, followed by smaller blasts for another hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pheng Kimneang was quoted as saying the windows of a factory nearby were shattered, and homes as far as a kilometre (a half-mile) away suffered minor damage. Photos of the base show it in a large field, apparently with no civilian structures close by.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hun Manet offered condolences to the soldiers’ families and promised the government would pay for their funerals and provide compensation both to those killed and those wounded. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of people protested in Australian cities on Saturday, demanding more be done to stop violence against women.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At events in Sydney and Adelaide, demonstrators carried banners saying "no excuse for abuse" and asked the government to step in and prevent violence that has claimed dozens of lives already this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese backed the protests and vowed to march at further events planned for Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A woman has been killed every four days so far this year," he posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow I will walk with women across Australia to say enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Governments need to do better, men need to step up and as a society, we must do better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also took part in a demonstration in Sydney, and said change was desperately needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The issue of violence against women has come to the fore in Australia after a spate of high-profile murder cases and a knife attack on a Sydney mall that left five women dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, police arrested former "Home and Away" actor Orpheus Pledger, after he allegedly failed to appear in court to face charges of assaulting a woman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers in the advocacy group What Were You Wearing have called three days of protests from Friday to Sunday, saying "29 Women have been killed to men's violence since the start of 2024. Enough is enough." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The creative director behind the girl band NewJeans has found online fame after a tearful, profanity-laced news conference in which she slammed some of K-pop's most powerful executives.
 <br>
  <br/>
  HYBE, the South Korean agency behind K-pop sensation BTS, filed a legal complaint on Thursday against Min Hee-jin, the head of its powerhouse subsidiary label ADOR, for breach of trust in business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed an announcement three days earlier that it had launched an audit of ADOR and demanded that Min resign. HYBE's share price fell close to 10 percent after the audit was announced and closed on Friday down 4.95 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, 44, hit back in a news conference on Thursday that drew empathy online from young working men and women who compared her story with their own experiences with unreasonable and jealous bosses who either took credit for their work or failed to acknowledge it fairly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, however, said she had acted inappropriately and unprofessionally by occasionally lapsing into profanity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She denied HYBE's accusations and claimed it was trying to dismiss her unfairly after she accused another of its subsidiaries, BELIFT LAB, of imitating NewJeans with a girl group of its own called ILLIT.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, speaking off the cuff and often breaking down in tears, candidly shared her frustrations for more than two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She referred to HYBE's leaders, including chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the man behind BTS, as "gaejeossi", which translates roughly to a "middle-aged or old male fool".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel betrayed by HYBE... they used me until I was no longer of use to them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The live-streamed event, during which even her lawyers appeared embarrassed, had millions of views and drew an explosive public response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One parody YouTube video seen by 2.5 million viewers combined a clip of Min speaking passionately with hip-hop music. The t-shirt and baseball cap she was wearing sold out on several online platforms and many others said they had suffered similar experiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Women who have truly worked (hard) and experienced being undermined by men, along with the dirty side of office politics, could never speak ill of Min Hee-jin," a South Korean woman said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee Moon-won, a culture critic who watched the news conference, said Min sidestepped the real allegations against her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No figure as influential as Min in the entertainment industry has ever used curse words during an official press conference, people have really never seen anything like it, so this obviously has attracted enormous attention," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As one of few successful women producers in the industry, Min has been recognised for her arresting visual imagery on numerous K-pop hits, including Girls' Generation's "Gee" and EXO's "Growl".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NewJeans has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Min said HYBE chairman Bang never congratulated her on NewJeans' debut and that the parent company had given promotional priority to another of its K-pop groups, Le Sserafim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HYBE rejected Min's accusations and urged her again to resign and stop discussing NewJeans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts criticised both Min and HYBE over a scandal that has gripped much of South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  K-pop columnist Isak Choi said those involved showed "incompetence and vulgarity by not hesitating to publicly display infighting".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just because Min criticised HYBE's leadership, "it doesn't mean she is free from the rotten issues of this industry", Choi wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She cannot become the underdog simply because she is fighting with the management, especially after having gained astronomical benefits from within it." (AFP)

    Hamas studies Israeli ceasefire counter proposal

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinian youths search the rubble of a building in Rafah. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750810_1_L_20240427135220.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said it was studying on Saturday the latest Israeli counter proposal regarding a potential ceasefire in Gaza, a day after a delegation from mediator Egypt reportedly arrived in Israel in a bid to jump-start stalled negotiations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The signs of fresh truce talks came alongside ongoing Israeli preparations for a military push into Gaza's southern city of Rafah and as spillover from the war led to continued attacks across the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, the Hamas movement received the official Zionist occupation response to the movement's position, which was delivered to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators on April 13," Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of Hamas's political arm in Gaza, said in a brief statement early Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement will study this proposal, and upon completion of its study, it will submit its response."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas had previously insisted on a permanent ceasefire, something rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been unsuccessfully trying to seal a new truce deal in Gaza ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Israeli media outlets, citing unnamed officials, said Israel's war cabinet had discussed a new plan for a truce and hostage release ahead of the Egyptian delegation's visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been "noticeable progress in bringing the views of the Egyptian and Israeli delegations closer", said Al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egyptian state intelligence services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza was also on the agenda for an international summit set to kick off in Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Economic Forum special meeting, scheduled to begin in Riyadh on Sunday, will include a Gaza-focused session on Monday set to feature newly appointed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly and Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations aid coordinator for the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discussions with European, American and regional counterparts on Gaza and the regional situation are planned in Riyadh," a diplomatic source said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses in besieged Gaza reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight into Saturday around Rafah, the last urban centre Israeli ground forces have yet to enter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Plans for an Israeli incursion into the city, which military leaders say is necessary to uproot Hamas battalions, have sparked opposition among the international community due to the presence of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians seeking refuge there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told AFP on Thursday that such an operation "will undoubtedly threaten the negotiations" and show "that Israel is interested in continuing the war".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war began with the unprecedented Hamas attack on October 7, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,170 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,356 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel estimates that 129 hostages are still being held by Hamas in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead. (AFP)

    Trump lawyers cross examine ex-tabloid publisher

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A courtroom sketch depicts David Pecker being cross examined by Emil Bove during former President Donald Trump's criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence a porn star. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750763_1_L_20240427021510.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former tabloid publisher who squashed potentially embarrassing stories about Donald Trump was back on the witness stand on Friday being grilled by lawyers of the former US president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  David Pecker, 72, has testified for four days in the trial of Trump, accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter that could have derailed his 2016 White House campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker, the first witness in the blockbuster trial, has outlined under questioning from prosecutors a scheme known as "catch and kill," which involved purchasing and then burying salacious stories which could have been damaging to the real estate tycoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 77, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is accused of engaging in "election fraud" by having his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen make a US$130,000 payment to Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The high-stakes trial requires Trump to report to the drafty Manhattan courtroom multiple times a week, restricting his time on the campaign trail less than seven months before his likely election rematch with President Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters in a hallway before entering court on Friday, Trump wished his wife, Melania, a happy birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It'd be nice to be with her but I'm at a courthouse for a rigged trial," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker, whose outlets included the National Enquirer tabloid, testified this week about a hush money payment to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed to have had a year-long affair with Trump that was a precursor to the Daniels saga.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker explained how transfers to the tune of US$150,000 were made to "catch and kill" McDougal's story and suppress its publication, calling it a "large purchase" relative to the sums his company would normally pay for content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said payments to McDougal were disguised as services to American Media, the tabloid's parent company, to avoid violating campaign finance laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We purchased the story so it would not be published by any other organization," Pecker told the jury. "We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or hurt his campaign."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McDougal's story ultimately did come out, four days before the election in a scoop from The Wall Street Journal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pecker said Trump called him and was "very upset."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When it came to squashing Daniels' tale of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, Pecker said he hesitated to pay for yet another story.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not a bank," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The executive suggested to Cohen that he pay for it instead, which prosecutors say the then-Trump fixer did.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The specific charge facing Trump of falsifying business records stems from his reimbursements to Cohen for the payment to Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During defence cross-examination which began on Thursday, Emil Bove, a Trump attorney sought to ruffle Pecker by noting timeline inconsistencies, while also casting the "catch and kill" tactics described by prosecutors as "business as usual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has appeared increasingly disgruntled, angry even, as the trial proceeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He complained on Friday that the courtroom was "freezing" and that it was "on purpose I believe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

    King Charles eases back into royal duties

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British head of state King Charles III will make a limited return to public duties next week, after doctors said they were "very encouraged" by the progress of his treatment for cancer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His first engagement with Queen Camilla would be to a cancer treatment centre on Tuesday. The couple will also host Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan for a state visit in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement follows a difficult spell for the royal family after both Charles, 75, and his 42-year-old daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed that they had cancer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Catherine, the wife of heir to the throne Prince William, made the shock announcement that she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy just over a month ago in a video posted to social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Announcing Charles's limited return, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said it was "too early to say" how much longer his treatment would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they noted that his medical team were "very encouraged by the progress made so far and remain positive about the king's continued recovery".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pacing of the king's programme will be carefully calibrated as his recovery continues, in close consultation with his medical team," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The king and Queen Camilla will host the Japanese royal couple at Buckingham Palace in late June, the palace said, confirming reports in the Japanese media last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese royals both attended the state funeral of Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in September 2022, in their first overseas trip after the emperor's enthronement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also attended the reception the king hosted at Buckingham Palace the evening before the funeral for heads of state and official overseas guests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An earlier state visit which had been planned for early 2020 had to be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. (AFP)

    Biden 'happy to debate' Trump

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden has branded his Republican opponent in the presidential race as a threat to democracy. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750761_1_L_20240427014751.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden said on Friday he's ready to face off against his White House challenger Donald Trump in a debate ahead of their likely presidential rematch in November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Candidate debates have been important milestones in US presidential elections for decades, helping make or break voters' opinions of the contestants' personal style and demeanor as much as their policy chops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden's team has for months been non-committal about his willingness to participate in the tradition, which is usually held in front of an audience and moderated by a well-known journalist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy to debate him," Biden told radio host Howard Stern Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am, somewhere. I don't know when," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ok, let's set it up!" Trump campaign advisor Chis LaCivita said on X, formerly Twitter, in response to Biden's comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Presumptive Republican nominee Trump declined to face off against his primary opponents in any debates during the 2024 cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he has indicated his eagerness with the man who beat him in 2020, saying on social media earlier this year that he was ready to hold a presidential debate with Biden "ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, who has branded Trump as a threat to democracy, told reporters last month that any agreement to debate the real estate mogul "depends on his behaviour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) has already arranged three dates and locations for Trump and Biden to go head-to-head for the 2024 fight, at US universities throughout the country in September and October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Trump bashed the CPD as being biased toward Democrat Biden when in 2020 it planned to move a third and final debate to a virtual format amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then-president Trump had himself shown up to the second 2020 debate against Biden only three days before testing positive for Covid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden at the time had said he would not participate in another in-person debate with Trump while the Republican was still ill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A verbal spar could be a useful opportunity for both the 77-year-old former president and 81-year-old current president to display stamina, as Biden is still dogged by Trump's old "Sleepy Joe" nickname -- and Trump faced online teasing when he appeared to nod off during his criminal trial in New York last week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

    <![CDATA[<img alt="ByteDance has denied reports saying it had considered selling TikTok. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750683_1_L_20240426154425.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Indians began voting Friday in the second round of multi-phase national elections as polarisation grows over Prime Minister Narendra Modi whipping up an assertive brand of Hindu nationalist politics in his campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Voting opened at 7am in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But turnout in the first round of voting last week dropped nearly four points to 66 percent from the last election in 2019, with speculation in Indian media that higher-than-average temperatures were to blame.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second round of the poll -- conducted in phases to ease the immense logistical burden of staging an election in the world's most populous country -- includes districts that have this week seen temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outcome of Friday’s voting across 88 constituencies in 13 states with 160 million voters will be crucial for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it includes some of its strongholds in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls predict a win for Modi and the BJP, which is up against a broad opposition alliance led by the Indian National Congress and powerful regional parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 970 million voters will elect 543 members from a total 28 states to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered election that runs until June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The votes will be counted on June 4. (Agencies)

    Kim Jong-un inspects multiple-launch rockets

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Thursday inspected the test-firing of 240 mm multiple-launch rockets manufactured by a newly-established defence industry unit, the North's KCNA news agency reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The report did not give further details of the unit that produced the artillery. North Korea is believed to be ramping up production of artillery amid allegations by the United States and South Korea that it is supplying Russia with weapons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both countries deny the allegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The test firing showed the rockets met the required standards for flight characteristics and accuracy, KCNA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim said the 240 mm multiple launch rocket system, which incorporates new technology, will "bring about a strategic change in strengthening our military's artillery capabilities," according to KCNA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a separate report, KCNA said Kim visited the Kim Il Sung Military University, named after his grandfather and state founder, to mark the anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary army, the precursor to the country's military. (Reuters)

    Interim govt steps in to tackle Haiti crisis

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned on Thursday and a transitional council took power with the aim of returning stability to a country where gang violence has caused chaos and misery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry's former finance minister, Michel Patrick Boisvert, will be interim prime minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is an important day in the life of our dear republic, this day in effect opens a view to a solution... to the multidimensional crises the country faces," Boisvert said after the formal swearing-in of the nine-person transitional council on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top police and military officials and members of the transitional council stood behind Boisvert during the ceremony, hosted at the prime minister's office known as Villa d'Accueil, which was surrounded by military and a security detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry announced last month he would resign once the council was in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left Haiti in February to seek international help for police in their battles with armed and powerful gangs. But he was left stranded outside the country as the gangs threatened to completely take over the capital. Struggling to return, Henry announced his intended resignation. Boisvert had served as acting prime minister in Henry's absence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The transitional government's mandate runs until February 2026, by when there are slated to be elections, and cannot be renewed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the path to getting to elections was long, and there were already tensions within the council as different factions jostled for power, said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite the installation, there is still a long and rocky road ahead for the council to be able to forge a government," Da Rin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The naming of the council is also seen as key step towards the deployment of a multinational security mission. Kenya had offered to head that mission but then put it on pause as the security situation deteriorated, saying it would re-evaluate once a new government was in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the multinational force to happen quickly to help tackle the "dire" situation, his spokesperson said on Thursday. (Reuters)

    Climate change wipes 10pc off wine production

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wine producers say climate change is harming grape harvests. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750585_1_L_20240426023611.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World wine production dropped 10 percent last year, the biggest fall in more than six decades, because of "extreme" climate changes, the body that monitors the trade said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Extreme environmental conditions" including droughts, fires and other problems with climate were mostly to blame for the drastic fall, said the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) that covers nearly 50 wine producing countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia and Italy suffered the worst, with 26 and 23 percent drops. Spain lost more than a fifth of its production. Harvests in Chile and South Africa were down by more than 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The OIV said the global grape harvest was the worst since 1961, and worse even than its early estimates in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In further bad news for winemakers, customers drank three per cent less wine in 2023, the French-based intergovernmental body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director John Barker highlighted "drought, extreme heat and fires, as well as heavy rain causing flooding and fungal diseases across major northern and southern hemisphere wine producing regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although he said climate problems were not solely to blame for the drastic fall, "the most important challenge that the sector faces is climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know that the grapevine, as a long-lived plant cultivated in often vulnerable areas, is strongly affected by climate change," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France bucked the falling harvest trend, with a four percent rise, making it by far the world's biggest wine producer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine consumption last year was however at its lowest level since 1996, confirming a fall-off over the last five years, according to the figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trend is partly due to price rises caused by inflation and a sharp fall in wine drinking in China – down a quarter.

    US top court ponders 'rule for the ages' in Trump case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters outside the US Supreme Court urge the justices to reject Trump's arguments on immunity. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750582_1_L_20240426013833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court heard arguments on Thursday on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution and appeared poised to issue a ruling that could further delay Donald Trump's trial on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic case -- the last in the court's current term – has far-reaching implications for executive power and Trump's multiple legal issues as he seeks the White House again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're writing a rule for the ages," said Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of three conservative justices appointed to the nation's highest court by the former Republican president.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least four, and possibly five, of the conservative justices on the nine-member court appeared to take issue with a lower court ruling that a former president does not enjoy "absolute immunity" from criminal prosecution after leaving office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, told Michael Dreeben, representing Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the election conspiracy charges against Trump, that he had "concerns" with the lower court ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As I read it, it says simply, 'a former president can be prosecuted because he's being prosecuted,'" Roberts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why shouldn't we either send (the case) back to the Court of Appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that's not the law?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sending the case back to the lower court for further review would almost certainly delay Trump's election conspiracy trial until after the November vote, when he is expected to face off once again against Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Justice Samuel Alito, another conservative, asked why – without immunity – a president won't just "pardon themselves from anything that they might have been conceivably charged with committing?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Sauer, representing Trump, told the court that "without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution there can be no presidency as we know it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every current president will face de facto blackmail and extortion by his political rivals while he is still in office," Sauer said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Scottish Green Party will vote against Scotland's Humza Yousaf in a vote of no confidence in him as first minister, a source within the party said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yousaf's other opponents said earlier on Thursday they would seek to oust him as Scotland's leader after his Scottish National Party abandoned a coalition with the Greens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yousaf, who serves as first minister in Scotland's devolved government, ended the alliance on Thursday. The arrangement had come under strain after a decision to scrap a climate change emissions reduction target last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNP has led Scotland's devolved government since 2011, but its fortunes faltered since a funding scandal and the resignation of a party leader last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party holds broadly centre-left views, but its coalition with the Greens had highlighted splits over how progressive its pitch should be as it seeks to woo back voters on social and environmental issues beyond its core call for independence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, a YouGov poll put the main British opposition Labour Party slightly ahead of the SNP in Scotland for the first time since Scottish voters chose to remain part of the United Kingdom in an independence referendum in 2014. (Reuters)

    NY court overturns Weinstein rape conviction

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harvey Weinstein's 2020 conviction for sexual assault and rape was overturned by New York's highest court, reopening the landmark case that launched the #MeToo movement and highlighting the challenges of holding powerful men accountable.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a bitterly divided 4-3 decision on Thursday, the state Court of Appeals said the trial judge made a critical mistake by letting women testify that Weinstein assaulted them, even though their accusations were not part of the charges he faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the trial judge compounded the error by letting Weinstein be cross-examined on a broad range of "loathsome" conduct, including bullying and fits of anger toward associates, that portrayed him in a "highly prejudicial" light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behaviour that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges," Judge Jenny Rivera wrote for the majority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a prison in upstate Rome, New York.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is not expected to be freed immediately, as he also faces a separate 16-year prison term in California after being convicted there last year for the 2013 rape of an actress at a Los Angeles hotel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose predecessor Cyrus Vance brought the New York case, will decide whether to retry Weinstein.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault," Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for Bragg, said in an email. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The blades of the windmill on top of the Moulin Rouge cabaret, one of the most famous landmarks in Paris, collapsed during the night, firefighters on Thursday said, just months before the French capital hosts the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The letters M, O and U had also been toppled from the name spelled out on the building's facade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the reason for the accident was not yet known, the Moulin Rouge's director Jean-Victor Clerico said there was no sign of "foul play", adding the cause was "obviously a technical problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No-one was hurt and there was no risk of further collapse, Paris firefighters said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. The club was founded in 1889 and the audience for its dance shows is largely made up of tourist groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of thousands of people watch the cabaret's daily shows each year, with many more stopping to look from the outside at the landmark at the foot of the Montmartre hill. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Columbia University students heckled US House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as he visited the flashpoint of nationwide student demonstrations over the Israeli war in Gaza, even as the New York school agreed to 48 more hours of negotiations to end a protest encampment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Johnson's visit, which he said was meant to support Jewish students intimidated by some anti-Israeli demonstrators, took place shortly after the university extended a deadline from Wednesday morning to Friday morning to reach an agreement to remove an encampment that has come to symbolise the campus protest movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the campus protests taking place coast to coast were met with shows of force from law enforcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Texas on Wednesday, state highway patrol troopers in riot gear and police on horseback broke up a protest at the University of Texas in Austin and arrested 20 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The University of Southern California declared its campus closed and asked the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to clear a demonstration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police arrested students who peacefully surrendered one-by-one, hours after campus police who took down an encampment were overwhelmed by protesters and requested LAPD help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other demonstrations took place at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and California State Polytechnic in Humboldt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesting students have demanded universities divest assets from Israel and seek to pressure the US government to rein in Israeli strikes on Palestinian civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's fierce response followed a deadly October 7 cross-border raid by Islamist militants from Hamas, which controls the Gaza enclave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The at times vulgar heckling and booing that greeted Johnson did not drown him out, though he was hard to hear because he spoke to media microphones, not through loudspeakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Columbia has allowed these lawless radicals and agitators to take over, the virus of anti-semitism has spread across other campuses," Johnson said from the steps of the university library, calling on violent protesters to be arrested and threatening to cut off federal funding to universities that fail impose order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a politically polarised country, conservatives can score points by being seen as standing up to liberal activists, many of whom say the Republican portrayals of anti-semitic violence on campus are greatly exaggerated for political purposes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Johnson also met with Jewish students who said they were fearful to come onto the campus, citing testimony from Jewish students who said they had been spat on and seen swastikas drawn on the walls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before his press conference, Johnson met with about 40 Jewish students on campus, according to students who were there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students at the encampment say their protest has been peaceful, and that outsiders not connected with their movement are behind any inflammatory confrontations off-campus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We regret that there's no attention on this peaceful movement and politicians are diverting attention from the real issues," said Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student at Columbia who has been part of the negotiations with school administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Free speech advocates PEN America called the sudden escalation at the University of Texas "deeply alarming."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The administration should be doing everything in their power to keep their students safe and the campus operating, but calling the state police to disperse a peaceful protest that had barely begun does the opposite," Kristen Shahverdian, PEN's campus free speech program director, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The political reverberations reached the White House, where press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden believes free speech, debate and non-discrimination are important on college campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to see this be peaceful," Jean-Pierre said in Wednesday's press briefing. "It is important that students feel safe... It should not be violent, it should not be hateful rhetoric." (Reuters)

    Spanish PM ponders future as wife faces probe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Pedro Sanchez has put public duties on hold. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750424_1_L_20240425032512.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he will suspend public duties until next week to decide whether he wants to continue leading the government after a court launched a business corruption probe into his wife's private dealings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sanchez, who last year secured another term for his Socialist party as leader of a minority coalition government, said he would appear before the media on Monday, April 29 to announce his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I need to pause and think," he wrote in a letter shared on his X account. "I urgently need an answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile (...) whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock announcement came after a Spanish court said earlier on Wednesday it was launching a preliminary investigation into whether Sanchez's wife Begona Gomez committed a crime of influence peddling and corruption in business in her private dealings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez said the seriousness of the attacks against him and his wife merited a measured response. He said his wife would cooperate with the investigation and defend her innocence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court investigating Gomez did not provide further details as the case is sealed and preliminary, only saying it followed a complaint raised by anti-graft campaign group Manos Limpias – Clean Hands – whose leader has links to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Manos Limpias said Gomez used her influence as the wife of the prime minister to allegedly secure sponsors for a university master's degree course that she ran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanchez also took aim at opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo of the People's Party and Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox party, saying they had "collaborated" with those circulating the claims against his wife.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His ministers came out in support, with Energy Minister Teresa Ribera saying: "We have a first rate prime minister. Neither he nor his family deserve this." (Reuters)

    HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    First Ukraine aid to arrive in hours: Biden

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden says the aid deal sends a message to Vladimir Putin. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750417_1_L_20240425004717.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden signed a hard-fought bill into law on Wednesday that provides billions of dollars of new US aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia, notching a rare bipartisan victory for the president as he seeks reelection and ending months of wrangling with Republicans in Congress.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It gives vital support to America's partners so they can defend themselves from threats to their sovereignty," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill includes US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine and US$26 billion for Israel, as well as US$1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The impact of the legislation was immediate. Biden said he had approved an initial US$1 billion in weapons supplies for Ukraine and that the flow of these arms would start within hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The initial aid package includes vehicles, Stinger air defence munitions, additional ammunition for high-mobility artillery rocket systems, 155mm artillery ammunition, TOW and Javelin anti-tank munitions and other weapons that can immediately be put to use on the battlefield.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, a Democrat who is expected to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the November election, had pressed lawmakers for six months to approve more funding for Ukraine. Trump objected to the Ukraine aid, and some Republicans in Congress refused to back it, questioning whether Ukraine could ever prevail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden thanked House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the top Republican in Washington, for breaking the deadlock on the legislation and vowed to return soon to addressing border security, a top issue for Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together despite our differences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden blamed "MAGA Republicans" loyal to Trump for spending months blocking the aid, referring to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said passage of the legislation sends a direct message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military has been making gains in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's failed again. American stands with our friends. ... We bow to no one, no one, certainly not Vladimir Putin," he said. (Reuters)

    Boeing reports Q1 loss amid ongoing crisis

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Boeing's first quarter loss was smaller than analysts had expected. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750405_1_L_20240424220036.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Troubled aviation giant Boeing reported a first-quarter loss of US$343 million on Wednesday, reflecting recent safety troubles that have slowed production and deliveries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US plane maker said it tempered production in the 737 programme following a near-catastrophic incident on an Alaska Airlines jet in January that sparked heavy scrutiny from Washington and Boeing's airline customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-quarter loss, which was somewhat smaller than analysts expected, compared with a loss of US$414 million in the year-ago period. Revenues fell 7.5 percent to US$16.6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the loss, shares rallied after the company's CEO confirmed Boeing would meet key financial targets by the end of 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's commercial airplane business suffered an operating loss as the company pointed to unspecified "customer considerations" following a temporary grounding of the 737 MAX 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boeing's defence space and security division reported operating profitability in spite of losses on "certain fixed-price development programmes", the company said in a press release. (AP)
