<div class="itemFullText">
 Nineteen people including five children are confirmed dead after a landslide at a huge garbage dump in the Ugandan capital Kampala, a senior official said on Sunday, amid claims the site was a disaster waiting to happen.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local media said homes, people and livestock were buried in mountains of waste at the landfill in the northern Kampala district of Kiteezi on Saturday after a collapse caused by heavy downpours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Yoweri Museveni said he had directed the army's special forces to help in the search and rescue operation and demanded to know who allowed people to live near such a "potentially hazardous and dangerous heap."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The area's resident commissioner Yasin Ndide said after visiting the scene of the disaster that the death toll was now 19, including five children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rescue mission is ongoing but with little hope of finding more survivors," he said, adding that local authorities were setting up temporary shelters for those affected by the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ndide blamed the "encroachment" of local people who had breached the perimeter fence and settled on the site for the loss of life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala's metropolitan police spokesman Patrick Onyango had earlier told reporters at the scene that 14 bodies had been recovered on Saturday, and another four on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Onyango also said that 14 people had been rescued, while an estimated 1,000 were displaced and that the police were working with other government agencies and community leaders to see how to help those affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kampala mayor Erias Lukwago said that "many, many more could be still buried in the heap as the rescue operation is ongoing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described it as a "national disaster," blaming corrupt officials who he said had been syphoning off money that should have been used to maintain the landfill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Museveni said in a statement posted on X that he had ordered payments to the victims' families of five million Ugandan shillings (US$1,300) for each fatality and one million shillings (US$270) for each injured person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for an investigation into how people were allowed to live so close to the site and ordered the removal of all those living in the "danger zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Excavators were still churning through huge mounds of rubbish on Sunday as crowds of local residents looked on, some wailing in despair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lukwago had on Saturday raised concerns about the safety of the 36-acre (14-hectare) landfill which was established in 1996 and takes in almost all garbage collected across Kampala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a disaster and was bound to happen as the landfill was full to capacity," he said, adding that it received about 1,500 tonnes of waste a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In January, Lukwago had warned that people working and living near the site were at risk of numerous health hazards due to overflowing waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several areas in Uganda and other parts of East Africa have been battered by heavy rains recently, including Ethiopia, the second most populous country on the continent. (AFP)

    Hamas tells Gaza mediators to go with Biden truce plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People inspect the damage in Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood after it was destroyed by Israeli bombs on Sunday. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765795_1_20240812034601.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday called on US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators to implement a ceasefire plan for Gaza put forward by US President Joe Biden, instead of holding "more negotiations."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas "demands that the mediators present a plan to implement what they proposed to the movement... based on Biden's vision and the UN Security Council resolution, and compel the occupation (Israel) to comply, rather than going through more negotiation rounds or new proposals," the Palestinian group said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mediators have invited both Israel and Hamas for a round of negotiations on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, shortly after the killing of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Israel agreed to a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks to facilitate the release of hostages still held in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran and Hamas have blamed Israel for the killing of Haniyeh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several rounds of negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza have failed until now, except for a one-week truce that was observed at the end of November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That truce saw the release of scores of hostages in exchange of dozens of Palestinians prisoners who were held in Israeli jails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On May 31, Biden unveiled what he said was a three-stage plan for a ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plan includes a "full and complete ceasefire" lasting six weeks, with Israeli forces withdrawing from "all populated areas of Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "a number" of hostages captured in the October 7 attacks, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The remains of some hostages who had been killed would also be returned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their "homes and neighbourhoods" throughout Gaza, including in the north, which has been devastated by months of Israeli bombing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the initial six-week period, Israel and Hamas would "negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceasefire would also be extended if the negotiations continue, with mediators working to ensure they continue, Biden said at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In phase two, also lasting around another six weeks, Israeli forces would completely withdraw from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas would release "all remaining living hostages" including male Israeli soldiers. This has been a key sticking point for Hamas in the past.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If both sides keep to the deal it will lead to the "cessation of hostilities permanently," Biden said, quoting what he said had been an Israeli proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the third and final stage, a major reconstruction and stabilisation plan for Gaza would begin, backed by the US and the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 Hamas attacks resulted in the deaths of 1,198 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 39 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 39,790 people, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory, which does not provide details on civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    Russia concedes Ukraine advances in Kursk offensive

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Ukrainian missile was blamed for this fire at a residential building in Kursk. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765791_1_20240812023140.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday acknowledged Ukrainian forces had pierced deep into the Kursk border region in an offensive that a top official in Ukraine said was aimed to "destabilise" Russia and "stretch" its armed forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyiv has deployed thousands of troops to the surprise operation, a Ukrainian security official said, seizing the battlefield initiative after months of slow Russian advances across the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are on the offensive. The aim is to stretch the positions of the enemy, to inflict maximum losses and to destabilise the situation in Russia as they are unable to protect their own border," the security official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shock assault, now in its sixth day, appeared to catch the Kremlin off guard, with Moscow's army rushing in reserve troops, tanks, aviation, artillery and drones in a bid to quash the incursion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it's army on Sunday appeared to concede that Ukraine had been able to penetrate its territory by up to 30 kilometres in places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a daily briefing on the situation in the western Kursk region, the defence ministry said it had "foiled attempts" by Ukraine's forces to "break through deep into Russian territory" using armoured vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said some of those forces were located near the villages of Tolpino and Obshchy Kolodez, which are around 25 km and 30 km from the Russia-Ukraine border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian official also said Russia's claims that Kyiv had deployed 1,000 troops were a serious underestimation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a lot more... Thousands," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After days of official silence, President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged the offensive for the first time in his nightly address on Saturday, saying that Kyiv was "pushing the war into the aggressor's territory."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia assaulted Ukraine in February 2022 and has waged an unrelenting campaign, occupying swathes of the east and south and subjecting Ukrainian cities to daily missile and drone attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After re-capturing large areas in 2022, Kyiv has largely been on the back foot, increasingly struggling with manpower and arms supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The assault on Russia's western Kursk region has been the largest and most successful cross-border offensive by Kyiv so far – and the most significant attack by a foreign army on Russian territory since the Second World War.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia has used air power, artillery fire and drones in a bid to quash the advance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said on Saturday that more than 76,000 civilians had been evacuated from border areas, with more leaving on Sunday. (AFP)

    Two migrants die trying to cross Channel to Britain

    <![CDATA[<img alt="So far this year 25 migrants have died trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765786_1_20240812001833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two migrants died on Sunday in the Channel off the northern coast of France trying to reach Britain by boat, French maritime authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new drownings near the French city of Calais mean nine people have lost their life attempting the dangerous sea crossing this month alone, and 25 since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boat was signalled as being in distress on Sunday morning at sea between Calais and Dunkirk and "two people were declared dead," the maritime authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vessel in trouble 10 kilometres north of Calais had 56 migrants on board, said Jacques Billant, prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the 54 surviving passengers, and another 50 people from another boat who were rescued, five were receiving medical care, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2023, 12 migrants had died at sea trying to reach what they hoped would be a better life in Britain, according to the French authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death toll this year has already surpassed that, with 25 migrants who have lost their lives since January, Billant said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said those crossing the sea often did so "without a lifejacket," on "vessels of very poor quality because not inflated enough and often without a solid bottom... or decent engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A non-governmental organisation called L'Auberge des Migrants ("The migrant hostel") on X mourned the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This border kills in the greatest of silences," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of August 8, 17,639 people had crossed the sea on so-called "small boats" to Britain this year, according to a tally of British government figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That is very close to the figure for the same period in 2022, a year of record crossings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the Labour party's victory in the British general election in July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged to strengthen "cooperation" in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has cancelled a plan by the former Conservative government to send irregular migrants to a holding camp in Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, both governments are seeking to crack down on the people-smuggling gangs who organise the crossings and are paid thousands of euros by each migrant for the risky trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Billant said more than 350 people have been arrested and 15 "smuggler networks" dismantled since the start of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new migrant deaths come as the United Kingdom has been rocked by anti-migrant unrest, following a knife attack on July 29 that killed three children and was falsely linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the United Kingdom on Saturday against the riots that targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration. (AFP)

    In TV interview, Biden brands Trump a 'danger' to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US President Joe Biden made the claim in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765781_1_20240811234132.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden, in his first TV interview since dropping out of the White House race, warned that Republican candidate Donald Trump was "a genuine danger to American security."
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Mark my words, if he wins... this election, watch what happens," Biden told CBS News in a pre-taped interview broadcast on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's a genuine danger to American security. Look, we're at an inflection point in world history... and democracy is the key."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, 81, has kept a low profile since withdrawing after his flailing debate performance against Trump underlined fears about his age and mental abilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the short TV interview, recorded in the White House last week, he appeared frail but cogent, again admitting he failed in the debate but stressing that health-wise he has "no serious problem."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining his exit, he said other Democratic Party politicians standing for re-election feared he would damage their chances – and added that his only priority was to stop Trump from returning to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the (election) races," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A critical issue for me still is – not a joke – maintaining this democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have an obligation to the country to do what is the most important thing we can do, and that is – we must, we must, we must defeat Trump."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was proud of his record on jobs, investment and Covid recovery – and vowed to campaign hard for Vice President Kamala Harris, who has replaced him on the ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to do whatever Kamala thinks I can do to help most," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's age had come to dominate the 2024 campaign, and the Democrats' hopes of winning have soared since his exit, as Harris has enjoyed a surge in support that has left Trump struggling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outgoing president said he had expected to serve only one term when he won in 2020, but that he had been persuaded to stay on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought of myself as being a transition president. I can't even say how old I am. It's hard for me to get it out of my mouth, but things got moving so quickly, it didn't happen," he told CBS's Robert Costa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's light campaign schedule has come under scrutiny, and it was his running mate, JD Vance, who blitzed the Sunday morning political talk shows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing on CNN, ABC and CBS, Vance fielded questions about white supremacist attacks on his family, child care, asylum seekers and abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one testy exchange with CBS's Margaret Brennan, Vance complained that she had asked "six questions about abortion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm still trying to get a clear answer," Brennan retorted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also claimed that Harris was the one "calling the shots" in the Biden administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If she's not calling the shots, Dana, who is?" he told CNN's Dana Bash. (AFP)

    Australian government urged to ban gambling ads

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs. Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765725_1_20240811154222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An alliance of leading Australians has demanded the government impose a total ban on gambling ads in a country that racks up some of the biggest losses per person in the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gambling losses in Australia, with a population of just 27 million, are estimated at A$25 billion a year (US$16 billion).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adverts enticing people to risk their cash are widespread on television, radio and billboards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slot machines known as "pokies" are installed in many pubs, too, drawing more to part with their money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Gambling advertising in Australia is out of control with one million gambling ads being aired on free-to-air television and radio in just one year," said a letter signed by more than 60 prominent Australians to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the opposition leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the letter released at the weekend included former political, union, sports and faith leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They urged Albanese's Labor government and the conservative opposition to agree to outlaw all gambling advertising within three years, in line with the recommendations of a 2023 report into gambling harm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many Australians are alarmed about the proliferation of gambling advertising on our screens and the mounting losses through gambling," said former prime minister John Howard, who was among the signatories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe gambling losses are responsible for enormous harm throughout the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Studies cited by the government put Australian gambling losses at A$25 billion a year, representing a global record per capita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even during a period of Covid-19 measures that closed many pubs, clubs and casinos in the 2020-2021 financial year, Australian state government statistics showed gambling losses exceeded A$24 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total ban on all gambling advertising is essential to stop gambling companies targeting our children," said Alliance for Gambling Reform chief executive Martin Thomas.

  "Any decision to simply cap advertising, or limit a blanket ban to only social media, would be a win for vested interests and leave Australians exposed to significant harm," Thomas said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides the financial losses, the cost of inaction would be "mounting financial ruin, mental health problems, suicide, and the family violence that gambling can exacerbate", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Nine Entertainment newspapers have said the government is expected to announce proposed legislation within weeks, possibly opting for limits instead of a total advertising ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese said last week his government had engaged with "stakeholders" and was committed to "minimising gambling harm" but declined to say whether an advertising ban was envisaged. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Indian soldiers were killed in clashes in Kashmir, the military said early on Sunday, after security forces exchanged fire with militants in the disputed territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kashmir, particularly its southern Hindu-majority region Jammu, has seen a string of battles with insurgents in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army wrote on social media that two soldiers had "laid down their lives in the line of duty" in Anantnag district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army and police had clashed with militants after launching an operation in the area, according to a social media post by the local military unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinar Corps said on X that two civilians were also injured "due to indiscriminate, desperate and reckless firing by terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Muslim-majority Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence from British rule in 1947, and each side claims it in full.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebel groups have waged an insurgency since 1989, demanding independence or merger with Pakistan, in fighting that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, soldiers and rebels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Delhi and Islamabad accuse each other of stoking militancy and espionage to undermine each other, and the nuclear-armed rivals have fought multiple conflicts for control of the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, at least 11 Indian soldiers were killed in Kashmir following a spate of militant attacks. (AFP)

    New polls give Harris a lead over Trump in key states

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Voters polled in Pennsylvania said they saw Kamala Harris as more intelligent than Donald Trump and having a better temperament to govern. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765677_1_20240811002507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in three crucial battleground states, according to new polls published on Saturday, apparently eroding the advantage the former president has enjoyed there over the past year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The polls of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College showed Harris leading Trump by an identical 50 percent to 46 percent margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the US electoral college voting system, those three populous Midwestern states are considered key to victory for either party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The polls are a reversal of surveys in those states which for nearly a year had shown Trump either tied with or slightly leading Democratic President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race last month and endorsed Harris instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Much can change in the nearly three months before the November 5 election. The polling showed voters still prefer Trump on the key issues of the economy and immigration, though Harris had a 24-point advantage when voters were asked whom they trust on the issue of abortion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democrats, in any case, have taken heart in the surge of enthusiasm that has greeted Harris's candidacy, with many expressing relief after 81-year-old Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her announcement on Tuesday of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate also appears to have energised Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris-Walz surge helped cut short a rise in support for Trump that followed the July 13 attempt on his life and the Republicans' successful national convention last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Harris has enjoyed an even bigger bump in favourability – up 10 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania in just a month, the Times/Siena polling found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voters said they saw her as more intelligent than Trump and having a better temperament to govern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, his running mate JD Vance and other Republicans have tried an array of attacks meant to weaken Harris – with Trump even questioning her racial identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the new polls show Democrats strongly supporting the younger and more vigorous Harris who, with Walz, has been campaigning at a furious pace this week in swing states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among Democrats, voter satisfaction with their choice of candidates has shot up by 27 points in the three Midwestern states since May, the polls found.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three months ago, it was Republicans who expressed a higher level of satisfaction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The surveys were conducted between August 5 and 9, with at least 600 voters in each state. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In London, hundreds massed outside the office of Brexit architect Nigel Farage's Reform UK party before marching to parliament, as a large police presence looked on. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765674_1_20240810233126.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators rallied across the UK on Saturday to protest recent rioting blamed on the far-right in the wake of the Southport knife attack that killed three children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Crowds massed in London, Glasgow, Belfast, Manchester and numerous other English towns and cities, as fears of violent confrontations with anti-immigration agitators failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It followed a similar situation unfolding on Wednesday night, when anticipated far-right rallies up and down the country were instead replaced by gatherings organised by the Stand Up To Racism advocacy group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen places across England as well as Belfast had been hit by unrest prior to that, following the July 29 stabbing spree, which was wrongly linked on social media to a Muslim immigrant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioters targeted mosques and hotels linked to immigration, as well as police, vehicles and other sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, recent nights have been largely peaceful in English towns and cities, prompting hope among authorities that the more than 700 arrests and numerous people already being jailed has deterred further violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, in Northern Ireland, which has seen sustained disorder since last weekend, police said they were investigating a suspected racially motivated hate crime overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A petrol bomb was thrown at a mosque in Newtownards, east of Belfast, in the early hours of Saturday, with graffiti sprayed on the front door and walls of the building, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the petrol bomb thrown at the property did not ignite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is being treated as a racially motivated hate crime, and I want to send a strong message to those who carried this out, that this type of activity will not be tolerated and any reports of hate crime are taken very seriously," PSNI Chief Inspector Keith Hutchinson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was also overnight reports of damage to property and vehicles in Belfast, as nightly unrest there rumbled on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disturbances in Northern Ireland were sparked by events in England but have also been fuelled by pro-UK loyalist paramilitaries with their own agenda, according to the PSNI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 5,000 anti-racism demonstrators rallied in Belfast on Saturday without incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In London, hundreds massed outside the office of Brexit architect Nigel Farage's Reform UK party before marching to parliament, as a large police presence looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Farage and other far-right figures have been blamed for helping to fuel the riots through anti-immigrant rhetoric and conspiracy theories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really important for people of colour in this country, for immigrants in this country, to see us out here as white British people saying 'no, we don't stand for this'," said attendee Phoebe Sewell, 32, from London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow Londoner Jeremy Snelling, 64, said he had turned out because "I don't like the right-wing claiming the streets in my name."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not hold Farage "personally responsible" for the violence but argued that the Reform party founder had "contributed" to the volatile environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think he is damaging and I think he's dangerous," Snelling added. (AFP)

    LA planning 'No Car' Olympics to beat gridlock

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said 2028 chiefs want the LA Olympics to be "The No Car Games" by investing in public transportation. File photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765668_1_20240810223516.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles 2028 organisers said on Saturday they will force spectators to take public transportation to Olympic venues and encourage remote working in a bid to sidestep the gridlocked city's notorious traffic problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said 2028 chiefs want the LA Olympics to be "The No Car Games" by investing in public transportation and encouraging Angelenos to adopt pandemic-style remote-working for the duration of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 'No Car Games' means that you will have to take public transportation to get to all of the venues," Bass told a press conference ahead of Sunday's Paris Olympics closing ceremony. "In order to do that we have been building out our transportation system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan would require borrowing more than 3,000 buses from other parts of the United States, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass was adamant however that Los Angeles's traffic, where rush hour congestion can lead to car journeys of just a few miles taking an hour or more, would not be a problem, citing the history of the 1984 Olympics in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 1984 Angelenos were terrified that we were going to have terrible, terrible traffic," she said. "And we were shocked that we didn't. And in 1984 we didn't have any of the technology that we do today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that city officials 40 years ago encouraged employers to stagger shifts or allowed workers to work remotely to great success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we can do that again," Bass said. "So part of having a no-car Olympics means getting people not to drive, but also using public transportation to get to the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We certainly learned from Covid that you have essential workers, people that must come to work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if you limit it to that, it's going to be a lot easier because we did go through Covid. So people will have some reference point in recent history as to how you can do that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bass said the city would also aim to house Los Angeles's estimated 75,500 homeless population before the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if Los Angeles would follow Paris' example by moving several thousand homeless people in the build-up to the Olympics to locations outside the city, Bass replied: "We are going to get Angelenos housed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is what we have been doing and we're going to continue to do that. We will get people housed, we will get them off the street." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopian Tamirat Tola delivered a masterclass in solo front running to win the Olympic men's marathon in Paris on Saturday as Eliud Kipchoge's bid for a third gold went up in smoke.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tola clocked an Olympic record of two hours  six minutes and 26 seconds for victory, finishing 21 seconds ahead of Belgium's Bashir Abdi, whose silver marked an upgrade from his bronze garnered at the Covid-hit Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's Benson Kipruto, winner of Tokyo, Boston and Chicago marathons in recent years, rounded out the podium, a further 13 seconds adrift.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you, Paris!" said Tola, the 2016 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist who will be 33 on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy today, I was 2022 world champion and now I'm Olympic champion. It's the greatest day in my life. This was my goal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team fielded three long-distance runners in the event, with Wu Xiangdong finishing 40th with a time of two hours, 12 minutes and 34 seconds. Yang Shaohui came in 55th with a time of two hours, 14 minutes and 48 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s third runner, He Jie, needed two hours 22 minutes and 31 seconds to finish the race, finishing 67th.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 42km-long marathon course headed out of central Paris on a loop to Versailles.
  <br/>
  The route included a 436m climb and 438m descent. The maximum gradient on the route was 13.5 percent. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Gaza civil defence says 93 dead in Israeli strike

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Displaced Palestinians gather in the yard of a school hit by an Israeli strike in Gaza City. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765635_1_20240810170902.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced Palestinians killed 93 people, as Israel's military accused militants of using the building as a command centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas denounced the "dangerous escalation" in north Gaza, which came after international mediators invited the warring sides to resume next Thursday talks towards a long-sought ceasefire and hostage-release deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan's foreign ministry said the timing of the school strike "is an indication of the Israeli government's efforts to obstruct and thwart these efforts".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil defence in the Hamas-ruled territory said three Israeli missiles hit the school in Gaza City while people performed dawn prayers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their bodies were torn apart," civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. "It reminds us of the first days of the war in the Gaza Strip."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced during the war started by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings, which have been hit at least 14 times since July 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's army said on Saturday it had "precisely struck Hamas terrorists operating within a Hamas command and control centre embedded in the Al-Tabieen school".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military has repeatedly made similar accusations after strikes on the school shelters. Hamas has previously denied Israeli claims that it uses schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities for military aims. (AFP)

    Regional plane crashes in Brazil killing 61

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The plane crashed in the town of Vinhedo, near Sao Paulo. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765594_1_20240810084017.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A regional turboprop plane crashed near Sao Paulo in Brazil on Friday, killing all 61 people on board, the airline said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Regional carrier Voepass said the plane, bound for Sao Paulo's international airport, took off from Cascavel, in the state of Parana, and crashed at around 1.30 pm in the town of Vinhedo, some 80 km northwest of Sao Paulo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video shared on social media showed the ATR-72 aircraft spinning out of control as it plunged down behind a cluster of trees near houses, followed by a large plume of black smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearby resident Daniel de Lima said he heard a loud noise before looking outside his condominium in Vinhedo when he saw the plane in a horizontal spiral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was rotating, but it wasn't moving forward," he told Reuters. "Soon after it fell out of the sky and exploded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  City officials at Valinhos, near Vinhedo, said there were no survivors and only one home in the local condominium complex had been damaged while none of the residents were hurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I almost believe the pilot tried to avoid a nearby neighbourhood, which is densely populated," de Lima said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not immediately say what had caused the crash, though the head of Brazilian aviation accident investigation centre Cenipa said that the plane's so-called "black box" containing voice recordings and flight data had been recovered from the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video of the crash showed clear weather, with the forecast for the area calling for light rainfall and winds of 10 km per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Hansman, a professor in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reviewed some of the footage shared on social media and without having reviewed flight data said the crash did not appear to have been caused by weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It may have been an engine failure on one side that was mismanaged by the crew," he said. "It could be the thrust of the remaining engine that started the rotation downward."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US aviation safety consultant and former commercial pilot John Cox said he would want to validate the Flightradar data, which showed a lot of gyrations in speed, but regardless, something "really significant" happened to cause the plane to spin when it came down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't spin airliners," Cox said. "So that says at some point it stalled and then the flight crew lost control of it. But it appears that there may have been some catastrophic event before that loss of control."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cenipa head Marcelo Moreno cautioned in a press conference that it was still too early to determine the cause of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From what we can tell so far, the aircraft did not reach out to traffic control reporting an emergency," Moreno said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voepass, Brazil's fourth-largest airline by market share, said it could not provide any additional information on what caused the plane to crash. It had originally reported 62 people aboard the aircraft, though local media interviewed a man who said he had missed the flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In total, the plane was carrying 57 passengers and four crew, Voepass said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Franco-Italian ATR, jointly owned by Airbus and Leonardo, is the dominant producer of regional turboprop planes seating 40 to 70 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ATR told Reuters that its specialists were "fully engaged" with the investigation into the crash and its customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The motor on the plane was a PW 127 produced by Pratt & Whitney Canada, its parent company RTX Corp confirmed to Reuters. RTX said that it had offered assistance in the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both French and Canadian investigators will participate in the investigation, Moreno said. Europe's safety regulator also said it would offer technical assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crash is Brazil's deadliest since 199 people were killed in 2007 on a flight operated by TAM, which later joined LAN to become what is now LATAM Airlines. (Reuters)

    Philippine court allows Rappler to keep operating

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Philippine news site co-founded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa can continue operating after a court overturned a shutdown order, according to the ruling released on Friday, in the latest legal victory for the media outfit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ressa and Rappler have been fighting multiple court cases filed during former president Rodrigo Duterte's administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, was a vocal critic of Duterte and the deadly drug war he launched in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That triggered what media advocates say was a grinding series of criminal charges, probes and online attacks against her and Rappler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeals decision, issued on July 23 but only released to the media on Friday, reversed a previous ruling by the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that had ordered the shutdown of Rappler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SEC order had been a "grave abuse of discretion" and contravened "established procedures, jurisprudential and legal instructions, and clear intent of the Constitution", the court said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SEC shutdown order was issued on June 28, 2022, days before Duterte left office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It revoked Rappler's "certificate of incorporation" for violating constitutional and statutory restrictions on foreign ownership in mass media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rappler has continued operating as it appealed the SEC order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the constitution, investment in media is reserved for Filipinos or Filipino-controlled entities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case sprang from the 2015 investment from the US-based Omidyar Network, which was established by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Omidyar later transferred its investment in Rappler to the site's local managers to stave off efforts by Duterte to shut it down. (AFP)

 We've heard a lot over the past two weeks about athletes battling it out for the gold medal at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  What about ordinary people like you and I?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While our gold medal moments may not involve winning a place on the podium, we've all experienced things in life that made us incredibly happy or proud.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Taylor Swift fans make heart shapes with their hands following the cancellation of three concerts at Vienna's Happel stadium after the government confirmed that an attack was planned at the venue.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 19-year-old Islamic State sympathiser planned a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, the country's intelligence agency said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Austrian authorities detained two suspects on Wednesday for allegedly plotting to attack one of three Vienna concerts by the US star due to start Thursday. All were cancelled at the last minute leaving disconsolate "Swifties" to gather in the Austrian capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old main suspect had confessed, saying he "intended to carry out an attack using explosives and knives," domestic intelligence agency (DSN) head Omar Haijawi-Pirchner told a news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His aim was to kill himself and a large number of people during the concert, either today or tomorrow," he added. The concerts were to run from Thursday to Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian, was employed at a facility management company which would have "provided services" at the Ernst Happel Stadium where Swift was to perform, said Haijawi-Pirchner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The younger suspect, who has so far refused to talk to authorities, was "in the area" of the stadium when he was detained, said Haijawi-Pirchner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chancellor Karl Nehammer said there were "concrete and detailed" plans to commit a "blood bath".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Interior Minister Gerhard Karner, a "tragedy was averted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation was very serious", he added, particularly in view of a recent attack at a Taylor Swift themed event in Britain, where three girls were killed in Great Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explosives and detonators were found in a search of the main suspect's apartment, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Austria's top security chief Franz Ruf told reporters the two suspects had recently made changes in their private lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main suspect, an Austrian with Northern Macedonian roots, had changed "his appearance and adapted it to Islamic State propaganda", while the second, an Austrian of Turkish or Croatian origin, had broken up with his girlfriend, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruf earlier confirmed that authorities had received information "from foreign partners" which led to the arrests, but he declined to specify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had promised to ramp up security for the concerts while having minimised any concrete danger, but organisers still cancelled Swift's shows. About 65,000 people were expected at each show.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift's fans gathered in parks and plazas across Vienna to share their disappointment. Dilyara Joldassova, a 23-year-old engineer who travelled from Kazakhstan for the show, said she was "broken-hearted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swift did not immediately comment on the decision to cancel the Vienna shows but after the British attack said she was "completely in shock".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three girls were killed and five people seriously wounded in the mass stabbing at a dance class in Southport inspired by the American singer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Ruf, police "did everything humanly possible to ensure" that the Vienna concerts "could go ahead", but the cancellation decision was taken by the organisers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old star was to bring her record-breaking "Eras" Tour, which began its European leg in Paris in May, to Vienna on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following France, the tour stopped in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Poland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the end of last year, "Eras" had already become the first tour to sell more than US$1 billion in tickets and it's on track to more than double that by the time it concludes in Vancouver in December. (AFP)

    Gone in 60 seconds... new Banksy work disappears

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new Banksy artwork depicting a wolf on a satellite dish in London was removed, possibly stolen, less than an hour after it was unveiled by the elusive street artist on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The piece was the fourth animal-themed artwork that Banksy had installed in various parts of the UK capital this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The street artist, whose identity is unknown and the subject of feverish speculation, confirmed on Instagram that the works were his own.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The wolf silhouette was located on the roof of an empty shop in Peckham, southeast London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Photos from the scene carried by local media show a person climbing up a ladder to retrieve the satellite dish while another holds the ladder for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further images show an individual in shorts walking off with the piece of art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were called to reports of a stolen satellite dish containing artwork at 1:52 pm (12:52 GMT) on Thursday, 8 August in Rye Lane, Peckham," London's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There have been no arrests. Inquiries continue."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, a Banksy of a goat precariously perched on top of a wall with rocks tumbling down appeared in Richmond, southwest London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then on Tuesday two elephant silhouettes with their trunks stretched towards each other appeared in Fulham, southwest London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the black silhouette of three monkeys appeared on the side of a railway bridge as if they were swinging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several months usually pass between new Banksy artworks and this week's sudden spurt has sparked speculation among fans about their meaning. (AFP)

    Thousands join protests against racism in UK

    <![CDATA[<img alt="There were anti-racism rallies in English cities including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=50&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765272_1_20240808110122.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets in several English cities on Wednesday to oppose days of far-right violence that have had UK police on high alert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nightly riots -- during which mosques and migrant-related facilities have been attacked -- have erupted across towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland fuelled by a wave of misinformation surrounding the murder of three children on July 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on Wednesday evening, it was anti-racism and anti-fascist counter-protesters who were out in greater numbers, holding rallies in cities up and down England including London, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whose streets? Our streets!" chanted protesters at a few-thousand-strong gathering in Walthamstow, northeast London, where some held banners saying "Stop the far right".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I live in the borough and we don't want these people on our streets... they don't represent us," Sara Tresilian, 58, told AFP, referring to the far-right.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You have to turn out (and) give that message... I think it's important that you show up for your friends and neighbours."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andy Valentine, the Met Police's deputy assistant commissioner, thanked "communities for coming together across the capital and for showing community spirit this evening".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sheffield, activists chanted "Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here," as riot police looked on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Birmingham, hundreds of anti-racism protesters gathered outside a migrant support centre, while in Brighton, around 2,000 people took part in a peaceful demonstration, according to police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was some friction, however, as in the southern town of Aldershot, where the PA reported police had to intervene between anti-racism activists and a group of people shouting "Stop the boats" -- a reference to migrants who reach Britain by crossing the English Channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had put 6,000 specialist police on standby to deal with the approximately 100 demonstrations by far-right activists and counter-protesters that were advertised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a social media post, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper thanked "all the police officers working tonight to protect & support local communities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Courts have started to order jail terms for offenders tied to the unrest as authorities seek to head off new troubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disorder, Britain's worst since the 2011 London riots, has seen almost 430 people arrested and at least 120 charged, and has led several countries to issue travel warnings for the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence broke out after three girls aged nine, seven and six were killed and five more children critically injured during a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, northwest England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  False rumours initially spread on social media saying the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. The suspect was later identified as 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana, born in Wales. UK media reported that his parents are from Rwanda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rioting that followed has seen demonstrators throw bricks and flares at police officers, burn cars, and attack mosques and at least two hotels that have been used for asylum seekers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned anyone involved will face "the full force of the law", including those inciting violence online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer, a former chief state prosecutor, has pledged "substantive sentencing before the end of this week" for rioters, and his government has freed up an extra 500 prison places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scores of accused, including teenagers, have already appeared before judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, a man was jailed for three years after he pleaded guilty to violent disorder and assaulting a police officer in Southport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other men received sentences of 20 months and 30 months for participating in violence in Liverpool on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three men sentenced today are the tip of the iceberg, and just the start of what will be a very painful process for many who foolishly chose to involve themselves in violent unrest," said prosecutor Jonathan Egan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have blamed the disorder on figures associated with the now-defunct English Defence League (EDL), a far-right Islamophobic organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EDL founder Tommy Robinson has been accused by authorities of stoking tensions, and police in Cyprus, where he was reported to be on holiday, said on Wednesday they were ready to assist UK police if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Robinson later wrote on the X social media platform: "Lucky I'm not in Cyprus then".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  UK lawmakers have accused social media sites of fuelling the violence. Tech billionaire and X owner Elon Musk in particular has angered the government with a series of provocative tweets, including that a British "civil war is inevitable". (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Texas man was executed on Wednesday for the 1997 murder of a woman who was jogging in her Houston neighbourhood, one of two executions scheduled this week in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Arthur Lee Burton, 54, was put to death via lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, and pronounced dead at 6:47 pm Central time, officials from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the western state of Utah is scheduled to carry out an execution overnight, its first in 14 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taberon Honie, 48, is to be put to death shortly after midnight Mountain Time (0600 GMT Thursday) for the 1998 murder and sexual assault of his ex-girlfriend's mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Honie is to be executed by lethal injection at the Utah State Correctional Facility in Salt Lake City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Utah's last execution was carried out by firing squad in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burton, the death row inmate in Texas, was convicted of the July 1997 murder of Nancy Adleman, a mother of three who was attacked while out jogging. Adleman was strangled with her own shoelaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Burton's lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court to stay his execution but the request was denied without comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His attorneys had argued that Burton should be constitutionally exempt from being put to death because he is intellectually disabled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To all the people I have hurt and caused pain, I wish we didn't have to be here at this moment, but I want you to know that I am sorry for putting y'all through this," Burton said in his final statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Including Burton, Texas has carried out three executions since January and there have been 11 in the United States this year so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The death penalty has been abolished in 23 US states, while six others (Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee) have moratoriums in place. (AFP)

    Harris picks 'real deal' governor Walz as running mate

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris said on Tuesday she was "proud" to tap Tim Walz as her running mate, opting for the Minnesota governor with blue-collar credentials as the partner most likely to boost her historic White House bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Walz had been on a vice-presidential shortlist with a string of other Democratic figures seen as broadening Harris's appeal as she sprints into the contest against Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aiming to make history as the first woman US president, Harris, already a trailblazer as the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president, has little time before Election Day on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am proud to announce that I've asked Tim Walz to be my running mate," she posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his. It's great to have him on the team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden quickly expressed support for his deputy's "great decision" to choose Walz, saying the duo "will be a powerful voice for working people and America's great middle class."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Expectations had always been that Harris would pick a white man to balance the ticket and help win over working-class, white, male voters, a demographic that propelled Trump to victory in 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy manner, decades of military experience and a rural perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He dismisses the "nonsense" of Trump and Republican running mate J.D. Vance, and he is also a gun-owner who tweets about hunting, goes ice-fishing and rides rollercoasters with his daughter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The onetime teacher and school sports coach flipped a Republican district in 2006 to win a seat in the House of Representatives in a state seen as light years from the coastal elites of California, Harris's home turf, or the East Coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same time, Walz will appeal to the left for championing cannabis legalization, worker protections, abortion rights, and tighter firearm restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's campaign branded the Minnesotan as a "dangerously liberal extremist" seeking to impose California values on the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic grandee Nancy Pelosi swatted such criticism aside, telling MSNBC that Walz "is right down the middle. He's a heartland of America Democrat."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walz earned enthusiastic endorsements from Democratic liberals as well as centrists like Senator Joe Manchin, who called him "the real deal." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Somalis joined a demonstration on Monday against the jihadist group Al-Shabaab at the site of a deadly beachfront attack in the capital Mogadishu last week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A suicide bomber and gunmen attacked the popular Lido Beach on Friday evening, killing 37 people and wounding scores more, in one of the deadliest strikes in the East African country in months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We came here to Lido Beach to show we can't be intimidated," said one of the protesters, Abdisalam Ahmed Abdullahi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mogadishu people are not afraid of Kharijite enemy," he said, using a government term for the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants who have carried out numerous attacks in the predominantly Muslim country for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Survivors of Friday's assault described how following an explosion, gunmen stormed onto the beach intending to "kill everyone they could," with graphic video shared online showing bloodied bodies on the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Shabaab has been waging a bloody insurgency against Somalia's fragile federal government for more than 17 years and has previously targeted the Lido beach area, which is popular with business people and government members as well as ordinary Somalis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Somali people in general, and those in Mogadishu particularly, need to unite in fighting against the enemy," said Livestock Minister Hassan Hussein, one of several government officials who joined the rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He described Al-Shabaab militants as "bedbugs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amina Ibrahim Halane said she joined the rally to show sympathy for the victims of Friday's attack, saying they were simply "innocent men... enjoying their city." (AFP)

    Debby blows US$1mn in cocaine onto Florida beach

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hurricane Debby landed in Florida on Monday bringing high winds, pouring rain – and 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than US$1 million.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Debby, which hit the state's northern Big Bend region as a Category One hurricane but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, washed the trove of drugs ashore along Florida's southernmost tip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hurricane Debby blew 25 packages of cocaine onto a beach in the Florida Keys," US Border Patrol acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II wrote on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The load of drugs, which Briggs reported was valued at more than US$1 million, was discovered by a good Samaritan who contacted the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July of 2023, the mayor of Tampa, Florida similarly discovered 31.7 kilogrammes of cocaine that had been washed ashore in the Florida Keys, while enjoying a vacation day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to bringing cocaine, Debby has killed one person, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people, and could produce life-threatening storm surges as well as catastrophic flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Keys, a string of islands stretching off the state's southern tip, are located in close proximity to a number of Caribbean countries that serve as a transit hub for cocaine being trafficked from South America to Europe and North America, including into Florida. (AFP)

    Gaza officials bury 80 corpses handed over by Israel
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764883_1_20240805233236.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's Civil Defence agency said it received the bodies of 80 unidentified Palestinians from Israel on Monday, which it buried in a mass grave.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We received 80 bodies inside 15 bags, with more than four martyrs in each bag, each wrapped in a single shroud", said Civil Defence director Yamen Abu Suleiman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Abu Suleiman said Israeli authorities did not provide any information about the bodies, including their names or where they were found or taken from.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not know if they are martyrs (killed in Gaza) or prisoners from (Israel's) jails," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a video released by the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, men in hazmat suits could be seen inspecting the corpses, before unloading them from the shipping container they had arrived in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The footage then showed the bodies being laid in a line for burial in a mass grave dug in the sand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were later buried at the Turkish cemetery, near Khan Younis, the main city in the southern part of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Salwa Karaz, a displaced woman from Gaza City in the north, said that she had gone to the Turkish cemetery hoping to find her 32-year-old son Marwan, who went missing in January. He left behind an eight-month-old son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we learned that 80 bodies had been handed over, we came to search in hopes of finding him among them", said the 59-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of now, we have not learned anything," she lamented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will try to identify him through his clothes. He was wearing brown pants, a navy blue shirt, a black jacket, and beige boots."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She last saw him leaving on his bicycle from their shelter in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released on Monday, Hamas said Israel's delivery of bodies without identities "exacerbates the suffering of the families of martyrs and the missing, who seek to know the fate of their abducted children or to bury their martyrs in a dignified manner."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military did not offer an immediate comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In December, Hamas government sources said Israel returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians killed in Gaza after taking them from morgues and graves to check there were no hostages among them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bodies were then buried in Gaza, the sources added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory air and ground campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,623 people, according to Gaza's health ministry which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths. (AFP)

    Bangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman takes charge

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protesters march towards Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's palace. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764866_1_20240805212642.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladesh army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman spent nearly four decades rising to the top of the military and said on Monday he was "taking full responsibility" after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted and fled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Bedecked with medal ribbons on his green fatigues and wearing a four-star general's cap, Waker said 76-year-old Hasina had quit and that the army would "form an interim government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I give you my word that all the injustices will be addressed," the career infantry officer said in a broadcast to the nation on state television, although it was not immediately clear if he would head the new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed – it is time to stop the violence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mild-looking, bespectacled officer was appointed as chief of army staff, the military's top job, only in June. Hasina had trusted him because he was a distant relative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The experienced soldier has served as a UN peacekeeper as well as in Hasina's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His father-in-law was army chief during the first of Hasina's five terms as prime minister from 1996-2001.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a caretaker government for two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina then ruled Bangladesh from 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As protesters stormed Hasina's palace on Monday and she fled by helicopter, Waker said he would speak to the president to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed that the new authorities would "prosecute all murders" following weeks of deadly protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The army was deployed on the streets to crush the protests last month but shifted on Sunday and in several instances allowed demonstrations to go on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker said he had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members, although not with Hasina's Awami League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of us together will forge a beautiful future," he said. "If we work together, we can achieve a favourable outcome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bangladesh Military Academy graduate, who served two tours as a UN peacekeeper in Angola and Liberia, called for the weeks of protests to stop.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 300 people were killed in the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the situation gets better, there is no need for emergency," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker appealed to the university students who first launched protests in early July to support the army. The protests were initially against government hiring rules but spiralled into demands for Hasina to leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now the task of the students is to keep calm and help us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Waker, who Bangladeshi media say is aged 57 or 58, also received officer training in Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Married with two daughters, he holds master's degrees in defence studies from Bangladesh's National University and King's College London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was commissioned in 1985, also serving as an instructor at the army's college for infantry and tactics and at Bangladesh's institute for peace support operations. (AFP)

    UK PM Starmer vows rioters will 'regret' disorder

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK leader Keir Starmer warned far-right protesters on Sunday they would "regret" participating in England's worst rioting in 13 years, as disturbances linked to the murder of three children earlier this week flared across the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unrest related to misinformation about the mass stabbing last Monday in the northwestern English seaside town of Southport has hit multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is a major challenge for Starmer, elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online, and then running away themselves," Starmer said in a TV address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was "no justification" for what he called "far-right thuggery", he added, promising to bring the perpetrators "to justice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the northeastern English city of Middlesbrough, hundreds of protesters squared up to riot police carrying shields. Some threw bricks, cans and pots at officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Protesters there seized a camera from an AFP crew and broke it. The journalists were not injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fresh disturbances came after police said more than 150 people had been arrested since Saturday following skirmishes at far-right rallies in Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police -- injuring several officers -- and looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is the worst England has seen since summer 2011, when widespread rioting followed the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late Sunday, Staffordshire police said another hotel known to have sheltered asylum seekers was targeted near Birmingham.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large group of individuals" have been "throwing projectiles, smashing windows, starting fires and targeting police" at the hotel in the town of Tamworth, with one officer injured, said the statement. (AFP)

    Zelensky says Ukraine has received first F-16 jets

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine has received its first batch of US-made F-16 fighter jets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, quickly adding that more are needed to beat back Russian forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For more than two years, Ukraine has pleaded with its Western partners for the aircraft – long considered the crown jewel in the sprawling list of military hardware Kyiv has sought.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We often heard the word 'impossible'. Now it is a reality. Reality in our skies. F-16s in Ukraine. We made it happen," Zelensky said, as some flew above him during the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky was standing in front of what looked like two grey, partially-covered F-16s branded with the Ukrainian trident, in a location reporters were asked not to disclose for security reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am proud of all our guys who are mastering these aircraft and have already started using them for our country," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not say how many jets had been delivered and declined to comment on their specific tasks, but journalists saw at least two F-16s on the spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement was welcomed by many as Kyiv's forces are struggling to hold back advances by Russian troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the combat aircraft we have been waiting for, which can significantly enhance our capabilities," said Parliament chairman Ruslan Stefanchuk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kyiv hopes the arrival of the fighter jets – touted for their precision, speed and range – will enable it to better protect itself from Russian bombardment. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi protesters demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resign clashed with government supporters on Sunday, with scores killed in one of the deadliest days since demonstrations began.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rallies that began last month against civil service job quotas have escalated into some of the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old to step down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 77 people were killed on Sunday alone, including 14 police officers, with the rival sides battling with sticks and knives and security forces firing rifles, taking the total killed since protests began in July to at least 283.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said protesters attacked their officers, including storming a station in the northeastern town of Enayetpur.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The terrorists attacked the police station and killed 11 policemen," said Bijoy Basak, a deputy inspector general.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Witnesses in Dhaka reported hearing sustained crackles of gunfire after dark on Sunday, with protesters defying a nationwide curfew.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 12 people were killed in the capital, police and doctors at hospitals said, several with bullet wounds, while 18 were killed in Bangladesh's northern district of Sirajganj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mobile internet was tightly restricted countrywide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In several cases, soldiers and police did not intervene to stem the protests, unlike the past month of rallies that repeatedly ended in deadly crackdowns. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK authorities faced growing pressure on Sunday to put an end to England's worst rioting in 13 years after disturbances linked to child murders and involving far-riot agitators flared across the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Unrest related to misinformation about a mass stabbing that killed three young girls earlier this week has spread to multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is posing a major test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the latest incident, trouble flared in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Sunday when masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 people were arrested on Saturday after skirmishes broke out at far-right rallies in numerous places, including Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police – injuring several officers – looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is the worst England has seen since the summer of 2011, when widespread rioting took place following the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're now seeing it (trouble) flooding across major cities and towns," said Tiffany Lynch of the Police Federation of England and Wales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the police have "all the resources they need" to deal with the disorder, as forces drafted in thousands of extra officers to try to stop the violence from spreading further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Policing minister Diana Johnson told BBC News on Sunday that the rioting would "not be tolerated," while justice minister Shabana Mahmood has insisted that "the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disturbance in Rotherham marked the fifth day of skirmishes following Monday's frenzied knife attack at a Taylor Swift-theme dance party in Southport, near Liverpool on England's northwest coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, who is accused of killing a six, seven, and nine-year-old, and injuring another 10 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have blamed the violence on supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Agitators have targeted mosques in Southport and in the northeastern English city of Sunderland, leading to hundreds of Islamic centres bolstering security amid fears for their worshippers' safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants have waved English and British flags while chanting slogans like "Stop the boats" – a reference to irregular migrants travelling to Britain from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-fascist demonstrators have held counter-rallies in many cities, including Leeds where they shouted, "Nazi scum off our streets," as the far-right protesters chanted, "You're not English any more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not all the gatherings have turned violent. A peaceful one in Aldershot, southern England, on Sunday saw participants hold placards that read "Stop the invasion" and "We're not far right, we're just right."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are fed up with being told you should be ashamed if you're white and working class but I'm proud white working class," 41-year-old Karina, who did not give her surname, said in Nottingham on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commentators have suggested that the demonstrators, spurred on by online influencers, may feel emboldened by the political ascendancy of anti-immigration elements in British politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last month's election, the Reform UK party led by Brexit cheerleader Nigel Farage captured 14 percent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carla Denyer, co-leader of the left-wing Green party said the unrest should be "a wake-up call to all politicians who have actively promoted or given in" to anti-immigration rhetoric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and has announced new measures to allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling. (AFP)

    Hezbollah launches 'dozens' of rockets at Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Flares of the Israeli army light up the sky of the area bordering Lebanon amid ongoing cross-border clashes between Israeli troops and Lebanon's Hezbollah fighters. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764654_1_20240804090901.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah said on Saturday it had launched dozens of Katyusha rockets at Israel, the latest in a series of attacks it says is in support of the Palestinian people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Lebanese group said its latest attack, on Beit Hillel in northern Israel, was in response to Israel's attacks on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Middle East tensions soared on Saturday as Iran and its allies readied their response to the assassination of Hamas's political leader, blamed on Israel, spurring fears of a regional war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel ally the United States said it would move warships and fighter jets to the region, while Western governments called on their citizens to leave Lebanon -- where the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based -- and airlines cancelled flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing this week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran-backed groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel on Saturday again traded fire with Hezbollah, carried out a deadly raid in the occupied West Bank, and struck a school compound in Gaza City in an attack that the Hamas-ruled territory's civil defence agency said killed at least 17 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous schools turned into displacement shelters have been hit across Gaza in recent weeks, with Israel insisting the facilities had been used by militants. Hamas denied using civilian infrastructure for military activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh was buried on Friday in Qatar, where he had been based. Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of carrying out the attack, has not directly commented on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran said on Saturday it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pentagon said it was bolstering its military presence in the Middle East to protect US personnel and defend Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said an aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln would be deployed, as well as additional ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers and a new fighter squadron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden, at his beach home in Delaware, was asked by reporters if he thought Iran would stand down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope so," he said. "I don't know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at the northern Israeli settlement of Beit Hillel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said it was in response to an Israeli attack on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in southern Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its fighters, including a 17-year-old from Deir Siriane. (AFP)

    Far-right protesters clash with police in UK

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764637_1_20240804031024.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right protesters clashed with British police during tense rallies on Saturday as unrest linked to disinformation about a mass stabbing that killed three young girls spread across the UK.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The violence, which has seen scores of arrests across England and put Britain's Muslim community on edge, presents the biggest challenge yet of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer's month-old premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also put hard-right agitators in the spotlight at a time when anti-immigration elements are enjoying some electoral success in British politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators threw chairs, flares and bricks at officers in the northwestern English city of Liverpool, while scuffles between police and protesters broke out in nearby Manchester.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merseyside Police said "a number of officers have been injured as they deal with serious disorder" in Liverpool city centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC reported that protesters smashed the windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants in the northeastern city of Hull. Police said three officers had been injured and four people arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Belfast, Northern Ireland, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islam group and an anti-racism rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Leeds, northern England, around 150 people carrying English flags chanted, "You're not English any more" while counter-protesters shouted "Nazi scum off our streets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposing groups of protesters also faced off in the central city of Nottingham and Bristol in the southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The skirmishes marked the fourth day of unrest in several towns and cities following Monday's frenzied knife attack in Southport, near Liverpool on England's northwest coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, charged with several counts of murder and attempted murder over the attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rudakubana is accused of killing Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, and injuring another 10 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts would "face the full force of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And reacting to Saturday's clashes, he said there was "no excuse" for the violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After talks with senior ministers he "reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe," said a statement from his office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence started late on Tuesday in Southport itself, where a mob threw bricks at a mosque. That prompted hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police blamed supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unrest then rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later, where 111 people were arrested outside Starmer's Downing Street residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, 10 people were arrested and four officers required hospital treatment following a riot in the northeastern English city of Sunderland in which at least one car was set on fire and a shop looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mob also torched a police station and attacked a mosque.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder," Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall told reporters on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events planned for Saturday and Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were advertised on far-right social media channels as "enough is enough" anti-immigration rallies. Anti-fascism groups have staged numerous counter-protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In London, demonstrators attending a regular pro-Palestinian march appeared undeterred by a separate anti-immigration protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My parents told me not to come today but I am from here. The UK is my home," said 24-year-old student Meraaj Harun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer this week announced new measures that will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour politicians have accused Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage of stoking the trouble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last month's election, his anti-immigration Reform UK party captured 14 percent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party. (AFP)

    Thousands in Venezuela protest Maduro's victory claim

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado's appearance delighted the crowd. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764634_1_20240804022718.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people, led by a top opposition figure, gathered across Venezuela on Saturday to protest the widely disputed reelection of President Nicolas Maduro, as his supporters responded to his own call for competing rallies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado thrilled supporters in Caracas when she made a surprise appearance in a truck bearing a banner reading "Venezuela has won!" after spending several days in hiding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machado had backed the candidacy of Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia after she herself was banned from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Backers cried out "Freedom!" as her truck passed by on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never been so strong as today," Machado told the crowd, adding that "the regime has never been weaker... it has lost all legitimacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro also called on his supporters to turn out for "the mother of all marches" later in the afternoon. He accused the opposition of plotting attacks against security forces during their rallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eleven civilians reportedly have died and more than 1,000 have been detained in the protests that erupted after the country's CNE election authority, loyal to Maduro, on Friday proclaimed him the winner with 52 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Gonzalez Urrutia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that result has been rejected by countries including the United States, Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and Uruguay. They say available results show the opposition candidate to be the clear winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has ordered the expulsion of diplomats from some countries questioning his victory. Argentine diplomats who reached Buenos Aires on Saturday said power had been cut to their embassy, as hooded police kept guard outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 61-year-old Maduro has reacted fiercely to the widespread international criticism, describing allegations of vote fraud as a "trap" orchestrated by Washington to justify "a coup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has led the oil-rich, cash-poor country since 2013, presiding over a GDP drop of 80 percent that pushed more than seven million of once-wealthy Venezuela's 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts blame economic mismanagement and US sanctions for the collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia did not show up to a hearing at the Supreme Court after Maduro requested the tribunal investigate and certify the election result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, other opposition candidates summoned to the hearing called for a detailed vote count to be made public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has launched a website with copies of 84 percent of ballots cast, showing an easy win for Gonzalez Urrutia. The government claims these are forged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machado, who was barred from running herself, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that she was in hiding and "fearing for my life," along with other opposition leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO Foro Penal reported 11 dead in protests on Monday and Tuesday as angry Venezuelans took to the streets, and Machado said at least 20 people had been killed. Officials said one soldier died as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crackdown has sparked fear among opposition supporters, with memories still fresh of a wave of repression under the Maduro government in 2017 that left some 100 people dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have dead, wounded, detainees, missing people... People know it. They are afraid," Katiusca Camargo, an activist in the Petare slum in eastern Caracas, said on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday there was "overwhelming evidence" that Gonzalez Urrutia had won the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken spoke with Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia on Friday, expressing "his concern for their safety and well-being" and congratulating Gonzalez Urrutia "for receiving the most votes," the State Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a joint statement, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico urged an "impartial verification" of the result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro's previous reelection, in 2018, was rejected by dozens of Latin American countries as well as the United States and European Union member states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoys loyalty from the military leadership, electoral bodies, courts and other state institutions, as well as the backing of Russia, China and Cuba. (AFP)

    Surging Harris, Trump spar over debate dates

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kamala Harris's campaign communications director says Donald Trump is "running scared." Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764633_1_20240804013010.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris's campaign branded Donald Trump "scared" on Saturday after he proposed to change the presidential debate schedule ahead of a rally in Georgia where he will try to halt the vice president's surging momentum in her bid to become America's first woman president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an overnight post on his Truth Social app, Trump said he was willing to debate Harris on the conservative Fox News network on September 4, while declining to participate in a previously scheduled debate on ABC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump pitched the idea before going to a rally in Atlanta, where he will gather supporters in the same arena where Harris addressed an excited crowd of some 10,000 just this Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said he had "agreed" to the debate plan with Fox. And he said it would take place in Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state in the US presidential electoral system – in front of a live audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris campaign dismissed this as "games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out," Harris's campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. "He needs to... show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal to confront Harris on a network that has long supported him was the latest Trump effort to recapture the initiative in a campaign that had been entirely focused on a rematch against 81-year-old Joe Biden, until he dramatically dropped his reelection bid on July 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Harris, 59, has reenergised the Democratic base almost overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has raked in donations, reassembled the team behind Barack Obama's two historic election victories, and neutralised the solid lead that 78-year-old Trump had built against Biden in opinion polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, she secured the official Democratic nomination, backed by near unanimous party support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris is due imminently to announce her vice presidential pick, with the popular governor of key state Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, a frontrunner. On Tuesday, she is set to launch a countrywide tour with her yet-to-be-named running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, Trump will be joined by his own vice presidential pick, Senator JD Vance, at the rally in Georgia – another battleground state that will help decide who wins the Electoral College majority on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lost narrowly to Biden there in 2020 and the state was at the centre of his unprecedented attempts to overturn the results of the election and refusal to accept defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The size of Harris's rally on Tuesday was a warning sign to the Trump campaign, which has long touted its ability to draw thousands of passionate supporters, in contrast to Biden's usually meagre crowds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The situation is a remarkable turnaround in a campaign where Trump had been appearing to gather force while Biden – hurt by a disastrous debate performance in June and mounting voter concerns over his mental acuity – was steadily slipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris's rapid entry has left the Trump campaign scrambling – and Trump now the oldest presidential nominee in US history.

  Adding to the changed dynamics, Harris is vying to become the first woman president and the first of black and Indian bi-racial heritage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump drew gasps at a convention of black journalists this week when he claimed that Harris, who has identified closely with her black roots all her life, was only pretending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike struck a school compound in Gaza City on Saturday, killing at least 17 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are 17 martyrs and several wounded due to Israeli bombardment on Hamama school," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. The Israeli military confirmed the strike, saying it had hit a Hamas command and control centre located inside the compound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bassal said the compound was housing Palestinians displaced from their homes in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the compound was being used by Hamas militants to manufacture weapons, adding it was a "hiding place for Hamas terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilian facilities as command and control centres or to hide their commanders and militants. The Palestinian group denies the accusation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held hostage in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's withering military campaign has killed at least 39,550 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Flights to Beirut by Air France and low-cost carrier Transavia France will remain suspended until at least Tuesday due to "security" concerns in the region, parent company Air France-KLM said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two French airlines first stopped servicing the route on Monday, a day after Israel vowed to retaliate following rocket fire from Lebanon that killed 12 people in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any resumption of operation will be subject to a renewed evaluation on the ground," a spokesman said on Saturday, adding that passengers with reservations could rebook at no extra cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flights to Tel Aviv will continue as normal, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket attack on the Golan Heights sparked fears that fighting between Hezbollah and Israel would escalate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When those fears subsided somewhat the airlines announced on Tuesday that flights would resume on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israel then struck a Hezbollah stronghold in south Beirut on Tuesday evening, targeting a senior commander it blamed for the rocket strike on the Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This development sparked an extension of the flight suspension until Saturday, which has now been prolonged again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran said earlier on Saturday it expects the Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German carrier Lufthansa, meanwhile, has suspended flights until August 5. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764606_1_20240803192705.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 37 civilians were killed and more than 200 injured in an explosion on a popular beach in the Somali capital Mogadishu late on Friday evening, police said, an attack blamed by Somali state media on the militant Islamist group al Shabaab.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the deadliest attack in the Horn of Africa country since twin car bombs detonated near a busy market intersection in October 2022, killing at least 100 people and wounding 300 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate claim of responsibility by the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab, which has claimed similar attacks in the past, including the car bomb attack in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police spokesperson Abdifatah Aden gave the death toll in Friday evening's explosion at a beach restaurant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the civilians killed, Aden said that one of the attackers had blown himself up while three others had been killed by security forces. One attacker was captured alive while one soldier was killed during the assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State news agency SONNA had earlier said five al Shabaab attackers had been killed by security forces while a sixth had blown himself up during the assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hassan Farah, a survivor, described the shock as the explosion shattered a peaceful evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was in the restaurant sipping coffee and having a good chat with friends when I saw a big man running, in a second there was something like lightening and a huge blast," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were covered with smoke. Inside and outside the restaurant many people were lying on the floor while others were bleeding and crying." (Reuters)

    Vietnam names To Lam as top leader

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vietnam's Communist Party named President To Lam as the country's top leader on Saturday, after the death of his predecessor two weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This morning, August 3, 2024, the Party Central Committee... elected To Lam the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam," the party said at a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party's general secretary is the most powerful figure in Vietnam's leadership structure, with the president occupying a largely ceremonial role that includes meeting foreign counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear if Lam would continue to serve as president simultaneously or relinquish that role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first remarks as general secretary, Lam said his promotion resulted from "an urgent need to ensure the leadership of the party".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a huge honour with glorious responsibility before the party and the people," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nomination comes two weeks after the death of General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He died in the capital Hanoi "due to old age and serious illness" and Lam was informally handed the reins of power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam's formal succession to the top job follows a long career within the public security ministry. (AFP)

    Kim Jong-un hits out at Seoul over flooding reports

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Seoul on Thursday said it was willing to "urgently provide" humanitarian assistance to "North Korean disaster victims". Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764563_1_20240803101908.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un accused South Korean media outlets of spreading rumours about flood damage and casualties in his country, state media said on Saturday, days after Seoul reached out to offer humanitarian aid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  North Korea said earlier this week there had been unspecified casualties resulting from the flooding in its northern regions, in addition to damage to thousands of homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul on Thursday said it was willing to "urgently provide" humanitarian assistance to "North Korean disaster victims" following a South Korean news report that the toll of dead and missing could be as high as 1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by TV Chosun, which was later picked up by other outlets, also reported on the possible death of rescue workers killed in helicopter crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But North Korea's Kim slammed the reports for "spreading the false rumour that the human loss ... is expected be over 1,000 or 1,500", according to Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim "bitterly censured the inveterate habits and despicable nature of the ROK scum," referring to South Korea, KCNA said Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flooding reports constituted a South Korean "smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish" the North's image, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang said on Wednesday that officials who neglected their disaster prevention duties had caused unspecified casualties, without specifying the location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said on Saturday that there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said suffered the "greatest flood damage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter "within a few hours".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, but South Korea's unification and foreign ministries this week expressed condolences for the North's flood victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul said on Friday it had received no response after trying to offer humanitarian aid via the Koreas' liaison office communication channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea declared the South its principal enemy earlier this year, and Pyongyang has not responded to inter-Korean liaison hotline calls since April 2023. (AFP)

    Violence flares in UK city as police brace for more

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protests and counter-protests are expected across the UK this weekend. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764534_1_20240803052752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rioting flared late on Friday in Sunderland, northeast England, where police said officers were subjected to "serious violence," the latest unrest following a mass stabbing earlier this week that killed three young girls.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage shared on social media and broadcast by the BBC showed a mob of several hundred rampaging in Sunderland's city centre, attacking police and setting fire to at least one car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as police nationwide prepared for planned far-right rallies and other demonstrations this weekend, after two nights of unrest in several English towns and cities in the wake of Monday's knife attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London's Metropolitan Police said it had a "proportionate and risk-based" plan for rival pro-Palestinian and anti-immigration protests on Saturday. Late on Wednesday, its officers arrested 111 people as a rally in Westminster turned violent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Friday night's disturbances in Sunderland were an ominous sign for the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our officers are continuing to deal with ongoing disorder and have been subjected to serious violence," Northumbria Police said of the situation there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scenes that we are seeing are completely unacceptable," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional mayor Kim McGuinness said she was "appalled" at the fresh eruption of violence, this time in the northeast, which followed a calm night on Thursday across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If your response to tragedy is to use it to commit violence, to abuse others, attack the police and damage property you stand for nothing except thuggery," she said on X, echoing comments by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Merseyside Police said extra officers had been deployed in and around Liverpool city centre "to help prevent disorder or criminality" there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed social media reports of planned far-right gatherings and counter-protests in the northwest English city, which lies close to the seaside town of Southport where Monday's knife attack occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right elements have been blamed for the disturbances in the aftermath of the stabbing spree targeting children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have said online misinformation about the British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana has helped fuel the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He faces murder and attempted murder charges over the stabbing rampage that also left five children and two adults critically wounded and which has shocked Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have said the case is not being treated as terror-related but have not revealed a motive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anger over the tragedy has fused with growing anti-immigration sentiment on the right of English politics, pushed by openly Islamophobic far-right figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After violence in Southport late on Tuesday, unrest rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Southport, the mob targeted a mosque, prompting hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security amid fears of more anti-Islamic demonstrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faith leaders says mosques have been hiring paid security staff and checking their CCTV cameras are working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Muslim community is deeply anxious right now," said Zara Mohammed, secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts will "face the full force of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In power for less than a month, the prime minister met on Friday with local leaders in Southport to discuss "a package of support for the local community," his Downing Street office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's visit came the day after he announced a new "national capability" to tackle disorder in the wake of the recent disturbances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new measures will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police nationwide were mobilising for trouble this weekend, after far-right social media channels advertised "enough is enough" anti-immigrant rallies and anti-facism groups vowed to stage counter-protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enough is enough" has emerged as a rallying online slogan for the far-right and others following Monday's attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Yorkshire police said on Friday it knew of a planned protest in the town of Rotherham and that people might see "an increased police presence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers in south Wales said a policing operation would be in place for events being planned for Saturday in Cardiff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police in Northern Ireland noted social media posts calling for roadblocks "using women and children," as well as a march to an Islamic centre in Belfast on Saturday. (AFP)

    Judge suspends Justin Timberlake's NY driver's licence

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Timberlake made a virtual court appearance on Friday in his drunken driving case on Long Island, saying little during the brief proceeding as a judge accepted his not-guilty plea and suspended his right to drive in New York.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police in the seaside village of Sag Harbor arrested Timberlake June 18 after they say he ran a stop sign, veered out of his lane and got out of his BMW smelling of alcohol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former NSYNC singer, who is on tour in Europe, wasn't required by the court to return to the US for his court date. He is performing on Saturday night in Antwerp, Belgium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His attorney, Edward Burke Jr, has maintained that Timberlake was not drunk and that the case should be dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The facts remain he was not intoxicated,” Burke said on Friday, according to Newsday. “I’ll say it again: Justin Timberlake was not intoxicated and we’re very confident that charge, that criminal charge, will be dismissed.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sag Harbor Village Justice Carl Irace suspended Timberlake's Tennessee driver's licence in New York state and threatened to impose a gag order on Burke, saying the attorney's comments to the media have been inappropriate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irace set a next court date for August 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake had appeared in court in person previously but his arraignment needed to be repeated because of a paperwork oversight. Burke said the original charging document lacked a police sergeant’s signature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant District Attorney Ashley Cangro said new documents were filed July 2 to address that flaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake was pulled over after leaving a Sag Harbor hotel around 12:30 am, according to police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “His eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odour of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot and he performed poorly on all standardised field sobriety tests,” police said in a court filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake, 43, told the officer he had had one martini and was following some friends home, according to police. He was arrested and spent the night in custody at a police station. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris effectively secured the Democratic party's presidential nomination on Friday, confirming her remarkable rise to party standard bearer in November's showdown against Republican Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Harris was the sole candidate on the ballot for a five-day electronic vote of nearly 4,000 party convention delegates. She will be officially crowned at a Chicago convention later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am honoured to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States," Harris, 59, said on a phone-in to a party celebration after securing enough votes by the second day of the marathon vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the two weeks since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Harris has gained full control of the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other Democrats stepped forward to challenge her elevation to the top of the ticket, making her confirmation as the first black and south Asian woman ever to secure a major party's nomination a formality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came with Harris preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for a swing across seven crucial battleground states with her newly minted running mate – who is expected to be revealed within days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democratic Party decided on a virtual nomination process – mirroring the pandemic-hit 2020 vote – because of Ohio's August 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The virtual roll call marks the official beginning of the 2024 convention, although in practice the festivities really get going when thousands of party faithful descend on Chicago on August 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will feature ceremonial votes for Harris and her running mate in what is expected to be a raucous celebration of her rise from state politics to the top of the ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's White House bid was thrown into chaos on July 21 when Biden, 81, withdrew his candidacy, backing Harris as the Democratic nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice president has already smashed fundraising records, packed arenas and wiped out Trump's polling leads over Biden, creating momentum that she hopes she can ride through the convention to the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is set to make her first public appearance with her running mate on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state whose Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is among a handful candidates being vetted to potentially join the Harris ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The swing will take Harris through all the "blue wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where she will seek to rebuild the coalition that carried Biden to victory in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she will extend the tour to the much more racially diverse Sun Belt and southern states of Georgia, North Carolina Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada as she seeks to shore up the black and Hispanic vote that had been peeling away from the Democrats. (AFP)

    Weak jobs data sparks worries about US economy

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data shows US unemployment edging up to 4.3 percent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764508_1_20240803000230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with sustained higher interest rates taking a toll on businesses and consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Friday’s report from the US Labor Department showed that employers added just 114,000 jobs in July – 35 percent fewer than forecasters had expected – and that unemployment, now up to 4.3 percent, was the highest since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Things are deteriorating quickly,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news shook financial markets around the world, with the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq both dropping sharply at the open of trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sturdiness of the US economy — the world’s largest — has been a key driver of global economic growth and the US jobs market is a big reason for it, underpinning the American expansion and giving consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unemployment rate's jump to 4.3 percent in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signalled that the United States is in recession — though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the topsy-turvy post-pandemic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weak jobs report came two days after the Federal Reserve said it would hold off on cutting interest rates until it sees more evidence that inflation is continuing to move down and closer to its 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterised the American job market as healthy, despite growing calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high, to pre-empt a major weakening of the US economy and job market. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mourners and supporters bid farewell on Friday in Qatar to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after his killing in Tehran, blamed on Israel, has heightened regional tensions as the Gaza war dragged on.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of people gathered at the Gulf emirate's largest mosque, where Haniyeh's casket, draped in a Palestinian flag, was taken before leaving again for burial in Lusail, north of Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh, the Palestinian armed group's political chief, played a key role in mediated talks aimed at ending nearly 10 months of war between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His killing triggered calls for revenge and raised questions about the continued viability of such negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mourners lined up for funeral prayers inside Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab Mosque, while others prayed on mats outside in temperatures that reached 44 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony ended in angry chants, but the short-lived demonstration quickly dispersed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was a symbol, a resistance leader... people are angry," said Taher Adel, 25, a Jordanian student residing in the Qatari capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's predecessor Khaled Meshaal spoke at the ceremony, saying the slain leader had "served his cause, his people... and never abandoned them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday to honour Haniyeh, while Hamas called for a "day of furious rage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan were among the officials at the funeral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ismail Hanyieh is a symbol for all Muslims," said Qatari Ahmed Mahmoud, 48, at the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There must be a reaction. Israel must know we will defend ourselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the president of the United Arab Emirates, said his country – which in 2020 normalised ties with Israel – rejects "violence and political assassination in all its forms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Doha mourners wore scarves that combined the Palestinian flag with a checkered keffiyeh pattern and the message in English: "Free Palestine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in a pre-dawn "hit" on their accommodation in Tehran on Wednesday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said. Haniyeh was in Iran to attend the swearing-in of President Masoud Pezeshkian a day earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of the attack, has not directly commented on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing of Qatar-based Haniyeh is among several incidents since April that have sent regional tensions soaring during the Gaza war, which has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian officials met with representatives of these groups on Wednesday to discuss the next steps, said a source close to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source who had been briefed on the meeting and requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met with his visiting British counterpart John Healey on Friday and stressed "the importance of establishing a coalition" to support "Israel's defence against Iran and its proxies," Gallant's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France urged its nationals visiting Iran to leave "due to the increased risk of a military escalation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the Gaza war, Hezbollah and Israeli forces have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire, and did so again on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, the civil defence agency reported several people killed in the territory's north, and Israel's military said it had killed around 30 militants near Rafah, in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's assassination came hours after Israel struck a southern suburb of Beirut, killing Fuad Shukr, the military commander of Lebanese Hamas ally Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's deputy, Saleh al-Aruri, was killed in Beirut early this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another high-profile killing, Israel's army on Thursday confirmed that an air strike in July killed Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel "delivered crushing blows to all our enemies," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack that ignited the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh in Tehran, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York Times, citing Middle Eastern officials, has reported that Haniyeh was killed by an explosive device planted weeks ago at a Tehran guesthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the report, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists "there was no other Israeli aerial attack... in all the Middle East" on the night of Shukr's killing in Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said Shukr's assassination – for which Hezbollah said retaliation was "inevitable" – was a response to rocket fire which killed 12 youths last week in the annexed Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian news agency Fars said the US report was a "lie," insisting that the Hamas leader was killed by a "projectile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analyst Hugh Lovatt said Haniyeh's killing at the very least "will mean that a ceasefire deal with Israel is now totally off of the table."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said US President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu by telephone on Thursday and affirmed his commitment to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have the basis for a ceasefire (in Gaza)... They should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call. (AFP)

    Row over Olympic boxing gender scandal deepens

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei in action with Sitora Turdibekova of Uzbekistan. She is one of two athletes at the centre of a brewing controversy at the Olympics over gender. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764500_1_20240802224116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The double world champion from Chinese Taipei, Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the heart of a gender row, won her featherweight round of 16 bout against Uzbekistan's Sidora Turdibekova on points by unanimous decision at the Paris Olympics on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old Lin, along with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won her round of 16 welterweight fight on Thursday against Italy's Angela Carini in 46 seconds, have been in the spotlight of the gender row after being cleared to compete in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules that prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women's events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing tournament in Paris, has cleared the boxers to compete in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IBA said in a statement the athletes "did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the "specifics" of this test "remain confidential", the IBA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the Olympic body's eligibility criteria was based on the gender indicated on the boxers' passports, but acknowledged that it's "not a black and white issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither Lin nor Khelif is known to identify as transgender and both competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 in the women's competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The row has expanded outside the ring, with politicians and celebrities weighing in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the Khelif-Carini fight was "not on an equal footing", after the Italian fighter was left with a badly hurt nose and in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US presidential candidate Donald Trump declared on his Truth Social network that he would keep "men out of women's sports".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate JD Vance described Thursday's one-sided bout between Khelif-Carini as a "grown man pummelling a woman in a boxing match", adding: "This is disgusting, and all of our leaders should condemn it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Potter author JK Rowling said on X, formerly Twitter, that the Paris Games would be "forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini". (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan are expected to be released by Russia as part of one of the biggest East-West prisoner swaps since the Cold War, according to US media on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CNN and other US networks reported the news, with ABC News reporting that the swap involved numerous countries and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate confirmation from US officials. The Kremlin declined to comment on any exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still have no comment on this topic," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March 2023 and convicted in July on spying charges in a fast-track trial denounced as a sham by the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of an imminent prisoner swap had picked up momentum on Thursday, amid reports a plane used in a previous exchange deal had landed in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopes had also risen in recent days days after a number of high-profile prisoners in Russia, including Whelan, went missing from prisons where they were serving long terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those expected to be returned to Russia in exchange is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian citizen imprisoned in Germany for killing a former Chechen rebel commander in a brazen assassination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exchange would be a victory for US President Joe Biden, whose vice president, Kamala Harris, faces Republican Donald Trump in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would be the first prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since star US basketball player Brittney Griner was swapped in return for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022. (AFP)

    Trump queries whether Kamala Harris is really black

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Donald Trump has accused his Democratic rival of happening to "turn black". Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764147_1_20240801033646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has questioned whether Democrat Kamala Harris is really black or is using race as a political convenience in an interview that sent shockwaves through the 2024 presidential contest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black," Trump told a panel of interviewers at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And now she wants to be known as black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?" he said of Harris, who is the first black, female, and South-Asian-heritage vice president in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I respect either one but she obviously doesn't, because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn, and she became a black person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The provocative comments by the Republican presidential nominee were the latest in a stream of ratcheted up personal attacks by the 78-year-old on Harris, and follow his multiple remarks this week in which he accused Harris -- who is married to a Jewish-American -- of being anti-Semitic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden's White House swiftly responded to Trump's comments, calling them "insulting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the first black woman to hold the position, told reporters. (AFP)

 Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great joy that we received this news," Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, said. "Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five women representing 34 countries and regions will kick off the contest at 2pm Hong Kong time, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Jason Ng will participate in the men's event, which begins at 4.45pm, immediately after the women's race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The results of the latest water analyses...have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place," Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris has spent US$1.52 billion of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, the Palestinian militant group and Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said in separate statements on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian’s swearing in ceremony on Tuesday. The Guards said the attack was under investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Early this morning, the residence of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was struck, resulting in his and one of his body guards' martyrdom. The cause is under investigation and will be announced soon," the Revolutionary Guards said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamist faction, Hamas, mourned the death of Haniyeh, who it said was killed in "a treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts on Iranian state television immediately began blaming Israel for the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israel had vowed to kill Haniyeh and other leaders of Hamas over the group’s October 7 attack on the country that killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel itself did not immediately comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Israel's war with Hamas since the October attack, more than 39,360 Palestinians have been killed and more than 90,900 wounded, according to health authorities in Gaza. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said its fighter jets "eliminated" Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in the area of Beirut on Tuesday, accusing him of being responsible for a rocket strike on the annexed Golan Heights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israeli air force fighter jets eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist organisation's most senior military commander and the head of its strategic unit, Fuad Shukr, in the area of Beirut," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fuad Shukr was the commander responsible for the Majdal Shams massacre, in which 12 children were murdered after Hezbollah fired an Iranian Falaq-1 rocket directly at a soccer field in northern Israel on Saturday evening," military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a separate video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fuad Shukr was the right-hand man to Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader and his advisor in planning and directing attacks and operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hagari said Shukr was a "senior terrorist who has the blood of Israelis and many others on his hands".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the Gaza war, Shukr directed Hezbollah's attacks on Israel, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets and UAVs, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said that in the 1990s the Hezbollah commander was "directly involved" in the abduction of the bodies of three Israeli soldiers -- Benyamin Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Sawaid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three were killed by Hezbollah while patrolling the security fence adjacent to Har Dov, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since then, he has planned and directed numerous terror attacks against innocent civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Israel wanted to end hostilities without any wider war with Hezbollah, its forces were ready for "any scenario," Hagari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah's ongoing aggression and brutal attacks are dragging the people of Lebanon and the entire Middle East into a wider escalation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we prefer to resolve hostilities without a wider war, the IDF (Israeli army) is fully prepared for any scenario." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Landslides in India triggered by pounding monsoon rains struck tea plantations and killed at least 108 people on Tuesday, with at least 250 others rescued from mud and debris, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The southern coastal state of Kerala has been battered by torrential downpours, with blocked roads into the disaster area in Wayanad district complicating relief efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "93 dead bodies have been found so far," Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters. "This is one of the worst natural calamities that our state has seen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 128 people had been hospitalised for treatment after their rescue, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wayanad is famed for the tea estates that crisscross its hilly countryside and which rely on a large pool of casual labourers for planting and harvest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several estates in the district were hit by two successive landslides before dawn when most of their inhabitants were asleep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images published by the National Disaster Response Force showed rescue crews trudging through mud to search for survivors and carry bodies on stretchers out of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Homes were caked with brown sludge as the force of the landslide scattered cars, corrugated iron and other debris around the disaster site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army said it had deployed more than 200 soldiers to the area to assist state security forces and fire crews in search-and-rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kerala state excise minister M.B. Rajesh said more than 250 people had been rescued so far, The Hindu newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's office said families of victims would receive a compensation payment of US$2,400.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More rainfall and strong winds were forecast in Kerala on Tuesday, the state's disaster management agency said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Early morning landslides in India triggered by pounding monsoon rains have killed at least 10 people with hundreds more feared trapped under the earth, officials said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The southern coastal state of Kerala has been battered by torrential downpours, and the collapse of a key bridge at the disaster site in Wayanad district has hampered rescue efforts, according to local media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 have been confirmed dead so far, a district official in Wayanad told AFP on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army said it had deployed more than 200 soldiers to the area to assist state security forces and fire crews in search and rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hundreds of people are suspected to have been trapped," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had assured the Kerala government of "all possible help" with the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured," he said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More rainfall and strong winds were forecast in Kerala on Tuesday, the state's disaster management agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who until recently represented Wayanad in parliament, said he was "deeply anguished" by the disaster. "I hope those still trapped are brought to safety soon," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they also bring destruction every year in the form of landslides and floods. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World Triathlon on Tuesday said the Paris Olympics men's triathlon event will be postponed by a day, after tests showed the water quality in the River Seine was not up to standard.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The development means Hong Kong's Jason Ng is now scheduled to compete on Wednesday at 4.45pm. He was originally going to race at 2pm on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tests carried out in the Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held," World Triathlon said in a statement, adding the International Olympic Committee, Meteo France and Paris officials were involved in conducting the water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, meteorological events beyond our control, such as the rain which fell over Paris on 26 and 27 July, can alter water quality and compel us to reschedule the event for health reasons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's triathlon event will also take place on Wednesday, with World Triathlon saying both events are subject to future water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Paris based hydrologist had earlier told RTHK that rainstorms in the 24 hours before a swimming event in the Seine could wash storm water off the land surfaces around the city, bringing pollution with it.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British TV news presenter Huw Edwards, a household name in Britain, has been charged with three counts of making indecent pictures of children, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edwards, 62, was the BBC's highest paid news presenter and anchored the broadcaster's "BBC News at Ten" bulletin for more than two decades. He resigned in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been charged with three counts of making an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child relating to images found on a child's phone, according to court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat," a London police spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Edwards was arrested on 8 November, 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was bailed to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards was one of the main faces at the BBC until his departure, announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation, and leading coverage of the biggest events in Britain since the turn of the century, including elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He quit on medical advice after allegations emerged that he had paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edna O'Brien, the radical Irish writer whose groundbreaking first novel "The Country Girls" was burned and banned in her native country, has died, her publisher announced on Sunday. She was 93.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She died peacefully on Saturday 27 July after a long illness," said a statement from publishers Faber Books posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faber called her "one of the greatest writers of our age."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish President Michael D Higgins said he had learned of the death of his "dear friend" O'Brien with "great sorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was "one of the outstanding writers of modern times" and "a fearless teller of truths," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "While the beauty of her work was immediately recognised abroad, it is important to remember the hostile reaction it provoked among those who wished for the lived experience of women to remain far from the world of Irish literature, with her books shamefully banned upon their early publication."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The honours she eventually received from her native Ireland included the Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Country Girls" (1960), about the sexual initiation of rebellious Catholic girls, drawn from O'Brien's childhood experiences, is now a marker in modern Irish literature for its breaking of social and sexual taboos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Brien was born in 1930 into a strict Catholic farming family in west Ireland's County Clare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was educated at a convent school and then in Dublin where she graduated with a pharmacist's licence in 1950, around the time she was discovering a passion for Leo Tolstoy, F Scott Fitzgerald and TS Eliot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2018, she won the prestigious PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, honoured for having broken down "social and sexual barriers for women in Ireland and beyond."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2021, France made her a Commander in the "Ordre des Arts et des Lettres," the nation's highest cultural distinction. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The wildfires that destroyed nearly a third of the beloved tourist town of Jasper in western Canada are now under control, but firefighters are still battling other nearby blazes that could go on for months, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fires, touched off on Monday by lightning strikes in a drought-stricken area, are the biggest to hit the vast Jasper National Park in a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 30 percent of the structures in the town of Jasper – a popular tourist destination considered a scenic "jewel" of the Canadian Rockies – have been destroyed, though no deaths have been reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are anticipating that all remaining fires within the townsite will be extinguished today," Parks Canada, the government agency that manages the country's national parks, said on Sunday on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 25,000 residents and tourists were evacuated from Jasper beginning late on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parks Canada said teams working in Jasper on Sunday were continuing to secure the town's perimeter to prevent new outbreaks and protect critical infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters – their numbers bolstered by some 400 colleagues from New Zealand, Mexico and South Africa – were using a helicopter to spot and extinguish any flare-ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the town and the national park remain under evacuation orders. Royal Canadian Mounted Police are patrolling the area, limiting access to "incident staff and critical contractors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town will be reopened only "when the risk of wildfire activity is significantly reduced," Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Landon Shepherd, an agency official, said bringing the fire under control throughout the national park would "not be easy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) of forestland have gone up in smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout Alberta, 135 wildfires remained active on Sunday, about a quarter of them deemed out of control, Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 185 miles (300 kilometres) to the south of Jasper, in British Columbia province, residents of Slocan, a village of some 600 houses, have also had to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As in the United States, Canada's western region has been hard-hit by wildfires this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Repeated heat waves and dry conditions, both likely linked to global climate change, are believed to be key factors, scientists say. (AFP)

    Hezbollah evacuates positions ahead of expected attack

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah has evacuated positions in south and east Lebanon after Israeli threats of reprisals for a deadly strike on the annexed Golan Heights, a source close to the group said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to "hit the enemy hard" a day after rocket fire from Lebanon killed 12 young people in Majdal Shams, again raising fears that the war in Gaza will spread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah movement for firing a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket but the Iran-backed group – which has regularly targeted Israeli military positions – said it had "no connection" to the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah has evacuated some positions in the south and in the Bekaa valley that it thinks could be a target for Israel," the source close to the group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has a strong presence in east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, which borders Syria, and in south Lebanon, from where it has been launching near daily attacks on Israeli positions since October in support of ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cross-border exchanges of fire have largely been limited to the border area, but Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside Lebanon, including overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah is also deployed in Syria, where for years it has been fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said pro-Iran groups and Hezbollah-affiliated fighters have "evacuated their positions" south of the capital and in the Damascus countryside, as well as in parts of the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights, in anticipation of "potential Israeli airstrikes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah had already abandoned positions in Syria in early June after Israeli raids, according to the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters, including from Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raids also seek to cut off Hezbollah supply routes to Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's raids on Syria intensified after Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip, then eased after an April 1 strike blamed on Israel hit the Iranian consular building in Damascus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That strike prompted Iran to launch a first-ever direct missile and drone attack against Israel on April 13-14, sending regional tensions skyrocketing. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans booed a Dutch beach volleyball player convicted of raping an underage girl as he played his first match at the Paris Olympics, where his controversial selection has put the sport in the spotlight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven van de Velde, now 29, was convicted in 2016 of raping an underage girl and sentenced to four years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He walked onto centre court Sunday with teammate Matthew Immers on Sunday morning to cheers and applause, with many orange-clad Dutch fans standing to clap the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he was introduced individually over the loudspeaker, however, there was a loud chorus of boos from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also sporadic boos as he served throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player has won the backing of his country's national Olympic committee, and exchanged a warm hug with teammate Immers before the start of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his selection has drawn outrage among women's and sports safety groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the player would be separated from his teammates, not stay in the athletes' village, and forbidden from speaking to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His teammate Immers told reporters after the match that they had been "disappointed" by all the focus on van de Velde's past conviction, particularly after a "hard fight" to qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know the guy for two, three years together and we played every tournament," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me that's a big example that you grew, you learned a lot from it. What happened in the past... it's not good of course. But right now we are trying to enjoy and go to the next round," Immers added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ju'Riese Colon, chief executive of the US-based Center for SafeSport, said she was "deeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate" in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With teams from around the world convening in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety," she said. (AFP)

    Tense Venezuela votes in shadow of 'bloodbath' warning

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Incumbent Nicolas Maduro has warned of a "bloodbath" if he loses. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763576_1_20240728223317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelans voted on Sunday between continuity in President Nicolas Maduro or change in rival Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia amid high tension following the incumbent's threat of a "bloodbath" if he loses, which polls suggest is likely.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With several international observers blocked from entering the South American country at the last minute, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for all parties to "respect the democratic process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Venezuelan people deserve an election that genuinely reflects their will, free from any manipulation. The international community is going to be watching this very closely," Blinken told reporters in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long queues of voters formed at several voting stations hours before polls opened at 6:00 am (1000 GMT). Polls close at 6:00 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have been here since 4:30 in the morning, and I hope it will be a successful day," lawyer Griselda Barroso, 54, said in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope there is democracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro, 61, is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is seeking a third six-year term at the helm of the once wealthy petro-state that saw GDP drop 80 percent in a decade, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a message published on social media overnight, Maduro urged Venezuelans to "Vote, vote, vote, and peace will triumph."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia, a 74-year-old former diplomat, called on his compatriots to turn out in large numbers "to transform your future" in what "will undoubtedly be the most important democratic expression of the people in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope and wish that everything will transpire in peace," he said in a video posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro lags far behind Gonzalez Urrutia in voter intention, according to independent polls, but counts on a loyal electoral machinery, military leadership and state institutions in a system of well-established political patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relying on its own figures, the government is also said to be certain of victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls suggest Sunday's vote poses the biggest threat yet to 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Maduro's predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chavez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts say the president is unlikely to concede defeat, especially in the absence of immunity guarantees, with his government under investigation for human rights abuses by the International Criminal Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Days before the vote, Maduro said the outcome would decide whether Venezuela enters a period of "peace or war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they do not want Venezuela to become a bloodbath, a fratricidal civil war produced by the fascists, let us guarantee the greatest success, the greatest electoral victory of our people," he said at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments drew condemnation from leaders including Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said: "Maduro has to learn: if you win, you stay. If you lose, you go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns were further stoked when Caracas blocked several international observers, including four ex-presidents who had their plane held up in Panama on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, a Venezuelan NGO said the government was holding 305 "political prisoners" and had arrested 135 people with links to the opposition campaign since January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caracas accuses the opposition of conspiring against Maduro, whose 2018 reelection was rejected as illegitimate by most Western and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Years of tough US sanctions failed to dislodge the president, who enjoys support from Cuba, Russia and China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has repeatedly vowed that he won't cede power now even as Venezuelans clamour for change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government blames sanctions, but observers point the finger at corruption and mismanagement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 21 million Venezuelans are registered to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has deployed tens of thousands of security forces and enforced ramped-up border control and a prohibition on public gatherings and protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the election in Venezuela will hardly be free or fair, Venezuelans have their best chance in over a decade to elect their government," Human Rights Watch Americas director Juanita Goebertus said this week, urging the international community to "have their (voters') back." (AFP)

    France eyes return to normal on trains 'by Monday'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Engineers from national rail operator SNCF repair cables damaged in the attacks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763483_1_20240728042748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's national rail operator on Saturday said train travel was gradually returning to normal after multiple sabotage acts paralysed the network hours ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It remains unclear who carried out the three attacks overnight Thursday to Friday on rail infrastructure and if they were deliberately timed to disrupt the Olympics opening ceremony that took place later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a message of support for the sabotage was sent to several media outlets on Saturday, which also criticised the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of rail passengers struggled through a second day of cancelled and delayed trains on Saturday with 160,000 of the 800,000 people due to travel on a major holiday getaway weekend still facing cancellations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said national rail operator SNCF had mobilised a hundred workers overnight to repair the damage "in difficult weather conditions" and ensure a return to normal for Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the night, "with floodlights, in the rain, they patched up the wires one by one," said SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything will be repaired by Monday morning" on the SNCF network, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fibre optic cables running near the tracks and ensuring the transmission of safety information for drivers, such as signalling lights and points, were cut and set on fire during the night from Thursday to Friday on three of the main TGV lines, in the west, north and east of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No claim of responsibility has been made for the meticulously planned night-time attacks. Maintenance workers thwarted a fourth attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a statement sent to several news media expressed support for the sabotage and criticised the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They call it a festival? We see it as a celebration of nationalism, a gigantic stating of the subjugation of populations by states," said the email received by the newspaper La Provence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the headline of the message said, "claim to sabotage," no details of the action were provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was signed by "an unexpected delegation" and was sent via the online platform Riseup, whose users include those advocating for social change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris prosecutors on Friday opened a probe into an attack on "fundamental national interests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observers have noted that the nature of the attacks indicate the culprits would have needed deep knowledge of the functioning of the railways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the investigation was progressing, as he also expressed "relief" that the opening ceremony had taken place without any mishap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have uncovered a certain number of elements that allow us to think that we will soon know who is responsible for what clearly did not sabotage the Olympic Games but did sabotage part of the holidays of the French people," Darmanin told France 2 television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was "too early" to say who was behind the attack. "It could have come from inside (France) or from the outside."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities are on high alert for a terrorist attack during the Games, which run through August 11. Tens of thousands of police and troops are on security duties during the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 250,000 people missed their train on Friday, according to SNCF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three out of every 10 trains were cancelled on Saturday in the three regions affected by the attacks, with most trains still operating delayed by between one and two hours, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly one third of trains were cancelled in northern, western and eastern France. About a quarter of Eurostar high speed trains between Paris and London and Paris and Brussels were also called off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With normal services set to be fully restored on Monday, the situation is already expected to improve markedly on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine out of 10 TGV high speed trains will be able to run on the western and southwestern lines on Sunday, while service will be more patchy in the north, where seven out of 10 trains are due to run, SNCF said. Trains to eastern France have not been affected. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA deducted six points from Canada in the Paris Olympics women’s football tournament and banned three coaches for one year each on Saturday in a drone spying scandal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The stunning swath of punishments include a US$226,000 fine for the Canadian soccer federation in a case that has spiraled at the Summer Games. Two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand’s practices before their opening game last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Bev Priestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, already was suspended by the national soccer federation then removed from the Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priestman and her two assistants implicated in the case, Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander, are now banned from all soccer for one year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA fast-tracked its own disciplinary process by asking its appeals judges to handle the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA judges found Priestman and her two assistants “were each found responsible for offensive behavior and violation of the principles of fair play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Canadian federation was held responsible for not ensuring its staff complied with tournament rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coaches and the Canadian federation now can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport's special Olympic court in Paris. That tribunal is set up for urgent hearings and verdicts at the Olympics. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 11 people were killed in a rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, Israeli Channel 13 reported, amid an escalation of fire between Israel and armed groups in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli emergency service said earlier that 11 people were critically wounded by a rocket fired from Lebanon that hit a village football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams. A medic described great destruction and fire at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However senior Hezbollah media representative Mohammad Afif denied responsibility for the strike on Majdal Shams.
