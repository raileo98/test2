<div class="itemFullText">
 UK authorities faced growing pressure on Sunday to put an end to England's worst rioting in 13 years after disturbances linked to child murders and involving far-riot agitators flared across the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Unrest related to misinformation about a mass stabbing that killed three young girls earlier this week has spread to multiple towns and cities, with anti-immigration demonstrators clashing with police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is posing a major test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was elected only a month ago after leading Labour to a landslide win over the Conservatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the latest incident, trouble flared in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on Sunday when masked anti-immigration demonstrators smashed several windows at a hotel that has been used to house asylum seekers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 90 people were arrested on Saturday after skirmishes broke out at far-right rallies in numerous places, including Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Blackpool and Hull, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some instances, rioters threw bricks, bottles and flares at police – injuring several officers – looted and burnt shops, while demonstrators shouted anti-Islamic slurs as they clashed with counter-protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence is the worst England has seen since the summer of 2011, when widespread rioting took place following the police killing of a mixed-race man in north London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're now seeing it (trouble) flooding across major cities and towns," said Tiffany Lynch of the Police Federation of England and Wales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the police have "all the resources they need" to deal with the disorder, as forces drafted in thousands of extra officers to try to stop the violence from spreading further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Policing minister Diana Johnson told BBC News on Sunday that the rioting would "not be tolerated," while justice minister Shabana Mahmood has insisted that "the whole justice system is ready to deliver convictions as quickly as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The disturbance in Rotherham marked the fifth day of skirmishes following Monday's frenzied knife attack at a Taylor Swift-theme dance party in Southport, near Liverpool on England's northwest coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, who is accused of killing a six, seven, and nine-year-old, and injuring another 10 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have blamed the violence on supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Agitators have targeted mosques in Southport and in the northeastern English city of Sunderland, leading to hundreds of Islamic centres bolstering security amid fears for their worshippers' safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rallies have been advertised on far-right social media channels under the banner "Enough is enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants have waved English and British flags while chanting slogans like "Stop the boats" – a reference to irregular migrants travelling to Britain from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-fascist demonstrators have held counter-rallies in many cities, including Leeds where they shouted, "Nazi scum off our streets," as the far-right protesters chanted, "You're not English any more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Not all the gatherings have turned violent. A peaceful one in Aldershot, southern England, on Sunday saw participants hold placards that read "Stop the invasion" and "We're not far right, we're just right."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are fed up with being told you should be ashamed if you're white and working class but I'm proud white working class," 41-year-old Karina, who did not give her surname, said in Nottingham on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commentators have suggested that the demonstrators, spurred on by online influencers, may feel emboldened by the political ascendancy of anti-immigration elements in British politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last month's election, the Reform UK party led by Brexit cheerleader Nigel Farage captured 14 percent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carla Denyer, co-leader of the left-wing Green party said the unrest should be "a wake-up call to all politicians who have actively promoted or given in" to anti-immigration rhetoric.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and has announced new measures to allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling. (AFP)

    Hezbollah launches 'dozens' of rockets at Israel

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Flares of the Israeli army light up the sky of the area bordering Lebanon amid ongoing cross-border clashes between Israeli troops and Lebanon's Hezbollah fighters. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764654_1_20240804090901.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah said on Saturday it had launched dozens of Katyusha rockets at Israel, the latest in a series of attacks it says is in support of the Palestinian people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Lebanese group said its latest attack, on Beit Hillel in northern Israel, was in response to Israel's attacks on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Middle East tensions soared on Saturday as Iran and its allies readied their response to the assassination of Hamas's political leader, blamed on Israel, spurring fears of a regional war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel ally the United States said it would move warships and fighter jets to the region, while Western governments called on their citizens to leave Lebanon -- where the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based -- and airlines cancelled flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing this week of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, hours after the Israeli assassination of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran and the so-called "axis of resistance".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran-backed groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel on Saturday again traded fire with Hezbollah, carried out a deadly raid in the occupied West Bank, and struck a school compound in Gaza City in an attack that the Hamas-ruled territory's civil defence agency said killed at least 17 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Numerous schools turned into displacement shelters have been hit across Gaza in recent weeks, with Israel insisting the facilities had been used by militants. Hamas denied using civilian infrastructure for military activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh was buried on Friday in Qatar, where he had been based. Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of carrying out the attack, has not directly commented on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran said on Saturday it expects Hezbollah to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pentagon said it was bolstering its military presence in the Middle East to protect US personnel and defend Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said an aircraft carrier strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln would be deployed, as well as additional ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers and a new fighter squadron.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US President Joe Biden, at his beach home in Delaware, was asked by reporters if he thought Iran would stand down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope so," he said. "I don't know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Soon after, Hezbollah announced it had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets at the northern Israeli settlement of Beit Hillel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said it was in response to an Israeli attack on Kfar Kela and Deir Siriane in southern Lebanon which, it said, had injured civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Saturday, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its fighters, including a 17-year-old from Deir Siriane. (AFP)

    Far-right protesters clash with police in UK

    <![CDATA[<img alt="An anti-racism campaign group has identified more than 30 events planned for Saturday and Sunday. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764637_1_20240804031024.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right protesters clashed with British police during tense rallies on Saturday as unrest linked to disinformation about a mass stabbing that killed three young girls spread across the UK.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The violence, which has seen scores of arrests across England and put Britain's Muslim community on edge, presents the biggest challenge yet of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer's month-old premiership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also put hard-right agitators in the spotlight at a time when anti-immigration elements are enjoying some electoral success in British politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demonstrators threw chairs, flares and bricks at officers in the northwestern English city of Liverpool, while scuffles between police and protesters broke out in nearby Manchester.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merseyside Police said "a number of officers have been injured as they deal with serious disorder" in Liverpool city centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC reported that protesters smashed the windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants in the northeastern city of Hull. Police said three officers had been injured and four people arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Belfast, Northern Ireland, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islam group and an anti-racism rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Leeds, northern England, around 150 people carrying English flags chanted, "You're not English any more" while counter-protesters shouted "Nazi scum off our streets."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opposing groups of protesters also faced off in the central city of Nottingham and Bristol in the southwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The skirmishes marked the fourth day of unrest in several towns and cities following Monday's frenzied knife attack in Southport, near Liverpool on England's northwest coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were fuelled by false rumours on social media about the background of British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana, charged with several counts of murder and attempted murder over the attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rudakubana is accused of killing Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, and injuring another 10 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts would "face the full force of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And reacting to Saturday's clashes, he said there was "no excuse" for the violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After talks with senior ministers he "reiterated that the government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe," said a statement from his office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The violence started late on Tuesday in Southport itself, where a mob threw bricks at a mosque. That prompted hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police blamed supporters and associated organisations of the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unrest then rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later, where 111 people were arrested outside Starmer's Downing Street residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, 10 people were arrested and four officers required hospital treatment following a riot in the northeastern English city of Sunderland in which at least one car was set on fire and a shop looted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mob also torched a police station and attacked a mosque.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This was not a protest, this was unforgivable violence and disorder," Northumbria Police Chief Superintendent Mark Hall told reporters on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate has identified more than 30 events planned for Saturday and Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were advertised on far-right social media channels as "enough is enough" anti-immigration rallies. Anti-fascism groups have staged numerous counter-protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In London, demonstrators attending a regular pro-Palestinian march appeared undeterred by a separate anti-immigration protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My parents told me not to come today but I am from here. The UK is my home," said 24-year-old student Meraaj Harun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer this week announced new measures that will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour politicians have accused Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage of stoking the trouble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last month's election, his anti-immigration Reform UK party captured 14 percent of the vote – one of the largest vote shares for a far-right British party. (AFP)

    Thousands in Venezuela protest Maduro's victory claim

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado's appearance delighted the crowd. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764634_1_20240804022718.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people, led by a top opposition figure, gathered across Venezuela on Saturday to protest the widely disputed reelection of President Nicolas Maduro, as his supporters responded to his own call for competing rallies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado thrilled supporters in Caracas when she made a surprise appearance in a truck bearing a banner reading "Venezuela has won!" after spending several days in hiding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machado had backed the candidacy of Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia after she herself was banned from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Backers cried out "Freedom!" as her truck passed by on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never been so strong as today," Machado told the crowd, adding that "the regime has never been weaker... it has lost all legitimacy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro also called on his supporters to turn out for "the mother of all marches" later in the afternoon. He accused the opposition of plotting attacks against security forces during their rallies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eleven civilians reportedly have died and more than 1,000 have been detained in the protests that erupted after the country's CNE election authority, loyal to Maduro, on Friday proclaimed him the winner with 52 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Gonzalez Urrutia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that result has been rejected by countries including the United States, Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and Uruguay. They say available results show the opposition candidate to be the clear winner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has ordered the expulsion of diplomats from some countries questioning his victory. Argentine diplomats who reached Buenos Aires on Saturday said power had been cut to their embassy, as hooded police kept guard outside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 61-year-old Maduro has reacted fiercely to the widespread international criticism, describing allegations of vote fraud as a "trap" orchestrated by Washington to justify "a coup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has led the oil-rich, cash-poor country since 2013, presiding over a GDP drop of 80 percent that pushed more than seven million of once-wealthy Venezuela's 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts blame economic mismanagement and US sanctions for the collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia did not show up to a hearing at the Supreme Court after Maduro requested the tribunal investigate and certify the election result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, other opposition candidates summoned to the hearing called for a detailed vote count to be made public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opposition has launched a website with copies of 84 percent of ballots cast, showing an easy win for Gonzalez Urrutia. The government claims these are forged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Machado, who was barred from running herself, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that she was in hiding and "fearing for my life," along with other opposition leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO Foro Penal reported 11 dead in protests on Monday and Tuesday as angry Venezuelans took to the streets, and Machado said at least 20 people had been killed. Officials said one soldier died as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crackdown has sparked fear among opposition supporters, with memories still fresh of a wave of repression under the Maduro government in 2017 that left some 100 people dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have dead, wounded, detainees, missing people... People know it. They are afraid," Katiusca Camargo, an activist in the Petare slum in eastern Caracas, said on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday there was "overwhelming evidence" that Gonzalez Urrutia had won the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken spoke with Machado and Gonzalez Urrutia on Friday, expressing "his concern for their safety and well-being" and congratulating Gonzalez Urrutia "for receiving the most votes," the State Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a joint statement, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico urged an "impartial verification" of the result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro's previous reelection, in 2018, was rejected by dozens of Latin American countries as well as the United States and European Union member states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He enjoys loyalty from the military leadership, electoral bodies, courts and other state institutions, as well as the backing of Russia, China and Cuba. (AFP)

    Surging Harris, Trump spar over debate dates

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kamala Harris's campaign communications director says Donald Trump is "running scared." Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764633_1_20240804013010.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kamala Harris's campaign branded Donald Trump "scared" on Saturday after he proposed to change the presidential debate schedule ahead of a rally in Georgia where he will try to halt the vice president's surging momentum in her bid to become America's first woman president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an overnight post on his Truth Social app, Trump said he was willing to debate Harris on the conservative Fox News network on September 4, while declining to participate in a previously scheduled debate on ABC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump pitched the idea before going to a rally in Atlanta, where he will gather supporters in the same arena where Harris addressed an excited crowd of some 10,000 just this Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump said he had "agreed" to the debate plan with Fox. And he said it would take place in Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state in the US presidential electoral system – in front of a live audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris campaign dismissed this as "games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump is running scared and trying to back out of the debate he already agreed to and running straight to Fox News to bail him out," Harris's campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. "He needs to... show up to the debate he already committed to on Sept 10."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal to confront Harris on a network that has long supported him was the latest Trump effort to recapture the initiative in a campaign that had been entirely focused on a rematch against 81-year-old Joe Biden, until he dramatically dropped his reelection bid on July 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since then, Harris, 59, has reenergised the Democratic base almost overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has raked in donations, reassembled the team behind Barack Obama's two historic election victories, and neutralised the solid lead that 78-year-old Trump had built against Biden in opinion polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, she secured the official Democratic nomination, backed by near unanimous party support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris is due imminently to announce her vice presidential pick, with the popular governor of key state Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, a frontrunner. On Tuesday, she is set to launch a countrywide tour with her yet-to-be-named running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, Trump will be joined by his own vice presidential pick, Senator JD Vance, at the rally in Georgia – another battleground state that will help decide who wins the Electoral College majority on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump lost narrowly to Biden there in 2020 and the state was at the centre of his unprecedented attempts to overturn the results of the election and refusal to accept defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The size of Harris's rally on Tuesday was a warning sign to the Trump campaign, which has long touted its ability to draw thousands of passionate supporters, in contrast to Biden's usually meagre crowds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The situation is a remarkable turnaround in a campaign where Trump had been appearing to gather force while Biden – hurt by a disastrous debate performance in June and mounting voter concerns over his mental acuity – was steadily slipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris's rapid entry has left the Trump campaign scrambling – and Trump now the oldest presidential nominee in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Adding to the changed dynamics, Harris is vying to become the first woman president and the first of black and Indian bi-racial heritage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump drew gasps at a convention of black journalists this week when he claimed that Harris, who has identified closely with her black roots all her life, was only pretending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike struck a school compound in Gaza City on Saturday, killing at least 17 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are 17 martyrs and several wounded due to Israeli bombardment on Hamama school," agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said. The Israeli military confirmed the strike, saying it had hit a Hamas command and control centre located inside the compound.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bassal said the compound was housing Palestinians displaced from their homes in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said the compound was being used by Hamas militants to manufacture weapons, adding it was a "hiding place for Hamas terrorists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilian facilities as command and control centres or to hide their commanders and militants. The Palestinian group denies the accusation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, which resulted in the death of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 people, 111 of whom are still held hostage in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's withering military campaign has killed at least 39,550 people, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Flights to Beirut by Air France and low-cost carrier Transavia France will remain suspended until at least Tuesday due to "security" concerns in the region, parent company Air France-KLM said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two French airlines first stopped servicing the route on Monday, a day after Israel vowed to retaliate following rocket fire from Lebanon that killed 12 people in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any resumption of operation will be subject to a renewed evaluation on the ground," a spokesman said on Saturday, adding that passengers with reservations could rebook at no extra cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Flights to Tel Aviv will continue as normal, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rocket attack on the Golan Heights sparked fears that fighting between Hezbollah and Israel would escalate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When those fears subsided somewhat the airlines announced on Tuesday that flights would resume on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Israel then struck a Hezbollah stronghold in south Beirut on Tuesday evening, targeting a senior commander it blamed for the rocket strike on the Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This development sparked an extension of the flight suspension until Saturday, which has now been prolonged again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran said earlier on Saturday it expects the Tehran-backed Hezbollah group to hit deeper inside Israel and no longer be confined to military targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German carrier Lufthansa, meanwhile, has suspended flights until August 5. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764606_1_20240803192705.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 37 civilians were killed and more than 200 injured in an explosion on a popular beach in the Somali capital Mogadishu late on Friday evening, police said, an attack blamed by Somali state media on the militant Islamist group al Shabaab.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the deadliest attack in the Horn of Africa country since twin car bombs detonated near a busy market intersection in October 2022, killing at least 100 people and wounding 300 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate claim of responsibility by the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab, which has claimed similar attacks in the past, including the car bomb attack in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police spokesperson Abdifatah Aden gave the death toll in Friday evening's explosion at a beach restaurant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the civilians killed, Aden said that one of the attackers had blown himself up while three others had been killed by security forces. One attacker was captured alive while one soldier was killed during the assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State news agency SONNA had earlier said five al Shabaab attackers had been killed by security forces while a sixth had blown himself up during the assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hassan Farah, a survivor, described the shock as the explosion shattered a peaceful evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was in the restaurant sipping coffee and having a good chat with friends when I saw a big man running, in a second there was something like lightening and a huge blast," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were covered with smoke. Inside and outside the restaurant many people were lying on the floor while others were bleeding and crying." (Reuters)

    Vietnam names To Lam as top leader

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vietnam's Communist Party named President To Lam as the country's top leader on Saturday, after the death of his predecessor two weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "This morning, August 3, 2024, the Party Central Committee... elected To Lam the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam," the party said at a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party's general secretary is the most powerful figure in Vietnam's leadership structure, with the president occupying a largely ceremonial role that includes meeting foreign counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was unclear if Lam would continue to serve as president simultaneously or relinquish that role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first remarks as general secretary, Lam said his promotion resulted from "an urgent need to ensure the leadership of the party".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a huge honour with glorious responsibility before the party and the people," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nomination comes two weeks after the death of General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He died in the capital Hanoi "due to old age and serious illness" and Lam was informally handed the reins of power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam's formal succession to the top job follows a long career within the public security ministry. (AFP)

    Kim Jong-un hits out at Seoul over flooding reports

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Seoul on Thursday said it was willing to "urgently provide" humanitarian assistance to "North Korean disaster victims". Photo: Shutterstock' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764563_1_20240803101908.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un accused South Korean media outlets of spreading rumours about flood damage and casualties in his country, state media said on Saturday, days after Seoul reached out to offer humanitarian aid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  North Korea said earlier this week there had been unspecified casualties resulting from the flooding in its northern regions, in addition to damage to thousands of homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul on Thursday said it was willing to "urgently provide" humanitarian assistance to "North Korean disaster victims" following a South Korean news report that the toll of dead and missing could be as high as 1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by TV Chosun, which was later picked up by other outlets, also reported on the possible death of rescue workers killed in helicopter crashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But North Korea's Kim slammed the reports for "spreading the false rumour that the human loss ... is expected be over 1,000 or 1,500", according to Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim "bitterly censured the inveterate habits and despicable nature of the ROK scum," referring to South Korea, KCNA said Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The flooding reports constituted a South Korean "smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish" the North's image, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang said on Wednesday that officials who neglected their disaster prevention duties had caused unspecified casualties, without specifying the location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said on Saturday that there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said suffered the "greatest flood damage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter "within a few hours".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, but South Korea's unification and foreign ministries this week expressed condolences for the North's flood victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul said on Friday it had received no response after trying to offer humanitarian aid via the Koreas' liaison office communication channel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea declared the South its principal enemy earlier this year, and Pyongyang has not responded to inter-Korean liaison hotline calls since April 2023. (AFP)

    Violence flares in UK city as police brace for more

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Protests and counter-protests are expected across the UK this weekend. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764534_1_20240803052752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rioting flared late on Friday in Sunderland, northeast England, where police said officers were subjected to "serious violence," the latest unrest following a mass stabbing earlier this week that killed three young girls.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage shared on social media and broadcast by the BBC showed a mob of several hundred rampaging in Sunderland's city centre, attacking police and setting fire to at least one car.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as police nationwide prepared for planned far-right rallies and other demonstrations this weekend, after two nights of unrest in several English towns and cities in the wake of Monday's knife attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  London's Metropolitan Police said it had a "proportionate and risk-based" plan for rival pro-Palestinian and anti-immigration protests on Saturday. Late on Wednesday, its officers arrested 111 people as a rally in Westminster turned violent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Friday night's disturbances in Sunderland were an ominous sign for the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our officers are continuing to deal with ongoing disorder and have been subjected to serious violence," Northumbria Police said of the situation there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scenes that we are seeing are completely unacceptable," it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regional mayor Kim McGuinness said she was "appalled" at the fresh eruption of violence, this time in the northeast, which followed a calm night on Thursday across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If your response to tragedy is to use it to commit violence, to abuse others, attack the police and damage property you stand for nothing except thuggery," she said on X, echoing comments by Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Merseyside Police said extra officers had been deployed in and around Liverpool city centre "to help prevent disorder or criminality" there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed social media reports of planned far-right gatherings and counter-protests in the northwest English city, which lies close to the seaside town of Southport where Monday's knife attack occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Far-right elements have been blamed for the disturbances in the aftermath of the stabbing spree targeting children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have said online misinformation about the British-born 17-year-old suspect Axel Rudakubana has helped fuel the unrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He faces murder and attempted murder charges over the stabbing rampage that also left five children and two adults critically wounded and which has shocked Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police have said the case is not being treated as terror-related but have not revealed a motive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anger over the tragedy has fused with growing anti-immigration sentiment on the right of English politics, pushed by openly Islamophobic far-right figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After violence in Southport late on Tuesday, unrest rocked the northern cities of Hartlepool and Manchester as well as London 24 hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Southport, the mob targeted a mosque, prompting hundreds of Muslim places of worship across the country to step up security amid fears of more anti-Islamic demonstrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faith leaders says mosques have been hiring paid security staff and checking their CCTV cameras are working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Muslim community is deeply anxious right now," said Zara Mohammed, secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has accused "thugs" of "hijacking" the nation's grief to "sow hatred" and pledged that anyone carrying out violent acts will "face the full force of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In power for less than a month, the prime minister met on Friday with local leaders in Southport to discuss "a package of support for the local community," his Downing Street office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer's visit came the day after he announced a new "national capability" to tackle disorder in the wake of the recent disturbances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new measures will allow the sharing of intelligence, wider deployment of facial-recognition technology and criminal behaviour orders to restrict troublemakers from travelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police nationwide were mobilising for trouble this weekend, after far-right social media channels advertised "enough is enough" anti-immigrant rallies and anti-facism groups vowed to stage counter-protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enough is enough" has emerged as a rallying online slogan for the far-right and others following Monday's attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Yorkshire police said on Friday it knew of a planned protest in the town of Rotherham and that people might see "an increased police presence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers in south Wales said a policing operation would be in place for events being planned for Saturday in Cardiff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police in Northern Ireland noted social media posts calling for roadblocks "using women and children," as well as a march to an Islamic centre in Belfast on Saturday. (AFP)

    Judge suspends Justin Timberlake's NY driver's licence

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Timberlake made a virtual court appearance on Friday in his drunken driving case on Long Island, saying little during the brief proceeding as a judge accepted his not-guilty plea and suspended his right to drive in New York.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police in the seaside village of Sag Harbor arrested Timberlake June 18 after they say he ran a stop sign, veered out of his lane and got out of his BMW smelling of alcohol.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former NSYNC singer, who is on tour in Europe, wasn't required by the court to return to the US for his court date. He is performing on Saturday night in Antwerp, Belgium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His attorney, Edward Burke Jr, has maintained that Timberlake was not drunk and that the case should be dropped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The facts remain he was not intoxicated,” Burke said on Friday, according to Newsday. “I’ll say it again: Justin Timberlake was not intoxicated and we’re very confident that charge, that criminal charge, will be dismissed.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sag Harbor Village Justice Carl Irace suspended Timberlake's Tennessee driver's licence in New York state and threatened to impose a gag order on Burke, saying the attorney's comments to the media have been inappropriate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irace set a next court date for August 9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake had appeared in court in person previously but his arraignment needed to be repeated because of a paperwork oversight. Burke said the original charging document lacked a police sergeant’s signature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant District Attorney Ashley Cangro said new documents were filed July 2 to address that flaw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake was pulled over after leaving a Sag Harbor hotel around 12:30 am, according to police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “His eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odour of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot and he performed poorly on all standardised field sobriety tests,” police said in a court filing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timberlake, 43, told the officer he had had one martini and was following some friends home, according to police. He was arrested and spent the night in custody at a police station. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris effectively secured the Democratic party's presidential nomination on Friday, confirming her remarkable rise to party standard bearer in November's showdown against Republican Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Harris was the sole candidate on the ballot for a five-day electronic vote of nearly 4,000 party convention delegates. She will be officially crowned at a Chicago convention later this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am honoured to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States," Harris, 59, said on a phone-in to a party celebration after securing enough votes by the second day of the marathon vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the two weeks since President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid, Harris has gained full control of the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No other Democrats stepped forward to challenge her elevation to the top of the ticket, making her confirmation as the first black and south Asian woman ever to secure a major party's nomination a formality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement came with Harris preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for a swing across seven crucial battleground states with her newly minted running mate – who is expected to be revealed within days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Democratic Party decided on a virtual nomination process – mirroring the pandemic-hit 2020 vote – because of Ohio's August 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The virtual roll call marks the official beginning of the 2024 convention, although in practice the festivities really get going when thousands of party faithful descend on Chicago on August 19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will feature ceremonial votes for Harris and her running mate in what is expected to be a raucous celebration of her rise from state politics to the top of the ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's White House bid was thrown into chaos on July 21 when Biden, 81, withdrew his candidacy, backing Harris as the Democratic nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice president has already smashed fundraising records, packed arenas and wiped out Trump's polling leads over Biden, creating momentum that she hopes she can ride through the convention to the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is set to make her first public appearance with her running mate on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – a crucial swing state whose Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is among a handful candidates being vetted to potentially join the Harris ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The swing will take Harris through all the "blue wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where she will seek to rebuild the coalition that carried Biden to victory in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she will extend the tour to the much more racially diverse Sun Belt and southern states of Georgia, North Carolina Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada as she seeks to shore up the black and Hispanic vote that had been peeling away from the Democrats. (AFP)

    Weak jobs data sparks worries about US economy

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data shows US unemployment edging up to 4.3 percent. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764508_1_20240803000230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with sustained higher interest rates taking a toll on businesses and consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Friday’s report from the US Labor Department showed that employers added just 114,000 jobs in July – 35 percent fewer than forecasters had expected – and that unemployment, now up to 4.3 percent, was the highest since October 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Things are deteriorating quickly,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job marketplace ZipRecruiter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news shook financial markets around the world, with the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq both dropping sharply at the open of trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sturdiness of the US economy — the world’s largest — has been a key driver of global economic growth and the US jobs market is a big reason for it, underpinning the American expansion and giving consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unemployment rate's jump to 4.3 percent in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signalled that the United States is in recession — though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the topsy-turvy post-pandemic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The weak jobs report came two days after the Federal Reserve said it would hold off on cutting interest rates until it sees more evidence that inflation is continuing to move down and closer to its 2 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterised the American job market as healthy, despite growing calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high, to pre-empt a major weakening of the US economy and job market. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mourners and supporters bid farewell on Friday in Qatar to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh after his killing in Tehran, blamed on Israel, has heightened regional tensions as the Gaza war dragged on.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of people gathered at the Gulf emirate's largest mosque, where Haniyeh's casket, draped in a Palestinian flag, was taken before leaving again for burial in Lusail, north of Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh, the Palestinian armed group's political chief, played a key role in mediated talks aimed at ending nearly 10 months of war between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His killing triggered calls for revenge and raised questions about the continued viability of such negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mourners lined up for funeral prayers inside Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab Mosque, while others prayed on mats outside in temperatures that reached 44 degrees Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ceremony ended in angry chants, but the short-lived demonstration quickly dispersed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was a symbol, a resistance leader... people are angry," said Taher Adel, 25, a Jordanian student residing in the Qatari capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's predecessor Khaled Meshaal spoke at the ceremony, saying the slain leader had "served his cause, his people... and never abandoned them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey and Pakistan announced a day of mourning on Friday to honour Haniyeh, while Hamas called for a "day of furious rage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan were among the officials at the funeral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ismail Hanyieh is a symbol for all Muslims," said Qatari Ahmed Mahmoud, 48, at the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There must be a reaction. Israel must know we will defend ourselves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the president of the United Arab Emirates, said his country – which in 2020 normalised ties with Israel – rejects "violence and political assassination in all its forms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Doha mourners wore scarves that combined the Palestinian flag with a checkered keffiyeh pattern and the message in English: "Free Palestine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh and a bodyguard were killed in a pre-dawn "hit" on their accommodation in Tehran on Wednesday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said. Haniyeh was in Iran to attend the swearing-in of President Masoud Pezeshkian a day earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel, accused by Hamas, Iran and others of the attack, has not directly commented on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The killing of Qatar-based Haniyeh is among several incidents since April that have sent regional tensions soaring during the Gaza war, which has drawn in Iran-backed armed groups in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian officials met with representatives of these groups on Wednesday to discuss the next steps, said a source close to Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two scenarios were discussed: a simultaneous response from Iran and its allies or a staggered response from each party," said the source who had been briefed on the meeting and requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met with his visiting British counterpart John Healey on Friday and stressed "the importance of establishing a coalition" to support "Israel's defence against Iran and its proxies," Gallant's office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France urged its nationals visiting Iran to leave "due to the increased risk of a military escalation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the Gaza war, Hezbollah and Israeli forces have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire, and did so again on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Gaza, the civil defence agency reported several people killed in the territory's north, and Israel's military said it had killed around 30 militants near Rafah, in the south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's assassination came hours after Israel struck a southern suburb of Beirut, killing Fuad Shukr, the military commander of Lebanese Hamas ally Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh's deputy, Saleh al-Aruri, was killed in Beirut early this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another high-profile killing, Israel's army on Thursday confirmed that an air strike in July killed Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel "delivered crushing blows to all our enemies," said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in retaliation for its October 7 attack that ignited the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign against Hamas has killed at least 39,480 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers for Haniyeh in Tehran, having earlier threatened "harsh punishment" for his killing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York Times, citing Middle Eastern officials, has reported that Haniyeh was killed by an explosive device planted weeks ago at a Tehran guesthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the report, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told journalists "there was no other Israeli aerial attack... in all the Middle East" on the night of Shukr's killing in Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said Shukr's assassination – for which Hezbollah said retaliation was "inevitable" – was a response to rocket fire which killed 12 youths last week in the annexed Golan Heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iranian news agency Fars said the US report was a "lie," insisting that the Hamas leader was killed by a "projectile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analyst Hugh Lovatt said Haniyeh's killing at the very least "will mean that a ceasefire deal with Israel is now totally off of the table."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said US President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu by telephone on Thursday and affirmed his commitment to defend Israel's security "against all threats from Iran."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have the basis for a ceasefire (in Gaza)... They should move on it now," Biden told reporters after the call. (AFP)

    Row over Olympic boxing gender scandal deepens

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei in action with Sitora Turdibekova of Uzbekistan. She is one of two athletes at the centre of a brewing controversy at the Olympics over gender. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764500_1_20240802224116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The double world champion from Chinese Taipei, Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the heart of a gender row, won her featherweight round of 16 bout against Uzbekistan's Sidora Turdibekova on points by unanimous decision at the Paris Olympics on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old Lin, along with Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who won her round of 16 welterweight fight on Thursday against Italy's Angela Carini in 46 seconds, have been in the spotlight of the gender row after being cleared to compete in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both had been disqualified at the 2023 World Championships after failing International Boxing Association (IBA) eligibility rules that prevent athletes with male XY chromosomes competing in women's events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is overseeing the boxing tournament in Paris, has cleared the boxers to compete in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IBA said in a statement the athletes "did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognised test."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the "specifics" of this test "remain confidential", the IBA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the Olympic body's eligibility criteria was based on the gender indicated on the boxers' passports, but acknowledged that it's "not a black and white issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Neither Lin nor Khelif is known to identify as transgender and both competed at the Tokyo Games in 2021 in the women's competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The row has expanded outside the ring, with politicians and celebrities weighing in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the Khelif-Carini fight was "not on an equal footing", after the Italian fighter was left with a badly hurt nose and in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US presidential candidate Donald Trump declared on his Truth Social network that he would keep "men out of women's sports".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate JD Vance described Thursday's one-sided bout between Khelif-Carini as a "grown man pummelling a woman in a boxing match", adding: "This is disgusting, and all of our leaders should condemn it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Potter author JK Rowling said on X, formerly Twitter, that the Paris Games would be "forever tarnished by the brutal injustice done to Carini". (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US journalist Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan are expected to be released by Russia as part of one of the biggest East-West prisoner swaps since the Cold War, according to US media on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  CNN and other US networks reported the news, with ABC News reporting that the swap involved numerous countries and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no immediate confirmation from US officials. The Kremlin declined to comment on any exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still have no comment on this topic," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich, 32, was detained in March 2023 and convicted in July on spying charges in a fast-track trial denounced as a sham by the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signs of an imminent prisoner swap had picked up momentum on Thursday, amid reports a plane used in a previous exchange deal had landed in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hopes had also risen in recent days days after a number of high-profile prisoners in Russia, including Whelan, went missing from prisons where they were serving long terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those expected to be returned to Russia in exchange is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian citizen imprisoned in Germany for killing a former Chechen rebel commander in a brazen assassination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exchange would be a victory for US President Joe Biden, whose vice president, Kamala Harris, faces Republican Donald Trump in the November election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would be the first prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since star US basketball player Brittney Griner was swapped in return for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022. (AFP)

    Trump queries whether Kamala Harris is really black

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Donald Trump has accused his Democratic rival of happening to "turn black". Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764147_1_20240801033646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has questioned whether Democrat Kamala Harris is really black or is using race as a political convenience in an interview that sent shockwaves through the 2024 presidential contest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black," Trump told a panel of interviewers at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And now she wants to be known as black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?" he said of Harris, who is the first black, female, and South-Asian-heritage vice president in US history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I respect either one but she obviously doesn't, because she was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn, and she became a black person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The provocative comments by the Republican presidential nominee were the latest in a stream of ratcheted up personal attacks by the 78-year-old on Harris, and follow his multiple remarks this week in which he accused Harris -- who is married to a Jewish-American -- of being anti-Semitic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden's White House swiftly responded to Trump's comments, calling them "insulting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify," White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the first black woman to hold the position, told reporters. (AFP)

 Organisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with great joy that we received this news," Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, said. "Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five women representing 34 countries and regions will kick off the contest at 2pm Hong Kong time, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Jason Ng will participate in the men's event, which begins at 4.45pm, immediately after the women's race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The results of the latest water analyses...have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place," Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris has spent US$1.52 billion of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, the Palestinian militant group and Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said in separate statements on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian’s swearing in ceremony on Tuesday. The Guards said the attack was under investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Early this morning, the residence of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran was struck, resulting in his and one of his body guards' martyrdom. The cause is under investigation and will be announced soon," the Revolutionary Guards said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Islamist faction, Hamas, mourned the death of Haniyeh, who it said was killed in "a treacherous Zionist raid on his residence in Tehran".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts on Iranian state television immediately began blaming Israel for the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israel had vowed to kill Haniyeh and other leaders of Hamas over the group’s October 7 attack on the country that killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel itself did not immediately comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Israel's war with Hamas since the October attack, more than 39,360 Palestinians have been killed and more than 90,900 wounded, according to health authorities in Gaza. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli military said its fighter jets "eliminated" Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in the area of Beirut on Tuesday, accusing him of being responsible for a rocket strike on the annexed Golan Heights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israeli air force fighter jets eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist organisation's most senior military commander and the head of its strategic unit, Fuad Shukr, in the area of Beirut," the military said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fuad Shukr was the commander responsible for the Majdal Shams massacre, in which 12 children were murdered after Hezbollah fired an Iranian Falaq-1 rocket directly at a soccer field in northern Israel on Saturday evening," military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a separate video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fuad Shukr was the right-hand man to Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader and his advisor in planning and directing attacks and operations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hagari said Shukr was a "senior terrorist who has the blood of Israelis and many others on his hands".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the Gaza war, Shukr directed Hezbollah's attacks on Israel, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets and UAVs, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said that in the 1990s the Hezbollah commander was "directly involved" in the abduction of the bodies of three Israeli soldiers -- Benyamin Avraham, Adi Avitan and Omar Sawaid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three were killed by Hezbollah while patrolling the security fence adjacent to Har Dov, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since then, he has planned and directed numerous terror attacks against innocent civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Israel wanted to end hostilities without any wider war with Hezbollah, its forces were ready for "any scenario," Hagari said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah's ongoing aggression and brutal attacks are dragging the people of Lebanon and the entire Middle East into a wider escalation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we prefer to resolve hostilities without a wider war, the IDF (Israeli army) is fully prepared for any scenario." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Landslides in India triggered by pounding monsoon rains struck tea plantations and killed at least 108 people on Tuesday, with at least 250 others rescued from mud and debris, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The southern coastal state of Kerala has been battered by torrential downpours, with blocked roads into the disaster area in Wayanad district complicating relief efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "93 dead bodies have been found so far," Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters. "This is one of the worst natural calamities that our state has seen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 128 people had been hospitalised for treatment after their rescue, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wayanad is famed for the tea estates that crisscross its hilly countryside and which rely on a large pool of casual labourers for planting and harvest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several estates in the district were hit by two successive landslides before dawn when most of their inhabitants were asleep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images published by the National Disaster Response Force showed rescue crews trudging through mud to search for survivors and carry bodies on stretchers out of the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Homes were caked with brown sludge as the force of the landslide scattered cars, corrugated iron and other debris around the disaster site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army said it had deployed more than 200 soldiers to the area to assist state security forces and fire crews in search-and-rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kerala state excise minister M.B. Rajesh said more than 250 people had been rescued so far, The Hindu newspaper reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Modi's office said families of victims would receive a compensation payment of US$2,400.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More rainfall and strong winds were forecast in Kerala on Tuesday, the state's disaster management agency said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Early morning landslides in India triggered by pounding monsoon rains have killed at least 10 people with hundreds more feared trapped under the earth, officials said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The southern coastal state of Kerala has been battered by torrential downpours, and the collapse of a key bridge at the disaster site in Wayanad district has hampered rescue efforts, according to local media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 10 have been confirmed dead so far, a district official in Wayanad told AFP on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's army said it had deployed more than 200 soldiers to the area to assist state security forces and fire crews in search and rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hundreds of people are suspected to have been trapped," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had assured the Kerala government of "all possible help" with the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured," he said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More rainfall and strong winds were forecast in Kerala on Tuesday, the state's disaster management agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who until recently represented Wayanad in parliament, said he was "deeply anguished" by the disaster. "I hope those still trapped are brought to safety soon," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they also bring destruction every year in the form of landslides and floods. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World Triathlon on Tuesday said the Paris Olympics men's triathlon event will be postponed by a day, after tests showed the water quality in the River Seine was not up to standard.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The development means Hong Kong's Jason Ng is now scheduled to compete on Wednesday at 4.45pm. He was originally going to race at 2pm on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The tests carried out in the Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held," World Triathlon said in a statement, adding the International Olympic Committee, Meteo France and Paris officials were involved in conducting the water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately, meteorological events beyond our control, such as the rain which fell over Paris on 26 and 27 July, can alter water quality and compel us to reschedule the event for health reasons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's triathlon event will also take place on Wednesday, with World Triathlon saying both events are subject to future water tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Paris based hydrologist had earlier told RTHK that rainstorms in the 24 hours before a swimming event in the Seine could wash storm water off the land surfaces around the city, bringing pollution with it.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former British TV news presenter Huw Edwards, a household name in Britain, has been charged with three counts of making indecent pictures of children, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edwards, 62, was the BBC's highest paid news presenter and anchored the broadcaster's "BBC News at Ten" bulletin for more than two decades. He resigned in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been charged with three counts of making an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child relating to images found on a child's phone, according to court documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat," a London police spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Edwards was arrested on 8 November, 2023. He was charged on Wednesday, 26 June following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was bailed to appear at London's Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwards was one of the main faces at the BBC until his departure, announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation, and leading coverage of the biggest events in Britain since the turn of the century, including elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He quit on medical advice after allegations emerged that he had paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edna O'Brien, the radical Irish writer whose groundbreaking first novel "The Country Girls" was burned and banned in her native country, has died, her publisher announced on Sunday. She was 93.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She died peacefully on Saturday 27 July after a long illness," said a statement from publishers Faber Books posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faber called her "one of the greatest writers of our age."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish President Michael D Higgins said he had learned of the death of his "dear friend" O'Brien with "great sorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was "one of the outstanding writers of modern times" and "a fearless teller of truths," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "While the beauty of her work was immediately recognised abroad, it is important to remember the hostile reaction it provoked among those who wished for the lived experience of women to remain far from the world of Irish literature, with her books shamefully banned upon their early publication."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The honours she eventually received from her native Ireland included the Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Country Girls" (1960), about the sexual initiation of rebellious Catholic girls, drawn from O'Brien's childhood experiences, is now a marker in modern Irish literature for its breaking of social and sexual taboos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Brien was born in 1930 into a strict Catholic farming family in west Ireland's County Clare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was educated at a convent school and then in Dublin where she graduated with a pharmacist's licence in 1950, around the time she was discovering a passion for Leo Tolstoy, F Scott Fitzgerald and TS Eliot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2018, she won the prestigious PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, honoured for having broken down "social and sexual barriers for women in Ireland and beyond."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2021, France made her a Commander in the "Ordre des Arts et des Lettres," the nation's highest cultural distinction. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The wildfires that destroyed nearly a third of the beloved tourist town of Jasper in western Canada are now under control, but firefighters are still battling other nearby blazes that could go on for months, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fires, touched off on Monday by lightning strikes in a drought-stricken area, are the biggest to hit the vast Jasper National Park in a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 30 percent of the structures in the town of Jasper – a popular tourist destination considered a scenic "jewel" of the Canadian Rockies – have been destroyed, though no deaths have been reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are anticipating that all remaining fires within the townsite will be extinguished today," Parks Canada, the government agency that manages the country's national parks, said on Sunday on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 25,000 residents and tourists were evacuated from Jasper beginning late on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parks Canada said teams working in Jasper on Sunday were continuing to secure the town's perimeter to prevent new outbreaks and protect critical infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters – their numbers bolstered by some 400 colleagues from New Zealand, Mexico and South Africa – were using a helicopter to spot and extinguish any flare-ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the town and the national park remain under evacuation orders. Royal Canadian Mounted Police are patrolling the area, limiting access to "incident staff and critical contractors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town will be reopened only "when the risk of wildfire activity is significantly reduced," Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Landon Shepherd, an agency official, said bringing the fire under control throughout the national park would "not be easy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) of forestland have gone up in smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout Alberta, 135 wildfires remained active on Sunday, about a quarter of them deemed out of control, Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 185 miles (300 kilometres) to the south of Jasper, in British Columbia province, residents of Slocan, a village of some 600 houses, have also had to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As in the United States, Canada's western region has been hard-hit by wildfires this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Repeated heat waves and dry conditions, both likely linked to global climate change, are believed to be key factors, scientists say. (AFP)

    Hezbollah evacuates positions ahead of expected attack

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah has evacuated positions in south and east Lebanon after Israeli threats of reprisals for a deadly strike on the annexed Golan Heights, a source close to the group said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to "hit the enemy hard" a day after rocket fire from Lebanon killed 12 young people in Majdal Shams, again raising fears that the war in Gaza will spread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah movement for firing a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket but the Iran-backed group – which has regularly targeted Israeli military positions – said it had "no connection" to the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah has evacuated some positions in the south and in the Bekaa valley that it thinks could be a target for Israel," the source close to the group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has a strong presence in east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, which borders Syria, and in south Lebanon, from where it has been launching near daily attacks on Israeli positions since October in support of ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cross-border exchanges of fire have largely been limited to the border area, but Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside Lebanon, including overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah is also deployed in Syria, where for years it has been fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said pro-Iran groups and Hezbollah-affiliated fighters have "evacuated their positions" south of the capital and in the Damascus countryside, as well as in parts of the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights, in anticipation of "potential Israeli airstrikes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah had already abandoned positions in Syria in early June after Israeli raids, according to the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters, including from Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raids also seek to cut off Hezbollah supply routes to Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's raids on Syria intensified after Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip, then eased after an April 1 strike blamed on Israel hit the Iranian consular building in Damascus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That strike prompted Iran to launch a first-ever direct missile and drone attack against Israel on April 13-14, sending regional tensions skyrocketing. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans booed a Dutch beach volleyball player convicted of raping an underage girl as he played his first match at the Paris Olympics, where his controversial selection has put the sport in the spotlight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven van de Velde, now 29, was convicted in 2016 of raping an underage girl and sentenced to four years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He walked onto centre court Sunday with teammate Matthew Immers on Sunday morning to cheers and applause, with many orange-clad Dutch fans standing to clap the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he was introduced individually over the loudspeaker, however, there was a loud chorus of boos from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also sporadic boos as he served throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player has won the backing of his country's national Olympic committee, and exchanged a warm hug with teammate Immers before the start of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his selection has drawn outrage among women's and sports safety groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the player would be separated from his teammates, not stay in the athletes' village, and forbidden from speaking to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His teammate Immers told reporters after the match that they had been "disappointed" by all the focus on van de Velde's past conviction, particularly after a "hard fight" to qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know the guy for two, three years together and we played every tournament," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me that's a big example that you grew, you learned a lot from it. What happened in the past... it's not good of course. But right now we are trying to enjoy and go to the next round," Immers added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ju'Riese Colon, chief executive of the US-based Center for SafeSport, said she was "deeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate" in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With teams from around the world convening in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety," she said. (AFP)

    Tense Venezuela votes in shadow of 'bloodbath' warning

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Incumbent Nicolas Maduro has warned of a "bloodbath" if he loses. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763576_1_20240728223317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelans voted on Sunday between continuity in President Nicolas Maduro or change in rival Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia amid high tension following the incumbent's threat of a "bloodbath" if he loses, which polls suggest is likely.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With several international observers blocked from entering the South American country at the last minute, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for all parties to "respect the democratic process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Venezuelan people deserve an election that genuinely reflects their will, free from any manipulation. The international community is going to be watching this very closely," Blinken told reporters in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long queues of voters formed at several voting stations hours before polls opened at 6:00 am (1000 GMT). Polls close at 6:00 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have been here since 4:30 in the morning, and I hope it will be a successful day," lawyer Griselda Barroso, 54, said in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope there is democracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro, 61, is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is seeking a third six-year term at the helm of the once wealthy petro-state that saw GDP drop 80 percent in a decade, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a message published on social media overnight, Maduro urged Venezuelans to "Vote, vote, vote, and peace will triumph."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia, a 74-year-old former diplomat, called on his compatriots to turn out in large numbers "to transform your future" in what "will undoubtedly be the most important democratic expression of the people in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope and wish that everything will transpire in peace," he said in a video posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro lags far behind Gonzalez Urrutia in voter intention, according to independent polls, but counts on a loyal electoral machinery, military leadership and state institutions in a system of well-established political patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relying on its own figures, the government is also said to be certain of victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls suggest Sunday's vote poses the biggest threat yet to 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Maduro's predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chavez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts say the president is unlikely to concede defeat, especially in the absence of immunity guarantees, with his government under investigation for human rights abuses by the International Criminal Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Days before the vote, Maduro said the outcome would decide whether Venezuela enters a period of "peace or war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they do not want Venezuela to become a bloodbath, a fratricidal civil war produced by the fascists, let us guarantee the greatest success, the greatest electoral victory of our people," he said at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments drew condemnation from leaders including Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said: "Maduro has to learn: if you win, you stay. If you lose, you go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns were further stoked when Caracas blocked several international observers, including four ex-presidents who had their plane held up in Panama on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, a Venezuelan NGO said the government was holding 305 "political prisoners" and had arrested 135 people with links to the opposition campaign since January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caracas accuses the opposition of conspiring against Maduro, whose 2018 reelection was rejected as illegitimate by most Western and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Years of tough US sanctions failed to dislodge the president, who enjoys support from Cuba, Russia and China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has repeatedly vowed that he won't cede power now even as Venezuelans clamour for change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government blames sanctions, but observers point the finger at corruption and mismanagement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 21 million Venezuelans are registered to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has deployed tens of thousands of security forces and enforced ramped-up border control and a prohibition on public gatherings and protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the election in Venezuela will hardly be free or fair, Venezuelans have their best chance in over a decade to elect their government," Human Rights Watch Americas director Juanita Goebertus said this week, urging the international community to "have their (voters') back." (AFP)

    France eyes return to normal on trains 'by Monday'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Engineers from national rail operator SNCF repair cables damaged in the attacks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763483_1_20240728042748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's national rail operator on Saturday said train travel was gradually returning to normal after multiple sabotage acts paralysed the network hours ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It remains unclear who carried out the three attacks overnight Thursday to Friday on rail infrastructure and if they were deliberately timed to disrupt the Olympics opening ceremony that took place later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a message of support for the sabotage was sent to several media outlets on Saturday, which also criticised the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of rail passengers struggled through a second day of cancelled and delayed trains on Saturday with 160,000 of the 800,000 people due to travel on a major holiday getaway weekend still facing cancellations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said national rail operator SNCF had mobilised a hundred workers overnight to repair the damage "in difficult weather conditions" and ensure a return to normal for Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the night, "with floodlights, in the rain, they patched up the wires one by one," said SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything will be repaired by Monday morning" on the SNCF network, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fibre optic cables running near the tracks and ensuring the transmission of safety information for drivers, such as signalling lights and points, were cut and set on fire during the night from Thursday to Friday on three of the main TGV lines, in the west, north and east of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No claim of responsibility has been made for the meticulously planned night-time attacks. Maintenance workers thwarted a fourth attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a statement sent to several news media expressed support for the sabotage and criticised the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They call it a festival? We see it as a celebration of nationalism, a gigantic stating of the subjugation of populations by states," said the email received by the newspaper La Provence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the headline of the message said, "claim to sabotage," no details of the action were provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was signed by "an unexpected delegation" and was sent via the online platform Riseup, whose users include those advocating for social change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris prosecutors on Friday opened a probe into an attack on "fundamental national interests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observers have noted that the nature of the attacks indicate the culprits would have needed deep knowledge of the functioning of the railways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the investigation was progressing, as he also expressed "relief" that the opening ceremony had taken place without any mishap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have uncovered a certain number of elements that allow us to think that we will soon know who is responsible for what clearly did not sabotage the Olympic Games but did sabotage part of the holidays of the French people," Darmanin told France 2 television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was "too early" to say who was behind the attack. "It could have come from inside (France) or from the outside."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities are on high alert for a terrorist attack during the Games, which run through August 11. Tens of thousands of police and troops are on security duties during the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 250,000 people missed their train on Friday, according to SNCF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three out of every 10 trains were cancelled on Saturday in the three regions affected by the attacks, with most trains still operating delayed by between one and two hours, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly one third of trains were cancelled in northern, western and eastern France. About a quarter of Eurostar high speed trains between Paris and London and Paris and Brussels were also called off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With normal services set to be fully restored on Monday, the situation is already expected to improve markedly on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine out of 10 TGV high speed trains will be able to run on the western and southwestern lines on Sunday, while service will be more patchy in the north, where seven out of 10 trains are due to run, SNCF said. Trains to eastern France have not been affected. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA deducted six points from Canada in the Paris Olympics women’s football tournament and banned three coaches for one year each on Saturday in a drone spying scandal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The stunning swath of punishments include a US$226,000 fine for the Canadian soccer federation in a case that has spiraled at the Summer Games. Two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand’s practices before their opening game last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Bev Priestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, already was suspended by the national soccer federation then removed from the Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priestman and her two assistants implicated in the case, Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander, are now banned from all soccer for one year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA fast-tracked its own disciplinary process by asking its appeals judges to handle the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA judges found Priestman and her two assistants “were each found responsible for offensive behavior and violation of the principles of fair play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Canadian federation was held responsible for not ensuring its staff complied with tournament rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coaches and the Canadian federation now can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport's special Olympic court in Paris. That tribunal is set up for urgent hearings and verdicts at the Olympics. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 11 people were killed in a rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, Israeli Channel 13 reported, amid an escalation of fire between Israel and armed groups in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli emergency service said earlier that 11 people were critically wounded by a rocket fired from Lebanon that hit a village football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams. A medic described great destruction and fire at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However senior Hezbollah media representative Mohammad Afif denied responsibility for the strike on Majdal Shams.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register on Saturday after South Korea dropped earlier objections to its listing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sado gold and silver mines, now a popular tourist attraction, are believed to have started operating as early as the 12th century and produced until after World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan had put a case for World Heritage listing because of their lengthy history and the artisanal mining techniques used there at a time when European mines had turned to mechanisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal was opposed by Seoul when it was first put because of the use of involuntary Korean labour during World War II, when Japan occupied the Korean peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But South Korea's foreign ministry said it had agreed to the listing "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unesco confirmed the listing at its ongoing committee meeting in New Delhi after a bid highlighting the archaeological preservation of "mining activities and social and labour organisation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The inscription was the result of a 14-year effort," Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to share this joy with local people as well as all Japanese citizens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan had reiterated a pledge to keeping the memories alive of "the harsh labour conditions of all workers," the foreign ministry in Tokyo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that exhibits on Sado island included data showing a higher percentage of Korean labourers were engaged in dangerous underground tasks, while others fled or were detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historians have argued that recruitment conditions at the mine effectively amounted to forced labour, and that Korean workers faced significantly harsher conditions than their Japanese counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discrimination did exist," Toyomi Asano, a professor of history of Japanese politics at Tokyo's Waseda University, said in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their working conditions were very bad and dangerous. The most dangerous jobs were allocated to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sado mines were listed alongside the Beijing Central Axis, a collection of former imperial palaces and gardens in the Chinese capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 589-hectare heritage area reflects "the ancient Chinese tradition of urban planning, serving as an important emblem that highlights the distinctive characteristics of Chinese civilisation," state news agency Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other listings this week include the centuries-old, ornate burial mounds of the Ahom Dynasty in northeastern India and the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saint Hilarion complex, one of the oldest monasteries in the Middle East dating back to the fourth century, was meanwhile added to a list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Unesco committee meeting runs until Wednesday. (AFP)

    Israeli strike on Gaza school kills 30

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians inspect the damage following the Israeli strike on the Khadija school housing displaced people in Deir al-Balah. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763460_1_20240727233139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said an Israeli strike on Saturday on a school killed 30 people, after a days-long military operation further south left around 170 dead, according to the civil defence agency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Since July 6 at least eight schools – including the latest one – have been hit leaving more than 100 people dead, based on a tally of tolls given by the health ministry and a hospital source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced at least once during the war started by the October 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings including the one hit on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest strike in the Deir el-Balah city area targeted Khadija school, the health ministry said. More than 100 people were wounded, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it carried out a strike on the school targeting "terrorists" operating there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further south, in the Khan Younis city area, around 170 people have been killed "and hundreds wounded" during an Israeli operation over several days there, Gaza's Civil Defence Agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It issued the toll after the military earlier on Saturday warned of new operations in the area and issued fresh evacuation orders for residents of Khan Younis, where troops had earlier recovered the bodies of five Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egyptian state-linked media said Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators are to meet with Israeli negotiators in the Italian capital on Sunday in the latest push for a Gaza truce, which critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have accused him of blocking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said more than 180,000 Palestinians had already fled fierce fighting in Khan Younis since the military operation began almost a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evacuation orders and "intensified hostilities" have "significantly destabilised aid operations," the UN said, reporting "dire water, hygiene and sanitation conditions" in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had warned last Monday that its forces would "forcefully operate" in the Khan Younis region – from where rockets had been fired – including an area previously declared a safe humanitarian zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan Younis was left devastated after heavy fighting early in the year but the military withdrew in April saying it had "concluded its mission" there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now it has returned in force. On Wednesday the military said troops carried out an operation in Khan Younis and retrieved the bodies of five Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had been killed during the October 7 attack on Israel and their bodies taken back to Gaza, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said on Friday that its forces had "eliminated approximately 100" militants in Khan Younis during the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said the captives' bodies were pulled from underground tunnels and walls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack that began the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,258 people, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its latest toll on Saturday included 83 deaths over the previous 48 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, the military ordered residents from more parts of Khan Younis "to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi" – the second such adjustment made to the safe zone within a week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further south, in Rafah, medics said on Saturday that four people were killed and several wounded in an air strike on a house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military on Saturday said troops had targeted "military infrastructure sites" in the Rafah area and "eliminated dozens" of militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Qahera news, which has links to Egyptian intelligence, reported on Friday that talks "to reach agreement on a truce in Gaza" would take place on Sunday in Rome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US news outlet Axios separately reported that CIA Director Bill Burns was expected to hold talks in Rome with Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest mediation efforts have focused on a ceasefire and hostage-release accompanied by the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. US President Joe Biden presented the framework in late May, billing it as an Israeli proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a meeting on Thursday in Washington, Biden called on Netanyahu to "finalise" a deal and "reach a durable end to the war in Gaza," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That same day, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which has regularly protested for a deal, alleged "deliberate sabotage" of talks and demanded an urgent meeting with Israeli negotiators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their accusation came after a source with knowledge of the talks said the arrival of Israeli negotiators in Qatar had been postponed from Thursday to this coming week. (AFP)

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday called on the United States to return to a rational and pragmatic policy towards China as he urged Washington not to continue to stir up trouble in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang also urged the United States to "refrain from fanning the flames" in the territorial dispute between Beijing and the Philippines, the foreign ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US side should refrain from fanning the flames, stirring up trouble and undermining stability at sea," Wang said, according to a ministry statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Wang met with his US counterpart Antony Blinken on the sidelines of a foreign ministers meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US hailed the talks between Blinken and Wang as "open and productive" with the two sides discussing issues of mutual concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's talks lasted for one hour and twenty minutes, according to a senior US State Department official. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Olympic Committee apologised on Saturday for a gaffe during the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics in which South Korean athletes were incorrectly introduced as North Korean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the South Korean delegation sailed down the Seine river in the French capital, they were introduced with the official name for North Korea: "Republique populaire democratique de Coree" in French, then "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" in English.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We deeply apologise for the mistake that occurred when introducing the South Korean team during the broadcast of the opening ceremony," the IOC said in a post on its official Korean-language X account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The error sparked displeased reactions in South Korea, that is technically still at war with the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Korean Sport & Olympic Committee said later on Saturday that it had received a message from the IOC indicating that its chief, Thomas Bach, wished to directly apologise to the president of South Korea over the phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Korea's sports ministry said in a statement it "expresses regret" over the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second vice sports minister Jang Mi-ran, a 2008 Olympic weightlifting champion, has asked for a meeting with IOC chief Bach to discuss the matter, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's foreign ministry said in a statement it had contacted the French embassy in Seoul which expressed regret over what it said was an "incomprehensible mistake".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea was correctly introduced with the country's official name. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763379_1_20240727090641.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French rail officials warned of travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of people throughout the weekend after saboteurs following a meticulous plan paralysed much of the train network on Friday as the Olympic Games started.
 <br>
  <br/>
  No immediate claim of responsibility was made for the arson attacks on cabling boxes at junctions strategically picked out north, southwest and east of the capital where the Olympics opening ceremony was staged on Friday night. Rail workers thwarted a fourth attempt to destroy safety equipment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SNCF rail company called it a "massive attack".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilised to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts," Prime Minister Gabriel Attal posted on X, calling the attacks "prepared and coordinated acts of sabotage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Services from Paris to much of France saw mass cancellations and delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Eurostar company said it scrapped about a quarter of its trains between London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. It predicted cancelling about a fifth of trains over the weekend and all services will face delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to take a plane instead of a high speed train to the Olympics ceremony. Four special trains bringing Olympic athletes to Paris, including some US team members, went ahead, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With one of France's busiest holiday travel weekends clashing with the start of the Olympics, SNCF said about a quarter of trains will be cancelled on Saturday and Sunday on the lines attacked. Trains that run will face delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said thousands of staff worked to repair the damage and try to get services running again. It estimated that about 250,000 passengers were affected on Friday. Junior transport minister Patrice Vergriete said 800,000 could face the fallout over the three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At each site, the perpetrators targeted fibre optic cables that carry safety information for drivers and control rail changes, SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gerard Due, mayor of Croisilles in northern France, one of the sites hit, said the attackers had specialised equipment to access the cables and then "threw a flammable liquid" on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vergriete said that the saboteurs had been spotted with "vans", while "incendiary devices were found at the scene".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French security forces are on their highest alert to prevent attacks during the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron declared the Olympic Games open on Friday after a soaking wet ceremony in which athletes were cheered by the crowd along the Seine as dancers took to the roofs of Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France's three-time Olympic gold medallists Marie-Jose Perec and Teddy Riner then lit the Olympic cauldron, suspended on a hot-air balloon, before Canada's Celine Dion sang Edith Piaf's "Hymn to Love", in her first public performance in years, drawing huge cheers from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fleet of barges took the competitors on a 6 km-stretch of the river alongside some of the French capital's most famous landmarks, as performers recreated some of the sports to be showcased in the Games on floating platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time that an opening ceremony has taken place outside a stadium, adding to the headaches for a vast security operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I invite everybody: dream with us. Like the Olympic athletes, be inspired with the joy that only sport can give us. Let us celebrate this Olympic spirit of living in peace," International Olympics Committee President Thomas Bach said as the ceremony came to an end at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mix of French and international stars, including soccer great Zinedine Zidane, 14-times French Open champion Rafa Nadal, 23-times Grand Slam champion Serena Williams and three paralympic athletes were among the last torchbearers before the cauldron was lit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will blaze until the closing ceremony on August 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While rain forced some fans to leave early, those who spoke to RTHK's Hailey Yip and Kelly Yu were impressed by what they saw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought it was very beautiful," one French spectator said. "Very artistic, very creative, very French, lots of contrast, lots of great pictures, so I think it was fabulous."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, crowds cheered as the teams headed down the Seine on a series of barges. The Hong Kong, China team deployed umbrellas as heavy rain struck, with athletes including flag-bearers Siobhan Haughey and Edgar Cheung snapping selfies along the way.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's police watchdog on Friday said it had launched a criminal probe into an incident caught on video in which an officer appeared to kick and stamp on a man's head while making an arrest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Greater Manchester Police in northwest England has suspended an officer from all duties following the incident at Manchester Airport on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can confirm we are conducting a criminal investigation into the use of force during events which took place on 23 July at Manchester Airport," said Catherine Bates, regional director of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The officer involved would be formally interviewed "as soon as possible," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video, which has circulated online, caused public outrage and two nights of protests in Manchester and nearby Rochdale. The IOPC said it was looking at the "level of force" used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greater Manchester Police has said that three officers were assaulted, with one female officer "suffering a broken nose" and requiring hospital treatment, while apprehending a suspect at the airport following reports of an assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Details of what happened immediately before and after the video remain unclear. Police said the "use of such force in an arrest is an unusual occurrence and one that we understand creates alarm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said after seeing the full footage leading up to the circulated clip that it was "not a clearcut situation" and that while the clip was "disturbing," there were issues "on both sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two men were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of assault and assault of an emergency worker among other counts.

    Olympic Games a chance to 'silence the guns': Guterres

<div class="itemFullText">
 United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged countries around the world to stop armed conflict as part of the Olympic truce, with the Paris 2024 Olympics set to open later on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Guterres met International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and said the Games were a chance for peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to express the total support of the United Nations to the IOC," Guterres said. "We live in a divided world where conflicts are proliferating in a dramatic way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The horrendous suffering in Gaza, the seemingly endless war in Ukraine, terrible suffering from Sudan to the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo), from the Sahel to Myanmar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a moment like this it is important to say that the first recorded, in history, real peace initiative was the Olympic truce."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the Olympics in ancient Greece all conflicts ceased for the duration of the Games to allow for the competitions to go ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a moment in which the Olympic Games will start it is time to remind the world of the importance of the Olympic truce and to make the world understand that we must silence the guns," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Games kick off later on Friday and end on August 11 with the participation of more than 10,500 athletes representing 206 nations and territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include a Palestinian team, which while not a full member of the United Nations, has an official national Olympic Committee, as well as athletes from Russia and Belarus, who will compete as neutrals without a flag or emblem following the assault on Ukraine in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So this is the moment in which my strong appeal is for countries to come together with the same spirit as athletes will be coming together during the Olympic Games in Paris," Guterres said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladeshi police detectives on Friday forced the discharge from hospital of three student protest leaders blamed for deadly unrest, taking them to an unknown location.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Asif Mahmud, Nahid Islam and Abu Baker Majumder are all members of Students Against Discrimination, the group responsible for organising recent street rallies against civil service hiring rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 193 people were killed in the ensuing police crackdown and clashes, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, in some of the worst unrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio were being treated for injuries that they said were caused by torture in earlier police custody at a hospital in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They took them from us," Gonoshasthaya hospital supervisor Anwara Begum Lucky said. "The men were from the Detective Branch."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that she had not wanted to discharge the student leaders but police had pressured the hospital chief to do so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islam's elder sister Fatema Tasnim said from the hospital that six plainclothes detectives had taken all three men. (AFP)

    Obama endorsement adds momentum to Harris campaign

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former US president Barack Obama endorsed his fellow Democrat Kamala Harris' bid for the White House on Friday, delivering a major boost to her campaign to defeat Donald Trump in November's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's first woman vice president is seeking to make history again in November after President Joe Biden abruptly announced he would not seek re-election after weeks of mounting pressure on him to quit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barack and Michelle Obama's backing will add to the growing momentum behind Harris' campaign, with polls showing she has already narrowed the gap that existed between Trump and Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Earlier this week, Michelle and I called our friend Kamala Harris. We told her we think she'll make a fantastic President of the United States, and that she has our full support," Obama said on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this critical moment for our country, we're going to do everything we can to make sure she wins in November. We hope you'll join us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The influential former leader and first black US president was one of the last Democratic heavy hitters to offer his endorsement, with Harris having already received the backing of Biden on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, 59, jumped into the election after weeks of turmoil over 81-year-old Biden, who bowed out after a dismal debate performance against Trump accelerated concerns over his mental capacity and persistently low polling numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has since launched a blistering attack on Trump and his "extremist" Republicans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Harris addressed the American Federation of Teachers – the first union to endorse her bid – warning the country was witnessing a "full-on attack" by Trump's Republicans on "hard-won, hard-fought freedoms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Democratic Party delegates have rapidly rallied en masse behind Harris, and the momentum behind her campaign has appeared to catch Trump off guard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bombastic Republican has refused to schedule a debate with Harris, saying Thursday night it would be "inappropriate" until she was officially named the Democratic nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris, a former top prosecutor for California, chided her opponent on X, saying: "What happened to 'any time, any place?'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had previously said of a potential September 10 face-off: "I'm ready. So let's go." (AFP)

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763323_2_20240726221054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's rail network was paralysed on Friday by what authorities called coordinated acts of sabotage, which knocked out most of its high-speed train services hours before the Paris Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At Paris' Gare du Nord station, a Hongkonger living in the UK said he may have to call off his trip to Brussels because his train had been delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at the station half an hour early and saw my train was delayed for half an hour. And the train is getting delayed further. I’m afraid that it may be cancelled and my schedule will be a mess."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French rail operator SNCF said three night-time arson attacks had destroyed cabling boxes at strategic junctions around its network at locations north, south-west and east of Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fourth attempted act of vandalism south-east of the capital was thwarted by rail workers who spotted intruders in the early hours of Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our intelligence services and law enforcement are mobilised to find and punish the perpetrators of these criminal acts", Prime Minister Gabriel Attal posted on X, calling the attacks "prepared and coordinated acts of sabotage".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Olympics are set to open in a spectacular and unprecedented ceremony on the river Seine on Friday evening, with many ticket holders set to travel to the City of Light by train.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With some trains on the Eurostar network – whose routes include Paris to London – cancelled, a traveller in the UK, Saloni Modi, said she was worried she could not make the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Nervous about missing it, yes. Because it's something that we've planned and we're looking forward to, and it's almost like a once in a lifetime because you don't get to go to that all the time. So we're hoping we make it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French officials refused to comment on the identity of the culprits of the rail sabotage who appear to have had a sophisticated understanding of the network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the rail disruption, which will affect 800,000 people over the weekend, International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach told the media that he had no concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have full confidence in the French authorities," he said at the Athletes' Village.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The USA basketball team was also set to take a high-speed train to play their opening game on Sunday against Serbia in Lille, northern France. (Additional reporting by AFP and Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans from around the world gathered by the River Seine in Paris on Friday for the first-ever Olympics opening ceremony outside a stadium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens of boats were to take athletes on a 6-kilometre journey along the river, past major landmarks including the Notre Dame and the Louvre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 300,000 spectators, including VIPs and celebrities from around the world, were expected to enjoy the show from the river banks – a big difference compared to the last Olympics in Tokyo, when the Covid pandemic meant the Games opened in an empty stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A little rain in Paris didn't stop spectators from waiting along the river banks hours before the opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rebecca, a tourist from the United States, said going to the Games was on her bucket list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That's why we came, when we found out that four years ago… they were going to have their opening ceremony going down the Seine, we decided that we have to be here,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s amazing, just because you have such a beautiful city and then the Olympics, which is number one on my bucket list to go to an Olympics in what other place to be than Paris.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tight security measures were put in place to ensure safety, including restricting most of the River Seine, and requiring visitors to present a QR code.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hours before the ceremony,  France’s high-speed network was hit by arson attacks, forcing many services to be cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ed Settle from North Carolina said he was looking forward to the ceremony in spite of the trouble getting to the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will be interesting to see because it’s the first [ceremony] without the stadium, so I guess how the city can handle it but also how spectators will also be able to handle it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We just were able to find this opening here. We've been walking a little bit. Definitely can make it a little bit easier to navigate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening ceremony, from 1.30am Hong Kong time, is expected to last around four hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing champion Edgar Cheung and swimming star Siobhan Haughey are the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China delegation.

    <![CDATA[<img alt='A senior US administration official says negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the "closing stages" and that Biden would try to close some "final gaps" with Netanyahu.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday he was ready to work with Joe Biden for the rest of his presidency, as the two leaders met for the first time at the White House for talks on a Gaza ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I want to thank you for the 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel," Netanyahu said after they shook hands in the historic setting of the Oval Office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden stunned the world on Sunday when he announced that he was bowing out of the US presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris now set to be the Democratic Party's candidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu will also meet Harris separately at the White House, in a reflection of the new political reality that will see Biden as a lame duck president for his remaining six months in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Harris meeting comes amid speculation that if she wins in November it could herald a tougher approach on Israel's war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relations between Biden and Netanyahu are tense over Israel's conduct in the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attacks, but the US president has continued strong military and political support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have met just three times during his presidency, once in September last year in New York, and then when Biden travelled to Israel after the attacks and hugged Netanyahu on the airport tarmac at Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meetings come after Netanyahu vowed "total victory" against Hamas in a fiery speech Wednesday to the US Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden and Netanyahu will later meet the families of US hostages held in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House was surrounded by metal barriers and a heavy police presence, after rowdy protests broke out near the Capitol following Netanyahu's speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris on Thursday condemned the "despicable" and "unpatriotic" burning of an American flag by protesters, after attempts by Donald Trump's Republicans to paint Democrats as pro-Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a primetime speech explaining his decision on Sunday to bow out of the US presidential election, Biden made clear that resolving the conflict would remain a top priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm going to keep working to end the war on Gaza, bring home all the hostages to bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war," the US president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior US administration official said on Wednesday that negotiations on a Gaza deal were in the "closing stages" and that Biden would try to close some "final gaps" with Netanyahu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris has previously been more outspoken about Israel's conduct of the war, prompting speculation she will shift her policy as presidential nominee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US official said there was "no daylight between the president and vice president," who will meet Netanyahu at 4:30 pm (2030 GMT).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu will meet Republican contender Donald Trump on Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ex-president on Thursday morning urged Israel to quickly "finish up" its war in Gaza, warning its global image was being tarnished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has offered Israel steadfast support since October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the US president has been increasingly critical of Israel over the Palestinian death toll in its offensive in Gaza, and criticised restrictions on the amount of aid getting through to the territory, much of which has been reduced to rubble.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas attack on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures. Out of 251 people taken hostage that day, 111 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including 39 who the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 39,100 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry of Hamas-run Gaza, which does not give details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Israeli military 327 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza military campaign since the start of the ground offensive on October 27. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Paris Olympics just around the corner, the French capital is a step closer to the dream of swimming in the River Seine again, as bacteria levels go down to an acceptable level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Swimming in the iconic river has been banned since 1923, but athletes and Parisians may soon be able to take a dip thanks to cleanup efforts for the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Historically there's been pollution from industry, from farms upstream of Paris, and then from the city itself, from frankly raw sewage that goes into the river,” said Matthew Heberger, a Paris-based hydrologist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest water quality tests show that the river is mostly safe for swimming under standards set by international swimming and triathlon federations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the biggest risk, as Heberger explained, is "that if there's a large rainstorm in the 24 hours before one of the swimming events that could wash a lot of storm water off of the land surfaces around the city which brings with it pollution".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From July 30, the Seine is set to host outdoor swimming events during the Games. But the triathlon could be postponed or changed to a duathlon without swimming if the river water is unsafe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR triathlete Jason Ng is expecting to race in the river that day. But while he cannot guarantee that his event will go ahead, Ng said he will just focus on what he can control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would prefer the swim not to be cancelled as I've qualified for triathlon, and I would prefer to actually race the event that I've qualified for in the Olympics,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course having the swim cancelled will favour some athletes who are not as strong swimmers, but again I think you just have to deal with what comes.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip in the Seine in mid-July to convince doubters that the water is safe enough for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local surnamed Boutin told RTHK that he too wants to take a dip if all goes well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s going to be a new future for Paris and I think it’s going to be a good thing. It was a little browner, now it’s greenish. There’s a colour change,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And another Parisian, Kelfa, said he hopes the river will stay clean so people can swim even after the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I do believe the numbers of the studies, like they’ve been saying recently it was too high of bacteria for us to swim in it, which I do believe,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And now apparently they’ve invested a lot to clean it and the numbers are better. I guess we should trust them.”

    Natural regeneration of forests often better: study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Countries have pledged to plant billions of trees to tackle climate change, but half the time letting forests regenerate naturally would be a better option, a major study said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are places where it makes sense to plant trees, and there are places where it makes sense to naturally regenerate forests," Jacob Bukoski, one of the authors of the study told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to sequester carbon at the lowest cost, some combination of natural regeneration and plantations makes a lot of sense," said the researcher at Oregon State University in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Restoring forests has massive potential to help limit rising global temperatures because trees absorb heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study, which spanned 138 countries and was published in the journal Nature Climate Change, compared the cost and climate benefits of planting one tree species in an area or allowing natural forest regrowth -- two common reforestation approaches --- over a 30-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that in 46 percent of the studied areas, letting forests grow back naturally was the more cost-effective option. The rest of the time, plantations were found to be cheaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It suggests that the current heavier emphasis on plantations within national reforestation programmes could be leading to missed opportunities for cost-effective climate mitigation," the study said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous research has shown that as much as two-thirds of reforestation commitments in the tropics are plantations, said Bukoski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years there has been "a proliferation of single species plantations to try to meet climate goals," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-growing single species plantations -- also called monoculture -- are more costly to implement but provide revenue from the production and sale of wood products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the wood is harvested, a portion of the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere -- but the rest is trapped in the timber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naturally regenerated forests grow more slowly but are more biodiverse and store a greater amount of carbon over a longer time period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said their mapping could help guide international initiatives and countries' plans to cut emissions by presenting a more nuanced approach to reforestation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found that natural regeneration was especially cost-effective in much of western Mexico, the Andean region, the Southern Cone of South America, west and central Africa, India, southern China, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conversely, plantations proved the better option in large parts of the Caribbean, Central America, Brazil, north, east and southern Africa, northern China, mainland Southeast Asia and the Philippines. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People wait to collect food from a soup kitchen in Omdurman in Sudan. A new report from UN agencies says about 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763015_1_20240724234356.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conflict, economic turbulence and extreme weather scuppered efforts to curb hunger last year, with around nine percent of the world's population affected, UN agencies said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023, a level that has held steady for three years after a steep rise following the Covid-19 pandemic, they said in a report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the picture is uneven. While hunger affected one in every five people in Africa, compared with a global average of one in 11, Latin America and the Caribbean progressed and Asia stalled in the goal of eliminating undernourishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broader goal of securing regular access to adequate food for everyone also stalled in that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate or severe food insecurity, which forces people to occasionally skip meals, hit 2.33 billion people last year -- almost 29 percent of the global population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization suggests the UN goal of a world without hunger by 2030 is fading further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conflicts, climate chaos and economic downturns are already known as major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition that combine with underlying factors including persistent inequality, the unaffordability of healthy diets and unhealthy food environments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But these major drivers are becoming more frequent and intense -- and occurring concurrently more often -- meaning more people are exposed to hunger and food insecurity, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A healthy diet was unaffordable for more than one third of the world's population in 2022, the report added, citing updated estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here too regional inequalities were stark: more than 71 percent of people in low-income countries could not afford healthy diets, compared with just over six percent in high-income nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to David Laborde, an economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization and one of the report's authors, the post-Covid economic rebound was unequal within and between countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wars and extreme weather events also raged unabated in 2023, but the world has failed to put in place a "Marshall Plan" to bolster funds earmarked for fighting hunger, he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN agencies' report, which was presented for a G20 summit in Brazil, suggested a major reform of financing food security and nutrition to alleviate the scourge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would start with adopting common definitions putting all actors on the same page. According to current estimates, between $176 billion and $3,975 billion are needed to eradicate hunger by 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet the "highly fragmented" financial architecture "makes the scale-up and effective implementation of financing for food security and nutrition unfeasible", the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donors, international agencies, NGOs and foundations must coordinate better as the current set-up lacks shared priorities and is characterised by "an over-proliferation of actors delivering mostly small, short-term projects", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Food security and nutrition is not simply a question of "distributing bags of rice in emergency situations", Laborde said, but also aid to small-scale farmers and access to energy in rural areas that could electrify irrigation systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another weakness of the current system is that donor intentions do not always meet the needs of populations, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Debates over animal husbandry in some European countries may discourage investment in intensifying it in Africa, which is necessary, said Laborde. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepali officials said at least 18 people were killed when a small plane crashed and caught fire while it was taking off from Nepal's capital Kathmandu on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Saurya Airlines flight was carrying two crew and 17 of the company's staff members for a test flight, Nepali police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pilot has been rescued and is being treated. It is not possible to confirm the status of others on board right now. Many have not survived," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plane crashed at around 11:15 am local time, the military said in a statement, adding the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News portal Khabarhub reported the airplane had caught fire after skidding on the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's most trafficked air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, according to its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Belarus's top diplomat arrived in Pyongyang for a four-day visit, North Korean state media said Wednesday, as the two heavily sanctioned countries look to deepen ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "At the invitation of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK, Maxim Ruzenkov, foreign minister of the Republic of Belarus, arrived here on Tuesday to pay an official visit," the official Korean Central News Agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruzenkov's trip comes as the two states strengthened ties with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea will "deepen ties with Minsk on all fronts to open a new era of improved relationships," Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui said at a dinner welcoming the Belarusian delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruzenkov was reported as saying Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un both hoped to nurture a closer relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, the European Union agreed on new sanctions against Belarus over its role in the Ukraine war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, Russian leader Vladimir Putin made his first visit to North Korea in 24 years and signed a strategic treaty with leader Kim, including a commitment to come to each other's aid if attacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul and Washington have accused North Korea of supplying ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war, and the new treaty has fuelled fears of more deliveries. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from two landslides in southern Ethiopia has jumped to 229 and could rise further as the search for survivors and casualties continued into a second day, a government official said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following heavy rain, a landslide buried people in Gofa zone in Southern Ethiopia regional state on Sunday night, then a second one engulfed others who had gathered to help on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know when it will stop. We are still recovering bodies," Markos Melese, head of the National Disaster Response agency in Gofa Zone, told Reuters by phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still digging."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday an official said at least 50 people had died and children and police officers were among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage shared by the local administration showed people digging up bodies with shovels and bare hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The death toll surged after the people who came to rescue also got trapped," said Gofa district administrator Misikir Mitiku. "It is a very sad incident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he was deeply saddened by the terrible loss of life, and that federal officials had been deployed to reduce the impact of the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We stand in strong solidarity with the people and Government of Ethiopia as rescue efforts continue to find the missing and assist the displaced," African Union chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is Ethiopian, said he was thinking of all the families affected and that a WHO team had been sent to support immediate health needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the region continues to face the harsh impacts of climate change, we urge everyone to stay vigilant and follow safety protocols to protect lives and prevent further tragedies," said Workneh Gebeyehu, executive secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a regional bloc.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Trash from at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound on Wednesday, raising worries about the security of key South Korean facilities from North Korean provocations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the first time the South Korean leader's office in downtown Seoul, which is protected by scores of soldiers and a no-fly zone, had been directly hit by any of the thousands of trash-carrying balloons launched by Pyongyang since May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The chemical, biological and radiological (warfare) response team has safely collected the trash balloons," the presidential security service told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After investigation, results have confirmed that there were no danger or contamination of the object," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But experts said South Korea needs to shoot incoming North Korean balloons at border areas next time, as it was not clear whether North Korea would put in hazardous items in future campaigns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea's latest balloon launches came days after South Korea boosted its frontline broadcasts of K-pop songs and propaganda messages across the rivals’ heavily armed border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their tit-for-tat Cold War-style campaigns are inflaming tensions, with the rivals threatening stronger steps and warning of grave consequences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul officials earlier said North Korea had used the direction of winds to fly balloons toward South Korea, but some of the past balloons had timers that were likely meant to pop the bags of trash midair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The security service gave no further details about the rubbish found at the presidential compound, like whether balloons were discovered along with the trash. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over Trump, the Republican nominee.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In this campaign, I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week," she told a cheering crowd of several thousands at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a crucial battleground state in the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?" she asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris led Trump 44 percent to 42 percent among registered voters in the national Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Biden dropped out of the contest on Sunday and endorsed Harris as his successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous surveys taken before Biden's exit found Harris and Trump tied at 44 percent a week ago and Trump ahead of her by a percentage point at the beginning of the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In all three cases, the difference was within the poll's 3-point margin of error, but the results could signal some limited movement in Democrats' direction - and may suggest that Harris' elevation to the top of the ticket blunted whatever momentum Trump may have gained from last week's Republican National Convention, also in Milwaukee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris swiftly consolidated her party's support after Biden, 81, abandoned his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who worried about his ability to beat Trump or to serve for another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She wrapped up the nomination on Monday night by winning pledges from a majority of the delegates who at next month's party convention will determine the nominee, the campaign said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters were unhappy with their options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saddled with concerns that included his health and persistent high prices crimping Americans' household finances, Biden had been losing ground against Trump in opinion polls, particularly in the competitive states that are likely to decide the election, including Wisconsin and the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Nevada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Wisconsin event offered another opportunity for Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, to reset the Democrats' campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris has been raking in campaign contributions. Her campaign said on Monday she had raised US$100 million since Sunday, topping the US$95 million that the Biden campaign had in the bank at the end of June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, that are critical for Democrats' chances of defeating Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are independents and young people who did not like their choices, and Harris has a chance to win them," said Paul Kendrick, executive director of the Democratic group Rust Belt Rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, a Democrat, said Harris could also help bring back crucial Black voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of them didn't come along because they were distracted by his (Biden's) age, distracted by his appearance," he said. (Reuters)

    New world heat record set in July: Copernicus

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Climate change is causing more frequent extreme weather events, including heatwaves and prolonged droughts. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762877_1_20240724025615.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 July 21 was the hottest day ever registered globally, according to preliminary data published Tuesday by the EU's climate monitor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said the global average surface air temperature of 17.09 degrees Celsius (62.7 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday was the warmest in their record books, which go back to 1940.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as heatwaves and wildfires ravage swathes of Europe and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Earth has just experienced its warmest day," the monitor said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new daily high was 0.01 degree Celsius above the previous record temperature of 17.08 registered on July 6, 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On July 21st, C3S recorded a new record for the daily global mean temperature," C3S director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though just a tiny rise above the previous record, what was "truly staggering" was the streak of unprecedented global heat recorded over the past 13 months, Buontempo added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every month since June 2023 has eclipsed its own temperature record compared to the same month in previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copernicus said in this context, and at the peak of the northern hemisphere summer, it was not "completely unexpected" that this new daily high would be breached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be eclipsed by the soaring heat experienced earlier this week, the monitor said, pointing to a streak of record-breaking days that occurred in July and August 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global temperatures were expected to peak and drop soon though there could be further fluctuations in coming weeks, Copernicus said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate change is causing longer, stronger and more frequent extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods, and this year has been marked by major disasters across the globe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deadly heatwaves have already hit North America, Mexico, India and Thailand this year, to name a few, while flooding has devastated parts of East Africa, China and Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires are torching a path across southern and eastern Europe and in Canada and the United States as prolonged scorching temperatures in parts of the northern hemisphere make conditions tinder dry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming but emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases keep rising, despite international efforts to switch to clean energy and slow rising temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2023 was the hottest year on record and 2024 could follow in step considering the "sufficiently warm" temperatures experienced to date, Copernicus said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was "too early to predict with confidence" which would be hotter between the years, it added. (AFP)

    Secret Service head quits after shooting

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former US president and the Republican Party's presidential candidate, Donald Trump, sustained a two-centimetre wound on his right ear in the assassination attempt. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762875_1_20240724015556.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after acknowledging that the agency failed in its mission to prevent an assassination attempt against Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheatle was facing bipartisan calls to step down after a 20-year-old gunman wounded the former Republican president and current White House candidate at a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is overdue, she should have done this at least a week ago," Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters. "I'm happy to see that she has heeded the call of both Republicans and Democrats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden thanked Cheatle for her nearly three decades in the Secret Service and said she had "selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect our nation throughout her career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all know what happened that day can never happen again," Biden said in a statement. "As we move forward, I wish Kim all the best, and I will plan to appoint a new director soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle appeared before a congressional oversight committee on Monday and said the attack on Trump, who was slightly wounded in his right ear, represented a failure by the Secret Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called it "the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Republicans and Democrats called on Cheatle to resign during a tense hearing. She drew the ire of lawmakers from both parties by refusing to provide specific details about the attack, citing the existence of multiple active investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gunman opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after he began speaking at the campaign event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perched on the roof of a nearby building, he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper less than 30 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators have concluded the young man, who lived in a town about 50 miles (80 kilometres) from Butler, acted alone, and have not been able to identify any strong ideological or political leanings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two rally attendees were seriously wounded in the attack and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter, Corey Comperatore, was shot dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's former physician said over the weekend that the Republican candidate sustained a two-centimetre gunshot wound on his right ear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear," said ex-White House physician Ronny Jackson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle served as a Secret Service agent for 27 years before leaving in 2021 to become the head of security in North America for PepsiCo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was named to head the agency by President Joe Biden in 2022. (AFP)

    Philippine officials denounce 'fake video' of Marcos

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Philippine government officials have denounced as fake a video purporting to show the country's president, Ferdinand Marcos, inhaling a white powder. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762869_1_20240724001817.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A video allegedly showing Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos inhaling a white powder has been denounced as "fake" and "malicious", with investigators on Tuesday presenting close-up images of his ear to prove it was not him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The clip featuring a dark-haired man was part of a video shown at a rally in Los Angeles that was organised by a political group linked to Marcos's predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rally was livestreamed on the Facebook page of pro-Duterte broadcaster SMNI in the Philippines early Monday local time, hours before Marcos was due to deliver his annual State of the Nation address to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is obvious from the video that that is not our president. Their video is fake and obviously not real," Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro said Monday, after the video went viral on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teodoro said it was part of a "serious plan to destabilise our government".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video spread rapidly on Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. One Facebook post was viewed at least eight million times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duterte's former spokesman Harry Roque shared it on his Facebook page with a caption in Tagalog reading: "You be the judge".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was viewed 17,000 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police forensic experts held a news conference on Tuesday to prove the man in the video was not the president, presenting photos of Marcos and the unidentified man to compare their facial features.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enlarged images of their faces and right ears were placed side by side to demonstrate that Marcos's ear was larger in proportion to his face and had a different shape to those of the other man, whose ear curled over at the top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Be it AI (artificial intelligence) or imposter or whatever it was, as far as the (police) is concerned that is not the president," Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos said Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is a different person based on the ear. That's not even considering the jawline and the entire facial structure," Abalos said, describing the video as "malicious".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Marcos and Duterte families have had a bitter, public falling out as they attempt to shore up their rival support bases and secure key positions ahead of the 2025 mid-term elections. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Russia on Tuesday pushed back against a US warning over their military and economic cooperation in the Arctic, where climate change is opening up greater competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing said it acts on the "principles of respect, cooperation, mutual wins and sustainability", adding it's committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States distorts China's Arctic policy and makes thoughtless remarks on China's normal Arctic activities (which are) in accordance with international law," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia "does its part to ensure that the Arctic does not become a territory of discord and tension."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that Russia's cooperation with China "contributes to an atmosphere of stability and predictability" in the Arctic, and their actions were not targeted against other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks said, "We've seen growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia in the Arctic commercially, with the PRC being a major funder of Russian energy exploitation in the Arctic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also growing military cooperation, "with Russia and China conducting joint exercises off the coast of Alaska," Hicks said as the department released its 2024 Arctic strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington's Arctic strategy describes the area as "a strategically important region" for the US that includes "the northern approaches to the homeland" and "significant US defence infrastructure." (Reporting by AFP)

    Hamas, Fatah sign landmark declaration in Beijing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi, centre, and members of various Palestinian factions attend the signing of the Beijing Declaration aimed at ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762795_1_20240723145747.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Tuesday announced it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an "interim national reconciliation government" to govern post-war Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it," Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian factions met with the media, with Wang present, CGTN said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among the factions held in Beijing from July 21-23, CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's attack on southern Israel last October, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to "reconciliation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza," he said following the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the factions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today."
