  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said that Hong Kong's deepening cooperation with the Middle East can go beyond finance, innovation and technology, and investment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing in his blog, Chan said the SAR can also promote more people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual learning between China and the Middle East.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "During meetings and exchanges, many Middle Eastern investment institutions said that Hong Kong is international, diverse, and can respect different cultural values, allowing both parties to deepen cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit," he wrote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To them, Hong Kong's role as a 'super connector' not only connects the mainland with European, American and Middle Eastern markets, but can also be extended to connecting emerging markets with different backgrounds and cultures."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also said his visit to Riyadh the past week was fruitful and that a series of projects were being facilitated as a result, proving that “Brand Hong Kong” not only has unique value, but also great development potential.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also said he is in talks with the Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative to host its second summit in the SAR next year.

   Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Sunday said she hopes to promote the SAR as a talent hub at the upcoming National People’s Congress Standing Committee meeting in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the top legislative body will at the meeting review several bills and reports, including on developing world-class universities on the mainland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She expressed the hope that these institutions will boost cooperation with universities in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I want to hear about what policies there will be in terms of the cooperation between the mainland’s ‘double first-class universities’ and Hong Kong’s universities. These are important for building Hong Kong into an international hub for top talents,” Lee told reporters at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five-day NPC session will be held from Monday to Friday.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Disneyland on Sunday wrapped up its weekend marathon event, which was attended by a record-breaking number of runners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly 20,000 people – including children and those with visual, hearing and physical disabilities – signed up for the event, a record for the Hong Kong Disneyland 10K Weekend 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan, one of the guests of honour, said it was the first time runners could jog through World of Frozen, the world’s first and largest attraction themed on the popular Disney franchise. Chan said this shows that the SAR is full of attractions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This event shows that as long as we use our brains to think of new ideas we can draw more people to Hong Kong because there are so many attractive places here,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There are so many people from the mainland other places in the world. We welcome you.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One runner, dressed as Queen Anna from Frozen, travelled with her family from Thailand. She said she visits the SAR a lot and loves the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong, first of all, is close and another thing is like we enjoy local food very much. We like to taste food and all the culture and this trip I plan to take them on the tram to see all the scenery of Hong Kong," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I love it very much. The mountain, the ocean and the city is all so good."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another participant, who is visually impaired, said he completed his first 10-kilometre race in about 70 minutes and that racing through the theme park was a whole new experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The race in Disneyland is so different from other races. They play music in these races, while most races don't," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think music is a form of motivation, and Disney music sounds really good. When they play it while you are running, it is like an adrenaline rush."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police have arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and robbery, after an off-duty sergeant was attacked and had his wallet snatched in Jordan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident happened in the small hours of Saturday on Nathan Road near Wing On Plus department store.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Senior Inspector So Man-ho said the victim got into a scuffle with the suspect after realising his wallet had been stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The victim identified himself as a police officer, but the man attacked his neck and limbs multiple times with a sharp object. The victim tried several times to stop the assault but failed," So said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Another passerby attempted to intervene, and filmed the incident with his phone. The attacker fled empty-handed,” he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sergeant was treated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and was discharged on the same day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers on Saturday arrested the attacker, who is a foreign man on a temporary entry permit, at his home in Hung Hom.

   Hong Kong's swimming queen Siobhan Haughey has capped off her medal-studded World Aquatics Swimming World Cup 2024 performance by winning silver in the 100-metre freestyle event in Singapore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haughey on Saturday finished the 100-metre race in 51.56 seconds, just under a second behind American Kate Douglass' 50.82-second performance. Poland's Katarzyna Wasick rounded off the podium with a time of 52.04 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SAR Olympic medallist finished the event – which was held in Shanghai, Incheon and Singapore – with five gold, and two silver and bronze medals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday in Singapore, she was crowned the 200-metre freestyle queen after a clean sweep in the event. On the same day, she appeared poolside in an inflatable panda costume and waved to cheering crowds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When you have to work on your birthday, but luckily, it's Halloween", she said on her Instagram.

  <img alt="Officials say drug-related crime in Poitiers has soared. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777343_1_20241102215300.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 15-year-old boy shot in the head during a bloody shootout between drug gangs in the west of France on Saturday died of his wounds, the regional prosecutor announced, as the interior minister warned the country was at risk of "Mexicanisation" due to rising drug crime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The teen had been in intensive care since the shootings Thursday evening in the city of Poitiers, which have raised alarm nationwide over increasing violence in gangland turf wars that are making the streets unsafe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other minors, aged between 15 and 16, were also injured by gunshots fired in front of a restaurant in the city in the incident which involved dozens of people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers used tear gas to break up the fight, restoring order around 45 minutes after arriving on the scene, the source added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Friday that France's struggle with drug-related violence is at a "tipping point," with the nation facing a choice between "full mobilisation or the 'Mexicanisation' of the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mexico has suffered more than 450,000 drug-related killings since the government started using the military to fight its notorious drug cartels in 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gangland violence long associated with the Mediterranean port city Marseille has expanded into other French cities in recent years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victims can include gang members, some of them minors guarding dealing spots or employed as hitmen, but also innocent bystanders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Poitiers' experience on Thursday was "unprecedented" for the city of 90,000, mayor Leonore Moncond'huy said, adding that it "demonstrated rather serious developments in society."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Retailleau, a member of the right-wing Republicans and seen as a hardliner on security issues, has called for the battle against drug violence to become a "nationwide effort" since becoming interior minister in Prime Minister Michel Barnier's shaky minority government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The 'narco thugs' have no limits any more... These shootouts aren't happening in South America, they're happening in Rennes, in Poitiers... we're at a tipping point," Retailleau told BFMTV. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City suffered their first Premier League loss since December as Bournemouth stunned the champions, while Arsenal were rocked by Newcastle and Liverpool seized top spot on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City were unbeaten in their previous 32 league games, dating back to a defeat at Aston Villa last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Pep Guardiola's second-placed side saw that streak come to an unexpected end in a 2-1 loss on England's south coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Cherries had never beaten City in their 21 previous meetings, losing 19 of those matches, yet Andoni Iraola's team sprang a huge upset to derail the champions' push for a fifth successive title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bournemouth recently damaged Arsenal's title hopes with a 2-0 win at the Vitality Stadium and they inflicted pain on City as well.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Guardiola had claimed City faced an injury "emergency" after they suffered fitness problems in Wednesday's League Cup defeat at Tottenham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Exhausted or not, City were rocked in the ninth minute when Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo drilled Milos Kerkez's cross past Ederson from inside the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Guardiola's men were unable to muster a response to that blow and Evanilson doubled Bournemouth's lead in the 64th minute with a composed finish from Kerkez's cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Josko Gvardiol's header reduced the deficit in the 82nd minute, but it was too late to save City from a second defeat in four days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have a lot of players with no minutes so the balance is a bit uncomfortable. Today we could not handle their intensity. That's why we lost the game," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Newcastle put a huge dent in fourth-placed Arsenal's title aspirations with a 1-0 win at St James' Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alexander Isak netted in the 12th minute, heading home Anthony Gordon's pinpoint cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Injury-hit Arsenal struggled to get out of first gear and produced just one shot on target in the entire game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mikel Arteta's team, runners-up to City for the past two years, have taken just one point from their last three games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Today we weren't our best version. It's about how you react to that. We're not going to find the right words or answers to describe how we feel," said Arteta, whose side are seven points adrift of first place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At Anfield, Liverpool were in danger of a surprise loss of their own before regrouping to take advantage of their rivals' stumbles with a 2-1 win over Brighton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ferdi Kadioglu gave Brighton the lead in the 14th minute with a fierce strike that cannoned in off the post after Danny Welbeck flicked on Kaoru Mitoma's cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Liverpool had beaten Brighton in the League Cup last 16 in midweek and they repeated the trick thanks to a late revival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cody Gakpo bagged the equaliser in the 69th minute with a cross that looped straight into the net.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three minutes later, Mohamed Salah put Liverpool ahead, the Egypt forward curling a fine finish into the top corner for his ninth goal this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Arne Slot's first season in charge, Liverpool are two points clear of City after their eighth win in 10 league games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "More than the position we are in, if you face a team like this and are 1-0 down and can come back to a 2-1 win that gives me a lot of confidence," Slot said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nottingham Forest are up to third place after beating 10-man West Ham 3-0 to make it three consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since 1999.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chris Wood grabbed his eighth goal in 10 league games in the 27th minute and West Ham had Edson Alvarez sent off in first-half stoppage-time.

   <br/>
   Callum Hudson-Odoi struck in the 65th minute and Ola Aina sealed the points 12 minutes from full-time at the City Ground.

   Jordan Ayew's stoppage-time equaliser denied third-bottom Ipswich their first top-flight win since 2002 as Leicester rescued a 1-1 draw at Portman Road.

   Leif Davis' 55th-minute volley put Ipswich ahead but the hosts had Kalvin Phillips sent off in the 77th minute.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Air pollution in Pakistan's second biggest city Lahore soared on Saturday, around 40 times over the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation (WHO), data from IQAir showed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The level of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – peaked at 610, with a reading above 15 in a 24-hour period considered unhealthy by the WHO.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The air quality index, which measures a range of pollutants, also spiked at 1,067.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have never reached a level of 1,000," said Jahangir Anwar, a senior environmental protection official in Lahore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For days, Lahore has been enveloped by smog, a mix of fog and pollutants caused by low-grade diesel fumes, smoke from seasonal agricultural burning and winter cooling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Wednesday, the provincial environmental protection agency announced new restrictions in four "hot spots" in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuk-tuks equipped with polluting two-stroke engines are banned, as are restaurants that barbecue without filters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government offices and private companies will have half their staff work from home starting on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Construction work has been halted and street and food vendors, who often cook over open fires, must close at 8 pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Smog is particularly pronounced in winter when cold, denser air traps emissions from poor-quality fuels used to power the city's vehicles and factories at ground level. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 5.48-metre Australian crocodile that held the world record as the largest crocodile in captivity has died, a wildlife sanctuary said on Saturday. He was thought to be more than 110 years old.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cassius, weighing in at more than one ton, had been in declining health since October 15, Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat said on Facebook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild Croc," according to a post by the organisation, based on Green Island near the Queensland tourist town of Cairns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Cassius will be deeply missed, but our love and memories of him will remain in our hearts forever."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group's website said he had lived at the sanctuary since 1987 after being transported from the neighbouring Northern Territory, where crocodiles are a key part of the region's tourist industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cassius, a saltwater crocodile, held the Guinness World Records title as the world's largest crocodile in captivity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He took the title after the 2013 death of Philippines crocodile Lolong, who measured 6.17 metres long, according to Guinness. (Reuters)

    Badenoch elected new leader of UK Conservative Party

  <img alt="Kemi Badenoch has called for a return to conservative values. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777338_1_20241102194657.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   "Anti-woke" candidate Kemi Badenoch on Saturday won the vote to become the UK Conservatives' new leader, replacing Rishi Sunak who quit after the party's disastrous showing in July's general election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Badenoch, 44, came out on top in the two-horse race with former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, winning 57 percent of the votes of party members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said that becoming party leader was an "enormous honour," but that "the task that stands before us is tough."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be honest about the fact we made mistakes" and "let standards slip," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is time to get down to business, it is time to renew," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The combative former equalities minister now faces the daunting task of reuniting a divided and weakened party that was emphatically ousted from power in July after 14 years in charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Badenoch will become the official leader of the opposition and face off against Labour's Keir Starmer in the House of Commons every Wednesday for the traditional Prime Minister's Questions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, she will be leading a much-reduced cohort of Tory MPs in the chamber following the party's dismal election showing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She must plot a strategy to regain public trust while stemming the flow of support to the right-wing Reform UK party, led by Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Having campaigned on a right-wing platform, she also faces the prospect of future difficulties within the ranks of Tory lawmakers, which includes many centrists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Badenoch, born in London to Nigerian parents and raised in Lagos, has called for a return to conservative values, accusing her party of having become increasingly liberal on societal issues such as gender identity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She describes herself as a straight-talker, a trait that has caused controversy on the campaign trail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When addressing immigration, Badenoch said that "not all cultures are equally valid" when deciding who should be allowed to live in the UK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was widely criticised after suggesting that statutory maternity pay on small businesses was "excessive" and sparked further furore when she joked that up to 10 percent of Britain's half a million civil servants were so bad that they "should be in prison." (AFP)

  <img alt="Spaniard Jorge Martin and his team celebrate after he won Saturday's sprint race in Malaysia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777334_1_20241102191043.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Jorge Martin took a major step towards his first MotoGP world title as he won the sprint race in Malaysia on Saturday and rival Francesco Bagnaia crashed out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain's Martin extended his championship lead to 29 points from 17, with just the grand prix on Sunday at Sepang and one more race weekend to go.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a bitter blow for Italian two-time reigning champion Bagnaia, who started on pole but came off his Ducati early on to gift a big advantage to Martin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pramac Ducati's Martin romped home nearly a second ahead of six-time world champion Marc Marquez and can seal the title on Sunday if he earns nine more points than Bagnaia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think last year I wasn't ready to win," said the 26-year-old Martin, who came second in the title race behind his rival last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This season I am more mature. It is a privilege to be here at this point with this advantage, but nothing is over till it's over."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Light rain fell at a sweltering Sepang five minutes before the start of the 10-lap sprint, adding to the tension on the grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia started on pole with Martin alongside him on the front row, only for the Spaniard to seize the lead at the first corner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With eight laps to go and pushing hard, Bagnaia lost control of his Ducati at turn nine and slid out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was unhurt but had his head in his hands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I entered the corner a bit slower but I touched the back on the apex of the corner and I lost the front," said the 27-year-old.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's something that can happen, but all the risk I was taking to fight back with Jorge wasn't over the limit."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia dominated Friday's practice and clocked a track record to grab pole for the sprint and the grand prix on Sunday, when 25 points are up for grabs for the winner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think Pecco will risk a lot tomorrow to win," Martin said of the Italian.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So to beat him in these conditions is really tough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He has nothing to lose now. It's all or nothing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The season finale had been scheduled for Valencia in a fortnight but it was cancelled on Friday after deadly flooding in that part of Spain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers are rushing to find a replacement venue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A minute's silence was held in Sepang before the sprint race to remember the more than 200 dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Right now all my prayers are for Valencia and people at home," said Martin. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain will deploy 10,000 more troops and police officers to the eastern Valencia region devastated by historic floods that have killed 211 people, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hopes of finding survivors more than three days after torrents of muddy water submerged towns and wrecked infrastructure were slim in the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Almost all the deaths have been recorded in the eastern Valencia region, where thousands of security and emergency services personnel were frantically clearing debris and mud in the search for bodies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sanchez said in a televised address that the disaster was the second deadliest flood in Europe this century and announced a huge increase in the security forces for relief works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government had accepted the Valencia region leader's request for 5,000 more troops and informed him of a further deployment of 5,000 police officers and civil guards, Sanchez said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain was carrying out its largest deployment of army and security force personnel in peacetime, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Restoring order and distributing aid to destroyed towns and villages – some of which have been cut off from food, water and power for days – is a priority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have come under fire over the adequacy of warning systems before the floods, and some stricken residents have complained the response to the disaster is too slow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am aware the response is not enough, there are problems and severe shortages... towns buried by mud, desperate people searching for their relatives," Sanchez said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Susana Camarero, deputy head of the Valencia region, told journalists on Saturday that essential supplies had been delivered "from day one" to all accessible settlements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it was "logical" that affected residents were asking for more, she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities in the Valencia region have restricted access to roads for two days to allow emergency services to carry out search, rescue and logistics operations more effectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials have said dozens of people remain unaccounted for.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But with telephone and transport networks severely damaged, establishing a precise figure is difficult.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Friday told Cadena Ser radio station that it was "reasonable" to believe more fatalities would emerge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is also hoped that the estimated number of missing people will fall once telephone and internet services are running again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thousands of ordinary citizens pushing shopping trolleys and carrying cleaning equipment took to the streets on Friday to help with the clean-up effort.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Camarero said some municipalities were "overwhelmed by the amount of solidarity and food" they had received.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The surge in togetherness continued on Saturday as around 1,000 people set off from the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia towards nearby towns laid waste by the floods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have urged them to stay at home to avoid congestion on the roads that would hamper the work of emergency services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The storm that sparked the floods on Tuesday formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for this time of year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But scientists warn that climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police have arrested eight men reportedly with a triad background, after a prison officer was attacked outside Pik Uk prison in Sai Kung yesterday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three masked men equipped with "long hard objects" attacked the corrections officer when he was waiting for a bus near the prison at about 12:50pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trio, aged 16 to 37, then got in a private car with a fake license plate and fled the scene.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Superintendent Lam Kai-chor said while they are still investigating a motive for the attack, whether it's related to the victim's job, no evidence shows correlation to the victim's financial situation or personal life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are a total of six cuts that are five to 10 centimetres long on the victim's head and upper limbs, and a fracture on his right wrist. The victim is now stable and remains in hospital for treatment," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Also, during the chaos, the three men hit a 33-year-old woman and her two-year-old daughter. They sustained minor injuries and left the hospital after treatment without any issues."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Macau's Chief Executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has vowed to diversify the SAR's economy, a day after receiving his formal appointment letter from Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said on Saturday that he was deeply honoured for his official appointment as the chief executive for the sixth term of the Macau government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Xi Jinping met Sam, a former Macau top judge, in Beijing on Friday, with the Chinese leader saying the central government fully endorses and trusts the incoming chief executive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters upon returning, Sam pledged to accurately and comprehensively implement One Country, Two Systems, safeguard national security, and support growth of its economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Economic diversification is an issue of great concern to President Xi and central authorities. We must continue to create conditions on this front in the future, and steadily promote economic diversification," Sam said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the new government set to be sworn in on December 20, Sam said he aimed to hand in a list of the proposed governing team to Beijing within a month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He won 394 votes from a 400-strong election committee in the CE election on October 13.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed on Saturday to respond to attacks by Israel and its ally the United States against Tehran and groups it supports in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation, and the resistance front," said Khamenei at a student gathering in Tehran, referring to the alliance of Tehran-backed groups that include Yemen's Houthis, Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes as Washington announced the deployment of additional military assets to the Middle East, including ballistic missile defense destroyers and long-range B-52 bomber aircraft, serving as a warning to Iran as it and Israel trade tit-for-tat strikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had launched rockets at an Israeli intelligence base near Tel Aviv in the early hours of Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah and Israel exchanged cross-border fire for nearly a year after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war, before Israel ramped up the conflict on September 23.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group frequently claims to have fired rockets at Israeli bases or urban areas in Israeli territory, and has several times claimed the targeting of Glilot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military said on Saturday that sirens were activated following the arrival of "suspicious aerial targets" from Lebanon and the targets remained under surveillance in an ongoing incident. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nearly 200,000 people in western Japan were urged to evacuate on Saturday as authorities warned of landslides and floods while the remnants of a tropical storm trickle over the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Japan Meteorological Agency said "warm, moist air... was causing heavy rainfall with thunderstorms in western Japan" partly due to Kong-rey, which was downgraded to an extratropical low-pressure system from a typhoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The city of Matsuyama "issued the top-level warning, urging 189,552 residents in its 10 districts to evacuate and immediately secure safety," a city official told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the evacuation was not mandatory, Japan's highest-level warning is typically issued when it is extremely likely that some kind of disaster has already occurred.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters warned that landslides and floods could affect western Japan on Saturday and eastern Japan on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Due to rain, shinkansen bullet trains were briefly suspended between Tokyo and southern Fukuoka region in the morning before resuming on a delayed schedule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kong-rey smashed into Taiwan on Thursday as one of the biggest storms to hit the island in decades. It claimed at least two lives and knocked out power to tens of thousands of households.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say human-driven climate change is intensifying the risk posed by heavy rains because a warmer atmosphere holds more water. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A country park near the border with Shenzhen is key to ecological conservation and revitalisation, according to the Environment minister Tse Chin-wan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Located in Sha Tau Kok, the 530-hectare Robin's Nest Country Park was once a prime mining site.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The area, which was established this year as the 25th country park in Hong Kong, also supports one of the most important bat colonies in the territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is gradually constructing recreational facilities, such as hiking trail networks and viewing points in Robin's Nest Country Park," Tse said at the park's opening ceremony on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It also expects to complete the revitalisation of the Lin Ma Hang Lead Mine by the end of the year and open it to the public, allowing people to deepen their understanding of Hong Kong's mining history, and bat ecology there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robin's Nest is connected to Shenzhen Wutong Mountain, forming a cross-border ecological corridor between the SAR and neighbouring Shenzhen. The park is rich in biodiversity with many species of high conservation value.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The immigration chief has revealed that he personally reached out to snooker superstar Ronnie O'Sullivan, recommending a suitable visa scheme for the Briton to come to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old, known as "the Rocket" for his fast and attacking playing style, recently became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, saying the territory is a great place to live because of the food, culture and a low tax regime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a televised interview on Saturday, Director of Immigration Benson Kwok revealed he found out from a friend that O'Sullivan had interest to develop his career in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As the director of the Immigration, of course, I have to recommend some visa schemes that are suitable for him. He quickly chose the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, and his application was approved by the committee on quality migrants and professionals," Kwok said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The result was ideal because O'Sullivan has been helpful, promoting Hong Kong's attractiveness."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun, for his part, said the snooker player's decision to obtain Hong Kong residency was a testament to the city's attractiveness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The fact that O'Sullivan has decided to come to Hong Kong and become a part of us speaks volumes about the attraction of the SAR," Sun said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope to achieve more success, because we truly believe in the attraction of Hong Kong. Be it our tax system, our natural beauty, the convenience, the great food and all the great things here in Hong Kong, it's a huge attraction for top talent all over the world."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A lawmaker has highlighted the need for Hong Kong to have more large-scale, staple infrastructure in order to deepen and broaden its tourist base.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Michael Tien made the remarks on Saturday on a Commercial Radio Programme, where he pointed out that even though tourism has only contributed less than 10 percent to the local GDP, it's crucial to other sectors, like retail and the food and beverage industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tien emphasised that, rather than relying on mainland visitors, the territory can set up more permanent attractions like Disneyland and Kai Tak to draw more visitors from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kai Tak - the largest sports park in Hong Kong with 50,000 seats - is set to open its doors next March, and will host British rock band Coldplay a month later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Kai Tak so far, and Disneyland are about the only two continuous attractions we have to attract people from overseas to come to Hong Kong to spend, to consume, and we need a few more of this," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've been advocating for a race track with reclamation at Penny's Bay. That could be a third long-term tourist infrastructure...the beauty about Disneyland and Kai Tak is that they're perpetual - they can generate new economic activity, day after day."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Tien, who's also a businessman, called on the government to offer two years of rates concessions to ease the burden on tenants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said many are paying "astronomical rents" for agreements that were signed at a time when tourist traffic was much higher.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are now currently paying rental to support actually a much larger consumer base, dating back to 2017 and 2018, when a lot of mainlanders were coming down to Hong Kong to spend money, so we lost about 30 percent on that consumer base," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Therefore, based on a free market economy, the rents are going to come down. So we need breathing space of about two years to have new tenancy to be in effect. So this is the two-year relief that I am asking the government to help us on."

    Talent scheme screening system 'robust': labour chief

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun has assured there is a strict system to screen people applying to enter Hong Kong under the top talent scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said on Saturday that officials have not found anyone providing fake credentials, following earlier reports of people allegedly forging documents to cheat their way into a local university.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have built in a very, very robust system to make sure that all the qualifications submitted to us are true, and can be verified," Sun told reporters after a radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For submissions, say, from mainland China, it's a mandatory requirement. They have to verify via a third-party system, or they have to verify directly with the institution granting them the qualifications."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The administration had said visa holders under the scheme will be given an extra two months to apply for an extension.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Extension approvals will be granted based on various factors, including the person's income, tax payments and time spent in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The labour minister pointed out that officials do not currently have an estimate on how many individuals would have their visas extended.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The NBA champion Boston Celtics, fueled by 32 points from Jayson Tatum, bounced back from an overtime defeat with a gritty 124-109 victory over the Hornets in Charlotte on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum added 11 points for his third double-double of the season and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points with six rebounds and five assists in a physical game that saw tensions erupt in the fourth quarter when former Celtic Grant Williams sent Tatum sprawling with a shoulder-to-shoulder check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Williams was ejected, but Brown and others were clearly angered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Less than a minute later, LaMelo ball was assessed a flagrant foul for crowding in under Tatum as the Celtics star attempted a three-pointer, and Charlotte's Miles Bridges was ejected in the final minutes for punching the ball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It all could make for fireworks when the teams face off again on Saturday, but Charlotte's loss of composure was costly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Toronto, the Los Angeles Lakers let a 26-point lead dwindle to single digits but held on to snap a two-game losing streak with a 131-125 victory over the Raptors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James set the tone early, scoring 14 of his 27 points in the first quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anthony Davis poured in 38 points and pulled down 12 rebounds in another monster offensive effort. However, he was more concerned that the Lakers, up 76-51 at halftime, let the Raptors back into the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Toronto had cut the deficit to six points early in the fourth quarter and the Lakers' lead was at eight, 106-98, when Rui Hachimura drilled a pair of three-pointers to push Los Angeles' advantage back to 12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That lead was halved with 1:02 remaining before the Lakers closed it out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Unacceptable," Davis said. "We won, and we'll take the win for sure because it's hard to win in this league, especially on the road. (AFP)

    Nvidia to join key US stock index

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chip giant Nvidia will join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Wall Street index announced on Friday, underscoring the importance of artificial intelligence in the US economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The addition of Nvidia, which will take effect on November 8, also marks a historic moment for the semiconductor industry, as the AI chip leader replaces struggling rival Intel, which has been a Dow constituent since 1999.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   S&P Dow Jones Indices, the company that runs the index, also said it would add paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams, replacing chemical giant Dow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180 percent this year as tech giants clamour for its powerful and high cost processors that power generative AI, the technology that is widely seen as the next phase of innovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Intel, one of Silicon Valley's most iconic companies, has seen its shares fall 50 percent so far this year as the company struggles to meet the AI boom.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow in 1896, is often used as a bellwether for the state of the US stock market, the biggest in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unlike the S&P500 that weighs companies by market capitalization, the 30-stock Dow is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more influence on its movements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tech companies Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce and Cisco Systems are currently in the index, while Google, Amazon and Meta are not. (AFP)

  <img alt="US markets closed higher on growing hopes of an interest rate cut next month. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777288_1_20241102084932.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks rebounded on Friday from mixed tech earnings and investor jitters less than a week before a neck-and-neck US presidential election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After major indices tumbled on Thursday following big drops in Microsoft and Meta, buoyant results from Amazon helped boost the market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors also took the bright side of a weak employment report that showed the US economy added just 12,000 jobs last month, far below expectations in a report that was temporarily distorted by major hurricanes and the Boeing strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But on the positive side, the report bolstered the chance that the Fed will reduce interest rates again next week. Futures markets overwhelmingly expect a quarter-point cut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All three major US indices advanced, led by the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.7 percent at 42,052.19, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 5,728.80 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 percent to 18,239.92.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Amazon report "countered some of the negativity that was building yesterday on the mega-cap" stocks, said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts expect cautious trading early next week ahead of the US presidential election on Tuesday, with the result possibly delayed for several days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oil prices gained following reports that Iran was planning a major retaliatory strike on Israel, reviving the market's geopolitical fears.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expectations of a major rate cut by the Fed, like the bumper 50 basis point cut in September, have receded after data showed strong economic growth in the United States and inflation just above the central bank's long-term two percent target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the "lower-than-expected jobs creation could prompt the Fed to follow through with the widely anticipated 25 basis point cut following their next meeting later next week," said Mahmoud Alkudsi, senior market analyst at ADSS brokerage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst with eToro, said the October jobs numbers "should keep a December rate cut on the table, too." (AFP)

    Spotlight on half-backs as Springboks eye tour sweep

  <img alt="South Africa's squad includes 26 of the 35 World Cup winners from last year. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777244_1_20241101193342.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Who starts at fly-half and scrum-half will command most attention when world champions South Africa launch a three-Test tour of Britain on November 10 against Scotland in Edinburgh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Creative Manie Libbok and ace goal-kicker Handre Pollard are the rivals for the playmaker role while Jaden Hendrikse, Cobus Reinach and Grant Williams eye the number 9 shirt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Young fly-half Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, the find of the season for the Springboks, misses out as he recovers from a knee operation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Calm under intense pressure, Pollard has started four of 10 Tests this year and boasts a near 80 percent goal-kicking record.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Libbok was a starter just twice, and an erratic goal kicker with a 58 percent success rate. He has been hailed, however, for his handling, running and ability to create scoring chances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two-time World Cup-winning scrum-half Faf de Klerk was available after a lengthy absence due to a thigh injury, but did not make the squad, possibly because he last played in mid July.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Africa, who beat Italy and England and lost to France and Ireland on their last end-of-season tour two years ago, are seeking a first sweep since 2013.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If head coach Rassie Erasmus opts to kick off the tour – which also includes internationals against England and Wales – with his strongest side most of the other 13 selections appear clearcut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Damian Willemse ruled out by a groin injury, Aphelele Fassi should continue at full-back after a superb return to form this year following two seasons in the Test wilderness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wings Cheslin Kolbe and Kurt-Lee Arendse and centres Jesse Kriel and Damian de Allende have been first choices throughout a season in which South Africa have won eight of 10 Tests.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Erasmus has three hookers to choose from with Bongi Mbonambi and often outstanding impact player Malcolm Marx favoured to make the matchday 23.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Loosehead Ox Nche and tighthead Vincent Koch – in the absence of injured Frans Malherbe – are the likely props.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is stiff competition to join Eben Etzebeth in the second row. Leinster lock RG Snyman is used to British conditions and this may give him the edge over Franco Mostert and Ruan Nortje.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pieter-Steph du Toit, considered by many Springbok supporters as the best rugby player in the world this year, and captain Siya Kolisi are the first-choice flankers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Loose forward Duane Vermeulen retired after South Africa edged arch rivals New Zealand 12-11 in Paris last October to win back-to-back World Cup finals, and a record fourth title overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That opened the door for Jasper Wiese to inherit the number 8 shirt, although Cameron Hanekom, who can operate in all three back-row positions, is a rising star and potential challenger.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hanekom, fly-half Jordan Hendrikse, hooker Johan Grobbelaar and tighthead Wilco Louw were late additions in place of injured trio Willemse, prop-hooker Jan-Hendrik Wessels and Malherbe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The squad includes 26 of the 35 World Cup winners from last year and 10 of the starting line-up against the All Blacks in the title decider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is a healthy mix of youth and experience with most of the players having made strong statements in the Springbok jersey this season," says Erasmus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Having played key coaching roles in the 2019 and 2023 World Cup triumphs, Erasmus faces fresh challenges ahead of the next global showpiece, which Australia will host in 2027.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the triumphant squad of last year will be closer to 40 than 30 by the next World Cup, and Erasmus admits age is a factor as he plots the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot look too far ahead and forget the present. But we also cannot get stuck in the present. There are guys in the squad who were not there before the last World Cup," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Erasmus says his aim before 2027 is to develop a squad in which "ideally there are three excellent players competing for every position." (AFP)

    'Brat' named word of the year by Collins dictionary

  <img alt="Thanks to singer Charli XCX the word 'brat' now means a lot more than simply a badly-behaved child. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777242_1_20241101192506.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Brat, the word redefined by singer Charli XCX and adopted by supporters of US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, was on Friday named the Collins Word of the Year 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Brat" was the name of the UK singer's hit sixth album, and the word has now come to represent a "confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude," said Collins, rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Inspired by the Charli XCX album, 'brat' has become one of the most talked about words of 2024," said the UK-based dictionary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "More than a hugely successful album, 'brat' is a cultural phenomenon that has resonated with people globally, and 'brat summer' established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 32-year-old pop star, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, described the typical brat girl as someone "who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes, who feels herself, but then also maybe has a breakdown, but kind of parties through it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She tweeted in July that "Kamala IS brat," in reference to the US Vice President, prompting the presidential nominee to use her song "365" in one of her TikTok videos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Her campaign account also re-branded with a lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The album hit number one in her native UK and number three in the US. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Friday met Macau's Chief Executive-elect Sam Hou-fai at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi said Sam's high number of nominations and votes in the recent CE election showed he received widespread support from Macau society.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president added the central government fully endorses and trusts him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi added that Beijing will continue to firmly implement the principles of One Country, Two Systems; Macau people governing Macau; and a high degree of autonomy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sam said he was deeply honoured and keenly aware of the responsibility, pledging to fully implement One Country, Two Systems and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Witnessed by Xi, Sam was presented with an instrument of appointment as the sixth-term CE of Macau by Premier Li Qiang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He will be sworn in on December 20.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former Macau top judge won 394 votes from a 400-strong election committee in the CE election on October 13.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rescuers on Friday raised the death toll in Spain's worst floods for a generation to at least 205 as the government deployed more troops in an increasingly desperate search for survivors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The floods that have tossed vehicles, collapsed bridges and covered towns with mud since Tuesday are the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organisation coordinating emergency services in the hardest-hit eastern Valencia region said 202 people had been confirmed dead there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials in neighbouring Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia had already announced a combined three deaths in their regions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rescuers equipped with drones and sniffer dogs waded through the water and rummaged through debris in search of the dozens of people the authorities believe are still missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is deploying an extra 500 troops to the stricken areas to bolster the 1,200 already on site for search, rescue and logistics tasks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some cut-off areas remain without water, food or power three days after the floods began, and many roads and rail lines remain inaccessible, raising fears the death toll will climb.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is still a pile of cars in the industrial estate, mountains and mountains of cars," Amparo Fort, mayor of the town of Chiva, told public radio RNE.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many must be empty, but we are sure others are occupied," Fort said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to national weather service AEMET, the town west of Valencia city recorded 491 mm of rain in just eight hours on Tuesday – almost equalling a year's worth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government minister Angel Victor Torres on Thursday vowed an uncompromising response to looting, in a sign order was breaking down in some places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police on Friday said they had arrested 50 people for incidents including theft from cars and a jewellery store.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the Valencia region town of Aldaia, Fernando Lozano said he saw thieves grabbing items from an abandoned supermarket as "people are a bit desperate".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Until things return to normal and the supermarket opens, it's going to be very bad here."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slabs of tarmac from destroyed roads littered fields inundated with murky brown water and mud caked the ground floor of homes in the Valencia region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The courthouse in Valencia city has been converted into a morgue, where health workers wearing smocks carried stretchers covered with white sheets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An army of hundreds of volunteers set off from Valencia on Friday armed with shovels, buckets and shopping trolleys laden with food and nappies to help distressed neighbours in the city's flooded suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hailed "the limitless solidarity and dedication of Spanish society" on X and pledged aid "for as long as it takes."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Valencia regional government urged people not to travel to the worst-affected areas, saying emergency services could not reach them and that roads risked collapsing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hundreds of people spent a third night without power or communications and slept in temporary shelters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   AEMET placed part of the southern Andalusia region on the highest alert level for torrential rain on Friday and maintained warnings for Valencia, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The storm that sparked the floods formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for the time of year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But scientists say climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Valencia will not host the final MotoGP of the season organisers announced on Friday, owing to the devastating flooding in the east of Spain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The race was due to be held on November 17 and a new venue will be "confirmed as soon as possible" said organisers in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the top MotoGP riders had called for the race to be moved away from Valencia after the devastating floods which have killed at least 205 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Floods devastated towns, piling up cars collapsing bridges and filling streets with mud in Spain's biggest such disaster for decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have been in constant contact with the local authorities and the circuit to best assess how we can help and how we should proceed," said MotoGP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After carefully weighing up the potential positive impact of MotoGP racing in Valencia on delayed dates versus ensuring no single resource is diverted from the recovery efforts by the presence of MotoGP, the championship and local authorities have been obliged to cancel the 2024 Valencia GP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In lieu of racing in Valencia, MotoGP will instead race for Valencia... the championship will put our collective efforts behind backing the relief funds already in place."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The penultimate race takes place in Malaysia this weekend with Spaniard Jorge Martin top of the standings, ahead of Italy's Francesco Bagnaia, who won the 2023 championship in Valencia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both riders backed a move away from Valencia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day, I think the best solution will be to race elsewhere," said Primac Ducati rider Martin on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Knowing the situation as it is, it's not correct... this could be wrong to race there," said Bagnaia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spanish reports said the Ricardo Tormo racetrack was not affected by the flooding but infrastructure around it was.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other sporting events in the region, including La Liga champions Real Madrid's visit to face Valencia due to take place on Saturday, have been postponed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is not the first time that top level motor sport in Europe has been cancelled because of flooding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 2023 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola, Italy, was cancelled by Formula One organisers after flooding in the region. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ruben Amorim was on Friday named as the new manager of Manchester United, replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old Portuguese coach, who won two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting Lisbon, has signed a deal until 2027 and will join the club on November 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Ruben Amorim as head coach of the men's first team, subject to work visa requirements," the club said on its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He will join until June 2027 with a club option of an additional year, once he has fulfilled his obligations to his current club."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United described Amorim as "one of the most exciting and highly rated young coaches in European football."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ruud van Nistelrooy will continue to take charge of the team until Amorim arrives at Old Trafford.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United sacked Ten Hag on Monday after a 2-1 defeat by West Ham left them languishing 14th in the Premier League, with just three wins from nine matches. (AFP)

    Drivers to hand over phone number or email for licence

   Drivers will have to provide a verified Hong Kong mobile number or email address when applying for or renewing their licence from November 18, the Transport Department announced on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The requirement will enable the police to start issuing any fixed penalty notices by digital means – a move which is set to begin in the first half of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I don't think there is much difficulty because nowadays people get used to technology a lot. What we are changing is only from a paper ticket to an electronic form. All the information is provided in that SMS or email," police superintendent Nip Hoi-kwan said at a press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nip added that he thinks the digitalisation will cut the time officers spend on paperwork for a penalty notice, from around 30 minutes to 15.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Helen Lee, a principal executive officer with the Transport Department, said measures are in place to ensure the security of the information collected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Transport Department adopts the government cloud infrastructure services, which provide a very reliable and secure infrastructure for the Transport Department to collect and keep the personal data collected through the verification platform," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moreover, the data collected will be transferred to our central system immediately, so we will not keep any data in the platform."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Retail sales were down 6.9 percent in September compared to the same month last year, marking the seventh consecutive month of year-on-year declines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official data released on Friday showed that the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.6 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drop followed a revised 10 percent fall in August and an 11.7 percent decrease in July.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic fall, with a 26.7 percent drop.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said a change in consumer patterns will continue to affect the retail sector in the near future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Nevertheless, an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures, and a possible easing of the Hong Kong dollar alongside the US dollar with the commencement of the US interest rate cut, would be conducive to boosting sentiment and supporting spending," a government spokesman said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said the sector is pessimistic about sales for the rest of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's anticipated that many local people will travel abroad during the Christmas period, and certain domestic-related retail categories are expected to see a decline in business," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Due to the absence of Christmas holidays on the mainland, the tourist-related retail categories, such as watches and jewellery, are also expected to perform worse than last year."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan says it's extraordinary that Hong Kong scientists are joining the country's latest Antarctica exploration, with icebreakers Xuelong and Xuelong 2 setting sail along with a third ship on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mission to the South Pole is China's 41st and will last for more than half a year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a ceremony marking the ships' journey, Chan said Hongkongers' participation in the mission marks an important milestone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Not only does this show the country's recognition of Hong Kong's polar scientific research, it also highlights how the SAR can play a pro-active role in the country's scientific research missions," the minister said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan expressed the hope that local scientists can make full use of the country's platform to conduct solid research and make greater contributions to the nation in science and innovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also noted that this year is the 40th anniversary of the start of China's polar expeditions, saying the country's efforts and achievements attract global attention and reflect a powerful nation's responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

   The new mainland additions are Sichuan University, Beihang University, Southeast University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tongji University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Normal University, Nankai University and Tianjin University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The overseas newcomers are the Royal College of Art, University of the Arts London, Parsons School of Design, The New School, and Rhode Island School of Design.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Bureau said that in January, the complete list of universities will be reviewed and subsequently updated, given that their eligibility is based on world rankings which will change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first arrivals under the scheme will see their visas expire in the first quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To make it easier for them to renew their visas, the Immigration Department said it will bring the application period forward, from the current four weeks before expiry, to three months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Labour Chris Sun said extension approvals will be granted based on various factors, such as the person’s income, tax payments and time spent in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Labour Bureau said Category A applicants of the scheme – those who had an annual income of at least HK$2.5 million prior to application – will now have their first visa validity period extended to three years instead of two.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau explained that these people enjoy a better employment rate in Hong Kong compared to other applicants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that almost all of the Category A applicants are married and it hopes a longer visa will encourage them to bring their families to settle down in the SAR.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tuen Mun Hospital revealed on Friday that a patient was administered 10 times the prescribed dose of a sedative last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hospital said the patient is in stable condition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuen Mun Hospital said the individual sought treatment at its accident and emergency department on October 18 and was arranged to transfer to intensive care because of a medical condition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "While in the accident and emergency department, the patient was prescribed sedatives to assist with the subsequent medical procedures. Before being transferred to the intensive care unit, medical staff discovered that the dosage of the sedative injection received by the patient was 10 times the prescribed dosage," a hospital spokesperson said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The patient did not show any abnormal reaction, and is now staying in a general ward.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The hospital is very concerned about the incident, and has contacted the patient's family to explain and apologise," the spokesperson added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hospital said it had reminded staff to follow guidelines on the injection of drugs, while vowing to review the workflow of the accident and emergency unit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuen Mun Hospital has reported the case to the Hospital Authority, and set up a committee to the investigate the root cause and make recommendations for improvements.

    AI tech to scan for abuse at children's home

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Surveillance cameras equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) technology are to be used to look for any signs of abuse at one of the city's residential homes for children, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The AI should automatically raise the alarm if it detects inappropriate behaviour such as children been slapped or shaken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said money for the technology was made available to the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) after its Children's Residential Home in Prince Edward was embroiled in an abuse scandal involving multiple members of staff in 2021.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To help the Society for the Protection of Children improve the quality of care given to children and increase their efficiency in monitoring childcare services, the government has appropriated money from the Lotteries Fund, allowing the society to use AI technology in surveillance cameras, so that inappropriate actions can be identified at an early stage," Sun said at a seminar on child protection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The AI-equipped cameras should be in use from June next year, the minister added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   HKSPC said that two years ago it began monitoring its surveillance camera footage on a weekly basis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are two levels of monitoring, first by Children's Residential Home staff. They will randomly choose two hours of CCTV footage to review and see if there is any misbehaviour or questionable behaviour," said director Subrina Chow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It will then be followed by a second review from a child safeguarding consultant. They will review what has already been reviewed by first level staff, and randomly choose another two hours of footage to see if there is any condition that requires attention."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong will host a general assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) for the first time in 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association, which consists of 206 National Olympic Committees, announced on Thursday that the SAR had won the bid to organise the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association gathers all its members at a general assembly every year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The international sports body plans to organise a five-day gathering in Hong Kong, which will include seminars and an awards ceremony.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement released on Friday, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Secretary, Kevin Yeung, said the successful bid demonstrates international confidence in Hong Kong's capacity to host large-scale sports events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will fully support and guide the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China in hosting this important international meeting, co-ordinating close co-operation between relevant government departments and various sectors including tourism and business," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president of the sports federation and Olympic committee, Timothy Fok, said they will start working with government departments as well as the sports and business sectors to prepare for the assembly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng also said the hosting of the assembly will strengthen the SAR's status as a hub for mega events in Asia.

  <img alt='Applicants for the Quality Migrant Admission System now just need to complete a questionnaire with 12 "yes or no" questions. File photo: RTHK' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777188_1_20241101135842.jpg&q=55" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials on Friday advised tens of thousands of people waiting for months to find out whether they can move to Hong Kong under the Quality Migrant Admission System to scrap their applications and start again via a new process they hope will be quicker.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 80,000 applications are in limbo, with the waiting time for them to be vetted stretching to about nine months, according to the Immigration Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials say the new process they've devised should slash the application process down to about six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Instead of filling out details and having officials score them item by item, from now on applicants will only have to complete an online questionnaire and answer 12 "yes or no" questions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Younger people will no longer get a higher score and applicants now just need to state whether they are 50 or under.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Multiple doctoral or master's degrees won't improve an applicant's chances anymore and they just need to state whether they have one from one of 198 universities covered by the Top Talent Pass Scheme, or one of six business schools ranked among the top ten in the world over the past five years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other ways to get a “yes” include having an annual income of HK$1 million or above, owning a company with an annual profit of HK$5 million or above, or having work experience of five years or more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Being bilingual or having good English writing and speaking skills is another way to get a "yes".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those who get six or more “yesses” on the questionnaire will be referred to a government internal review committee, run by Secretary for Labour Chris Sun, who will then pass its recommendation to the Immigration Department for a final decision.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Bureau said it would advise existing applicants still waiting to find out whether they've been accepted to withdraw their original application and file another one to get a speedier decision.

    'More proactive approach needed to protect children'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children on Friday urged the public and businesses to do their bit to create a safe and positive environment where children can thrive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The call came as the society carried out what it said was the city's first survey on awareness and perception of child safety.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll of more than 1,400 people over the summer found that about 75 percent lacked an understanding of the issue, the group said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[Child safeguarding] is actually a more proactive approach. We look at the entire environment more comprehensively to adopt preventative measures to protect our children," said the society's director, Subrina Chow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The general public needs to understand there are a lot of precautions or preventative measures that organisations, schools, the government, individuals and private enterprises can take to ensure the environment is safe and healthy enough for children to use and experience," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four hundred of those surveyed work with children and 71 percent said they did not receive any training on child protection, while 62 percent were unaware of whether their company has policies in this area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The society said only 37 percent of the workers reported having completed a Sexual Conviction Record Check (SCRC) before starting their jobs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The scheme is important for colleagues who work with children face-to-face and especially those who will work alone with children," Chow said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having the government to mandate the SCRC for certain services would be important, for example residential services, where staff would be staying in the same space with children most of the day, they should definitely go through the check before being allowed to work with children."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The society suggested the government strengthen public awareness on safeguarding children and lay out protection policies.

    Morant leads Grizzlies over Bucks, Rockets hold on

  <img alt="Grizzlies' Morant drives the ball against Bucks guard Damian Lillard. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777176_1_20241101123409.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ja Morant's 12th career triple-double fired the Memphis Grizzlies to a 122-99 NBA victory over the reeling Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday as Houston edged the Dallas Mavericks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, but teammate Damian Lillard was held to four points on 1-of-12 shooting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brook Lopez was Milwaukee's next-highest scorer with 12 points as the Bucks dropped their fourth straight after opening the season with a win over injury-hit Philadelphia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morant was the engine, scoring 26 points with 10 rebounds and 14 assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I just came out being aggressive, took what the defense gave me," said Morant, who piled up 21 points in the first half to help Memphis build a 70-48 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had plenty of support as seven Grizzlies players, including all five starters, scored in double figures. Milwaukee never got the deficit below 18 points in the second half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everybody was kind of in a good rhythm, we got it going early," Morant said after Memphis bounced back from a lethargic loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We got stops," he said. "We were boxing out, we were getting out running, playing our game – that's how we want to play. If we want to do something in this league, that's what we've got to do each and every night."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Bucks are clearly missing the contribution of injured Khris Middleton, who has yet to play this season as he recovers from an ankle injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I thought we played with the right spirit," Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. "We didn't make shots and you're going to have nights like that. But on those nights we have to find a way to get stops.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Morant had a free pass tonight as far as driving – we've got to do a better job of trying to figure out how to contain guards like that," Rivers said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, in Dallas, the Rockets finally got the better of their Texas rivals, leading by as many as 23 points and hanging on for a 108-102 victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jalen Green scored 23 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Rockets, who had lost six of their last seven games against the Mavs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Green scored 11 in the fourth quarter to help the Rockets fend off a late Dallas surge. Dillon Brooks and Alperen Sengun added 17 points apiece for Houston, who out-rebounded Dallas 50-37.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mavs star Luka Doncic scored 15 of his 29 points in the final period, his step back three-pointer with 1:08 remaining pulling Dallas within three points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amen Thompson and Brooks responded with baskets and the Rockets held on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kyrie Irving scored 28 points for the Mavs, but Klay Thompson was the only other Dallas player to score in double figures with 12. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   More than 30 people reportedly suffered minor injuries and one was more seriously hurt on Friday when a ferry collided with a pier in Central.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A vessel operated by Tsui Wah Ferry smashed into Central Pier No 9 as it was docking there at around 7am, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chartered ferry had earlier left Tsim Sha Tsui and was to take workers to an HK Electric construction site in Lamma.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Assistant Divisional Officer Hung Shing-yau from the Fire Services Department said the 34 injured passengers were taken to hospital for treatment, with one of them suffering rather serious injuries to the back and hand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hung added that there were 118 passengers and two members of staff on board the vessel at the time, with the rescue operation completed in around 20 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Senior Marine Officer Cory Keung said an investigation is underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “After the inspection, the ship... is not seriously [damaged]. No water intake and no oil pollution was found,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The last inspection was conducted in March this year and all was in good condition.”

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A worker was rescued on Friday morning after being suspended mid-air from a building in Kowloon Bay for about an hour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident happened at around 9am when a suspended platform fell from the sixth floor of Telford House on Wang Hoi Road, leaving a worker hanging by his safety harness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is understood that the man was carrying out maintenance work on the building's exterior when a suspected mechanical failure caused the platform to drop.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emergency personnel were called to the scene and brought the worker to ground safely.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Halloween has helped bring thousands of revellers out to wine and dine in the city's night clubs, with Lan Kwai Fong chairman Allan Zeman calling it the busiest he could remember.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was probably the busiest I've ever seen and I started Lan Kwai Fong about 30 years ago," Zeman told Hong Kong Today.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He estimated that more than 60,000 people came out to celebrate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ahead of the big night, some bar representatives had forecast a 10 percent rise in sales, but Zeman said many businesses reported a revenue surge of 25 percent or more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said Hongkongers were in the mood to celebrate after some tough years and there was pent-up demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was just a sea of bodies and costumes and just people having the greatest time that they've ever had. I've never seen so many people come out (to Halloween)," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zeman said there was a good mix of revellers, with about 25 percent from mainland China. Another 15 to 20 percent were westerners - probably tourists - and the rest were locals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said many bars and clubs were booked up two weeks in advance, including reservations made a month in advance "which we've never ever had before".

    Spain flooding death toll rises to 158

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain mourned at least 158 deaths on Friday as authorities told people in flood-stricken regions to stay at home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An exceptionally powerful Mediterranean storm from Tuesday unleashed heavy rains and torrents of mud-filled water that swept away people and wrecked homes, with the eastern Valencia region hit hardest.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The body coordinating rescue work in Valencia announced 155 bodies had been recovered there by Thursday afternoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials in Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia had announced a combined three deaths in their regions on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But "dozens and dozens" of people remain missing two days after the start of the catastrophe, government minister Angel Victor Torres told reporters, raising fears the death toll could rise further.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some rural areas also remain inaccessible to rescuers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Please, stay at home... follow the calls of the emergency services," pleaded Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European officials pointed on Thursday to the floods in Spain as a reminder of the self-harming effects of humans' destruction of nature, urging delegates at a deadlocked UN biodiversity conference in Colombia to "act."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European Commission envoy Florika Fink-Hooijer said the "catastrophe" in the Valencia region highlighted the link between biodiversity loss and human-caused climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Worsening droughts and flooding cause the loss of plant species such as trees -- which serve as a bulwark against some of the worst effects of global warming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If we act on biodiversity, we at least can buffer some of the climate impacts," Fink-Hooijer said at a press conference in the city of Cali, host of the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the UN's Convention on Biodiversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At this COP we really have a chance to act," said the envoy, who is also the European Commission director-general for environment. (AFP)

    Hong Kong to relaunch Islamic finance drive: Paul Chan
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is ready to relaunch its drive to develop Islamic finance, after a three-day trip to the Saudi capital Riyadh opened his eyes to the untapped potential of developing more financial products that comply with Islamic law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the visit, the Hong Kong delegation led by the finance chief signed 10 memoranda of understanding to further cooperation between the two sides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreements covered areas from mutual investment to collaborations in technology and innovation development, while a local tech firm signed on to launch insurance products with two Saudi companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters on Thursday to conclude his visit, Chan said his exchanges made it apparent that Saudi Arabia is more interested in the Hong Kong, mainland and Asian markets than he had previously thought.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told reporters that he came to understand that the kingdom wants to attract different sources of funding to support its infrastructure and industrial development, and hence there’s a demand for diverse forms of financing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Previously, we thought that market demand for Islamic finance wasn't that high. But after talking to them, we think we'll relaunch Islamic finance soon," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They have to do a lot of infrastructure work. During our exchanges with them, we discussed Islamic finance, as well as using funds raised from issuing green and sustainable bonds in the Hong Kong bond market to support them."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Islamic finance involves business transactions that are in full compliance with Islamic law – and which prohibits any involvement with, for example, gambling, alcohol and pork, while interest payments are also banned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The finance minister also revealed that the Future Investment Initiative, or FII Institute, is eager to stage the FII Priority Summit in Hong Kong again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He pointed out that Saudi Arabia is very interested in research and development of technologies, and welcomes SAR companies to set up shop in the kingdom.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saudi Arabia found that it is worth taking reference to Hong Kong's way of nurturing start-ups and talent, according to Chan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They think that our way of nurturing talent through two parks and offering funds to support them, or even the tailor-made listing regime that allows start-ups without profits and income to be listed, is very worth taking reference to."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for nurturing talent, their insurance authority recently went to Hong Kong for an exchange with the local authority. They want to send someone to Hong Kong on secondment, so as to introduce some of our practice to the country. I think this is a good thing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also said there was no need to adjust Hong Kong’s full-year economic growth forecast, even though the city’s third quarter growth has slowed to 1.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "During the announcement of the Financial Budget at the beginning of this year, we expected the economy to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent. I think that the growth could still be within this range. Therefore there's no need to adjust it," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that the government will remain both cautious and optimistic.

    Yao Ming steps down as Chinese basketball chief

  <div class="itemFullText">
   NBA legend Yao Ming has quit as head of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) after seven years in the job because of the national team's poor performances, he said Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Basketball is immensely popular in China and the former Rockets centre is the country's most famous star, even after he retired from playing in 2011.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yao told state news agency Xinhua that he was standing down because "the performances and results of the national team have regrettably not met expectations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 44-year-old has previously been critical of the men's national team, labelling the players "slackers" and warning there was a "huge gap" between them and the world's best teams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said last year he would "take responsibility" after they failed to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CBA confirmed it had approved his resignation on Thursday, saying his decision came "after careful consideration and based on considerations for the development of China's basketball and personal planning".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has chosen to depart with about two years left on his term to allow the association a full Olympic cycle to improve the team, Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A CBA statement quoted Yao as saying that "basketball is a career I have always adored, whether in the past, present or future".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope that everyone will continue to support Chinese basketball with me in the future," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CBA said the national sport administration "expressed sincere gratitude" to Yao for his work.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is believed that Yao Ming has done a lot of fruitful work in building the foundation of bringing basketball to the masses – and improving the level of the national team", the association said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yao "is still a member of the Chinese basketball family and we believe he will continue to contribute to Chinese basketball", it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His successor, Guo Zhenming, pledged to deepen reforms in the domestic game and help China become a basketball heavyweight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Taking the baton of leading the CBA is a heavy responsibility and a glorious mission," Guo was quoted as saying. (AFP)

    Boeing sweetens offer for striking workers

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US aviation giant Boeing has improved the conditions in its contract offer to thousands of striking workers, with a 38 percent wage increase over four years and a ratification bonus, their union said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, which represents more than 33,000 workers who went on strike on September 13 in the Seattle area, has endorsed the contract, and scheduled a vote on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Your union is endorsing and recommending the latest IAM/Boeing contract proposal. It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory," the IAM chapter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was the fourth offer made by Boeing since early September, but the third on which members have been asked to vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Members overwhelmingly rejected an offer of a 25 percent raise over four years on September 12. A second offer, which promised a 35 percent pay rise, was rejected by nearly two-thirds of members last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The union has consistently asked for a 40 percent salary increase.
   <br/>

   "We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success," the union said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beyond the 38 percent wage increase, members will be entitled to a US$12,000 ratification bonus, up from US$7,000 in the previous offer, Boeing said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We encourage all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4," Boeing said in a statement. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Leading MotoGP riders called Thursday for the season finale in a fortnight to be moved out of Valencia because of deadly once-in-a-generation flooding in Spain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 95 people have been killed and troops, police and firefighters are racing to find survivors and victims in the Valencia region of the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The MotoGP world title could go down to the final race weekend of the campaign, scheduled for the Circuit Ricardo Tormo just outside Valencia on November 16-17.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day, I think the best solution will be to race elsewhere," said Spain's Jorge Martín, who tops the championship ahead of Italy's title-holder Francesco Bagnaia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in Sepang ahead of this weekend's Malaysia GP, the 26-year-old called on the sport's bosses to make a decision on a possible change of venue as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The best thing would be to know right now so you approach the weekend in a different way," said the Pramac Ducati rider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Title rival Bagnaia, who is still in the fight just 17 points back, said the Spanish people "are living their worst dream".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Knowing the situation as it is, it's not correct – this could be wrong to race there. If it was my choice, I'd prefer not to race there. We have many other options," said the Ducati rider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Valencia track itself has not been damaged but there are question marks about some of the other infrastructure needed to host thousands of fans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Márquez said the priority must be the recovery effort and not racing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Up to a year's rain fell in a few hours on the eastern city of Valencia and the surrounding region on Tuesday, sending torrents of water and mud through towns and cities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As a Spaniard, it's super-difficult to see these kinds of images," said Márquez. "Theorically, we have a GP there – but now I think all the facilities of the government, of Spain, need to go to the people who lost their houses."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain on Thursday started three days of mourning. (AFP)

    Alcaraz stunned by 18th-seed Humbert at Paris Masters

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number two Carlos Alcaraz was knocked out of the Paris Masters by 18th-ranked Ugo Humbert of France who swept to a third round victory in three sets on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Left-handed Humbert came through 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 to register his first win over the French Open and Wimbledon champion having lost twice to the Spanish star earlier in 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a testing evening for Alcaraz who was 0-5 down in the first set before he managed to get on the board.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just super proud of myself that I did it," said Humbert who has won titles in Marseille and Dubai this season. "It was a crazy match, a crazy atmosphere."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I went for every shot," added Humbert, looking back on his first set blitz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's why I think I had less energy in the second set, and after the third it was a mountain that was with me to the end," he said. "I trusted myself in big moments and I made some big shots."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old Alcaraz has endured a rollercoaster second half of the season since his heartbreaking Paris Olympics final loss to Novak Djokovic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a very intense match," admitted Alcaraz. "I started with some doubts about my game. Against a player who attacks whenever he can, who hits very aggressively at the slightest opportunity, it wasn't easy to get into the match."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I was not up to the level he displayed," he added. "Ugo's performance was really high – the way he hits the ball is incredible."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcraz was knocked out in the second round of the US Open by 74th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp, and defeated top-ranked Jannik Sinner in the Beijing final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He then suffered a quarter-final exit at the hands of Tomas Machac, the world number 33, at the Shanghai Masters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Humbert goes on to face Australia's Jordan Thompson for a place in the Paris Masters semi-finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The French number one just edged Alcaraz in winners on Thursday with 28 to 23 with both men committing 38 unforced errors. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Major US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday after Microsoft and Meta Platforms highlighted growing artificial intelligence costs that could hit their earnings, curbing enthusiasm for megacaps that have fueled the market rally this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and Microsoft fell, despite both companies beating earnings estimates in results reported after the bell on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks also slipped. Amazon and Apple dropped ahead of their quarterly results. Shares of Alphabet, which reported on Tuesday, also fell.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You had three of the Magnificent Seven all say they basically have open-ended budgets for AI spend and investors don't like to hear that," said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The intermediate and longer-term implications of this buildout are really important for US long-term growth and long-term productivity. ... In the short run, investors are asking where's the profit from it?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Microsoft and Meta both said their capital expenses were growing due to AI investments, which could reduce profitability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow fell 0.9 percent, to finish at 41,763. The S&P lost 1.9 percent, to 5,705, and the Nasdaq fell 2.8 percent, to 18,095.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, rose 0.2 percent in September, in line with economists' expectations. However, the core figure was 2.7 percent year-over-year, slightly above the 2.6 percent forecast, while consumer spending increased a little more than expected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the data, traders stuck to bets for a 25-basis-point rate reduction in the Fed's November meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We do expect them to cut by a quarter (percentage point) next week because there is nothing in the data this week that should throw them off of that," Schleif said. (Reuters)

    Brussels launches investigation into Temu

  <img alt="The probe is being launched under a mammoth law known as the Digital Services Act. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777069_1_20241031192419.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The EU launched a formal investigation on Thursday into Chinese-founded e-commerce platform Temu on suspicion the site is doing too little to stop the sale of illegal products, in a probe that could lead to large fines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Extremely popular in the European Union despite having entered the continent's market only last year, Temu has on average around 92 million monthly active users in the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The investigation will also look at dangers from the platform's "potentially addictive design" that could have "negative consequences" on users' "physical and mental well-being," said the European Commission, the EU's powerful digital watchdog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The probe is being launched under a mammoth law known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) that forces the world's largest tech firms to do more to protect European consumers online.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We want to ensure that Temu is complying with the Digital Services Act. Particularly in ensuring that products sold on their platform meet EU standards and do not harm consumers," EU tech chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU wants to know more about the systems Temu has in place to "limit the sale" of illegal products as well as how the platform restricts their "reappearance".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu will also have to explain what measures it is taking to address any risks from its service, including game-like reward programmes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu said it would cooperate with the EU.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Temu takes its obligations under the DSA seriously, continuously investing to strengthen our compliance system and safeguard consumer interests on our platform," a Temu spokesperson said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will cooperate fully with regulators to support our shared goal of a safe, trusted marketplace for consumers," the spokesperson said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU probe will also look at Temu's systems and how they recommend content and products to users as well as whether the platform is complying with the obligation to give researchers access to Temu's publicly available data, the commission said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu will also have to provide more details about the "parameters" of its recommender systems, which are used by platforms to push more personalised content.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU stressed that the "opening of formal proceedings does not prejudge its outcome" and there is no deadline for the probe's completion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu is among 25 "very large" online platforms that must comply with the DSA or risk fines that could reach as high as six percent of their global turnover, or even a ban for serious and repeated violations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other shopping platforms that must comply with the DSA include Chinese online retailer AliExpress, US giant Amazon and Chinese-founded Shein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other DSA investigations have targeted AliExpress, social media platform X, which is owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk and used to be called Twitter, as well as Facebook and Instagram owned by Meta. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by eight percent in 2023 but the cuts being made are falling short of EU targets, the European Environment Agency (EEA) reported on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following this "largest year-on-year reduction in several decades," emissions were now 37 percent below 1990 levels, the EEA said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The huge drop was led by a significant decline in coal use and growth of renewable energy sources and supported by reduced energy consumption across Europe," said an agency statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The share of renewable energy in Europe's energy consumption has risen from 10.2 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in 2023, the agency said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Based on existing measures, projections signal a 43 percent reduction in net emissions in EU countries by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, falling short of the 55 percent target set by the EU, the agency warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that "22 member states have submitted additional projections that include planned but not yet launched measures."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Together, these would reduce net emissions in the EU by 49 percent below 1990 levels in 2030," the EEA said, coming closer but still falling short of the target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To close the remaining gap by 2030, it is essential that emissions reductions continue at a swift pace over the coming years," the EEA said. (AFP)

   The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Xia Baolong has met Polytechnic University Council Chairman Lam Tai-fai and its President Teng Jin-guang in Beijing.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   He pointed out that Hong Kong’s major universities shoulder the important mission of fostering virtues, adding they should not only devote themselves to this mission, but should also give firm support to the Chief Executive and the SAR government, and together work to level up higher education in the territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xia fully affirmed the work of the PolyU, saying it has pulled together in recent years and achieved excellent results in areas such as research and innovation, and had contributed to major national projects.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said central authorities firmly support the Hong Kong SAR in developing the education sector in accordance with the “One Country, Two Systems” principle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xia expressed the hope that all tertiary institutions in the SAR will focus on the needs of the country and the strengths of Hong Kong and harness the strength of the “One Country Two Systems” principle to keep up with the times and strive to foster talented people to help realise national rejuvenation.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation has conducted its first dual aircraft carrier formation exercise in the South China Sea, state media said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Broadcaster CCTV said the drills involving the Liaoning and Shandong that took place "in an area of the South China Sea" intended to "hone and enhance the combat capability of the aircraft carrier formation system”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a post accompanied by a video of jets taking off from and landing on the two carriers, CCTV said the exercises also took place in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Xinhua News Agency said the drills “featured multiple subjects under real-combat circumstances”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The reports did not specify when the exercises took place, though they said the broader naval mission had overlapped with public holidays that spanned late September to October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, having been commissioned in 2012. The Shandong entered service in 2019, while a third carrier, the Fujian, is undergoing sea trials. (Additional reporting by AFP)
