  <div class="itemFullText">
   There may be fresh hope for prostate cancer patients who develop resistance to traditional forms of therapies, as oncologists say a new third-line treatment is showing promising results so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology said the targeted radiotherapy treatment -- lutetium-177-PSMA-617 -- can boost cancer survival rates and improve patients' quality of life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Half of the patients also reported a reduction in tumour size, while others had cancer cells completely eradicated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The treatment is brought in when the patient no longer reacts to both hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, and presents symptoms such as difficulty in urinating, blood in urine, and even spinal cord pain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Clinical oncologist Kenneth Wong pointed out the treatment is also associated with less side effects.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are certainly some side effects associated with the use of this drug, including dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, anaemia and so on," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But that is still better than traditional chemotherapy, Wong stressed, in which patients have to deal with suppressed bone marrow function and an increased risk of infection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The theranostic medicine is administered intravenously every six weeks, for up to six sessions. It locates cancer cells in the body and delivers targeted radiation to kill those cells.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said patients are required to drink large amounts of water to purge the remnants of the drug which are not absorbed by the tumour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They should also avoid close contact with people for up to two weeks, especially children and pregnant women.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each injection costs HK$100,000 and public hospital patients have to pay out of their own pockets. Charity group St James' Settlement currently provides a subsidy of up to HK$30,000 for each treatment programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prostate cancer was the third most common cancer among men in Hong Kong in 2021. More than half of the patients were only diagnosed at an advanced stage.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US stocks closed slightly lower after a choppy session on Monday, as investors prepared for a crucial week in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve will release a policy statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both scrambled for an edge in the last full day of a race that polls show as extremely close. It could take days to determine the victor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some of the so-called "Trump trades" unwound after a recent poll showed Harris, the Democratic vice president, leading in Iowa, sparking a drop in the US dollar, Treasury yields and bitcoin. Trump Media & Technology Group closed up 12.4 percent, bouncing back from early losses of nearly 6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257 points, or 0.6 percent, to 41,794, the S&P 500 lost 16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,712 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,179.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors were largely pricing in a Fed interest rate cut of 25 basis points at its policy announcement on Thursday, with CME's FedWatch Tool showing markets pricing in a 98 percent chance of a cut, with only a 2 percent chance the central bank keeps rates steady.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors was energy, up 1.9 percent as oil prices climbed after OPEC+ decided to delay plans for an output increase. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Vladimir Putin (left) and Choe Son Hui (right) have held a meeting in the Kremlin. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777559_1_20241105021718.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Putin met North Korea's foreign minister in the Kremlin on Monday amid mounting concern in the West that North Korean soldiers are about to enter the Ukraine war on Moscow's side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Video of the meeting showed the pair shaking hands for a full minute as Putin greeted Choe Son Hui.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin noted that they were meeting on Russia's National Unity Day, a public holiday, and Choe conveyed "sincere, warm, comradely greetings" from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States says North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to Russia, including 8,000 to the western Kursk region where Russia is still battling to expel Ukrainian troops who broke across the border in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin, who signed a treaty with Kim in June that includes a mutual defence clause, has neither confirmed nor denied the North Korean troop presence. He has said that Russia is free to implement the pact as it sees fit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Russian leader briefly alluded to the military situation in Kursk when he met youth volunteers earlier on Monday, telling them: "When the enemy is cleaned out from the region, there will be lots of work for you to do."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said he had discussed with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock the "need for decisive action" in response to North Korean involvement in the war in Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said North Korean troops were waging "an aggressive war in Europe against a sovereign European state".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week urged Kyiv's allies to stop just "watching" and start taking action to tackle the presence of the North Koreans. (Reuters)

  <img alt="South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul (left) and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell (centre right) attend a meeting in Seoul. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777539_1_20241104194635.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia as Moscow wages war in Ukraine highlights the need for security cooperation between the European Union and South Korea, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The deployment "regrettably illustrates the importance of our shared security agenda," he said before talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Seoul. The EU and South Korea are holding their first Strategic Dialogue meeting after Washington and Seoul sounded the alarm about North Korea sending troops to help Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Borrell also met South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and expressed concern over the development, the South Korean defence ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an existential threat," Borrell said in a post on X and also posted a photo of him shaking hands with Kim. "The Republic of Korea is best positioned to understand it. We are united in our support to Ukraine. I encouraged them to step it up."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Borrell said in a post on X on Sunday that he had visited the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas after arriving in South Korea following a trip to Japan, and described the visit as reminder of the need to invest more in peace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said in another post that he was visiting South Korea to take security and defence cooperation between the EU and Seoul to "the next level", but gave no further details. Cho said last week that all possible scenarios were under consideration, when asked about whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea aiding Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but has resisted Kyiv's requests for weapons.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul also sees it as likely that the North will be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington expects North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, to enter the fight against Ukraine soon, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At talks in Moscow on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country intended to back Russia until it achieves victory in the Ukraine war. (Reuters)

  <img alt="The government of Anthony Albanese is seeking to overcome workforce shortages. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777538_1_20241104194245.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Australia will spend A$600 million (US$395 million) on defence reserve recruitment and extending a cash bonus to retain troops as the centre-left Albanese government seeks to overcome workforce shortages, officials are expected to announce on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A review of Australia's defence force last year identified severe workforce pressures as a priority issue, even as the government lifts its defence budget to a record A$51.5 billion annually, revamping its northern military bases and acquiring long range strike capabilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A defence workforce plan expected to be released on Tuesday cites a competitive national labour market and record low levels of unemployment as putting pressure on defence's ability to recruit, according to excerpts viewed by Reuters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A bonus scheme introduced last year will be extended until 2028 and expanded through the middle ranks, offering A$40,000 to defence force members who stay to "address hollowness in the force", the plan says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Department of Defence aims to achieve a permanent defence workforce of 69,000 by the early 2030s, with an overall combined defence and civilian workforce of around 100,000 by 2040, the plan says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In June, there were around 57,000 permanent defence personnel, falling short of funded positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our ADF personnel are our greatest capability, which is why it is crucial that the Defence workforce has the people it needs to help protect Australia’s strategic interests," Defence Minister Richard Marles said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia is spending up to A$368 billion to acquire nuclear powered submarines under the Aukus partnership with the United States and Britain, and has also allocated A$74 billion for missile systems, as it responds to rising tensions with China in the Indo Pacific region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, Australia cancelled a multibillion-dollar military satellite project with Lockheed Martin, saying it would instead shift its focus to a multi-orbit system to increase resilience for the Australian Defence Force. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Fanling Magistrates' Court on Monday sentenced a 23-year-old mainland student for using fake academic credentials to apply for a master's degree at a Hong Kong university.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said the man had passed an online interview for the Health and Physical Education programme at Education University, and received a conditional offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was then asked to submit his qualifications, including an English proficiency test.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Upon verification the institution realised the actual score attained by the applicant did not match his claim, and reported the case to police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man pleaded guilty to a count of attempting to obtain services by deception.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police warned people against using bogus academic qualifications, saying it will adopt a zero-tolerance approach to maintain the reputation of Hong Kong's higher education.

   Education officials on Monday said the results of this year’s Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), which tests students on the subjects of Chinese, English and maths, remained “generally steady”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Primary three students’ scores were all slightly down this year in all the subjects, with an 80.9 percent, 78.7 percent, and 85.3 percent proficiency in Chinese, English and maths respectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secondary three pupils did better in Chinese and maths this year, but their English proficiency was down from last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As compared to that of last year, the performance of the primary three and secondary three students participating in the assessment of the three major subjects of Chinese Language, English Language and mathematics this year remains generally steady," the Education Bureau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that it will use different ways to help enhance learning and teaching effectiveness.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A pharmacist on Monday said regulations on short-acting anaesthetics were not strong enough to deter their recreational use.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong has this year recorded at least three deaths caused by the suspected usage of “space oil” this year, according to the Toxicology Reference Laboratory of the Hong Kong Poison Control Centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Often inhaled through vapes, “space oil” usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor. The anaesthetic is classified as a Part 1 poison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Hong Kong So Yiu-wah said the long-term use of etomidate could be deadly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The drug will suppress the cortisol level inside our body. Once the cortisol is lowered, then our blood potassium will also be lowered, making muscles, especially the legs, seem very weak," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because the potassium level is low, the heartbeat may become irregular. If those people already have some heart disease, it may be even fatal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said penalties for the illegal use of the drug are not stringent enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The penalty is high not enough, because for those people who violate the [regulation], the maximum penalty is a HK$100,000 [fine] and being kept in jail for two years,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is seeking to list the sedative as a dangerous drug in the first half of 2025, according to security minister Chris Tang, who also said taking “space oil” would be equivalent to taking drugs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If etomidate is listed as a dangerous drug, those illegally possessing or consuming “space oil” containing the substance would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Monday arrested a man who allegedly attempted to attack a magistrate with a knife inside Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case took place shortly after 10am, when the court was in session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As proceedings were under way, the 32-year-old suspect allegedly emerged from the public gallery and charged towards the magistrate, while pulling out a knife from his bag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A police officer intervened quickly and the man never got to the magistrate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man then tried to flee the scene but was subdued outside the courtroom. Three officers suffered minor injuries in the process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suspect was later arrested on suspicion of attempted wounding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Superintendent Gar Kam-lam told reporters at a briefing that the man was carrying four knives of 27 to 46cm long, as well as flammable liquids and lighters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gar also confirmed the suspect was convicted of indecent assault in 2020, and was awaiting appeal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He brought along documents and papers which suggested he was upset with the ruling," Gar said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sources suggest Edward Wong was the presiding magistrate for that case. The same magistrate was at the court this morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are currently no security checks at most of the city's Magistrates' Courts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The judiciary said it will "progressively implement enhanced security measures" from Tuesday, including screenings and extra manpower.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will also liaise with police on strengthening patrols and ensure the safety of judges, judicial officers, court staff and users.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Department of Justice strongly condemned the case, saying any threat to judicial officers’ personal safety cannot be tolerated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Bar Association, for its part, also condemned the case "in the strongest possible terms".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said any threat or violent act made with the intent to frighten or pressure judicial officers, or retaliate against their decisions is a serious assault on judicial independence.

  <img alt="Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic "Thriller" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died on Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing," the family said in a statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalogue that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for "Roots" and "In the Heat of the Night," organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World" and was among the featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honours likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the “King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For “Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing “Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the best-selling album of all time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The list of his honours and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Centre tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author. (AP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Director of Water Supplies on Monday said officials are investigating what caused a pipe burst that resulted in a water outage in Tung Chung, and apologised to those affected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tung Chung was cut off from fresh water for about 12 hours because urgent repairs on a 1.2 metre-diameter pipe were needed following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities said they originally planned to turn the taps back on at 6am on Monday, but fresh water only returned to Tung Chung at 10am.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Roger Wong apologised to the 120,000 affected residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because of the site constraints, and also because of the special failure mode of this incident, we take time to investigate and find out the leakage point,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The leakage point is also at the bottom of the pipe, so it is hard to carry out the repair works. That's why the progress of [repair] works has been slightly delayed."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong added more time was needed to find out the exact cause and a report will be submitted to the Development Bureau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Built in the 1990s, the burst water pipe is the only one servicing the Tung Chung area.

    Exchange Fund sees record income for first nine months

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's Exchange Fund recorded a record-breaking investment income of HK$224.7 billion for the first nine months of the year, the Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fund posted gains of HK$114.6 billion in the third quarter alone, with the largest gain coming from bond investments, which contributed HK$66 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investments in Hong Kong stocks posted gains for the second consecutive quarter, adding about HK$22 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gains from other stocks totalled HK$18 billion while the valuation of foreign exchange brought in HK$8 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The figure for the first three quarters saw the investment income falling just HK$40 billion short of the total annual record of HK$264 billion in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, the HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said it is difficult to tell if this year’s annual figure will set a new record.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’ve got two more months to go, and the financial market, even a week or month, is a very long period. During those two months, even within this week, we are seeing different developments that will have an impact on the market,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For example, the pace of the US interest rate reduction is still unknown. The market is expecting that at the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting this week, the Federal Reserve will continue with the reduction path, with a cut of let's say 25 basis points as expected by the market. But what the commentary will be, and how they will assess the forward path will have an impact on the market.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yue also noted factors – such as whether China will announce more economic stimulus measures, as well as uncertainties arising from the geopolitical conditions – will influence the fund’s performance.

    Morales vows to continue his defiance of Bolivian govt

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Bolivia's former President Evo Morales insisted on Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales' supporters have blocked roads and caused disruptions around the country in protest against what they say is the government's political persecution of the former Bolivian leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics five years after his ouster, spoke on his third day without food from Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,” Morales told reporters from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he long has led.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former president said he began his hunger strike on Friday in the hope that "international organisations or friendly governments" would facilitate talks with his political nemesis, President Luis Arce .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters set up crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — Morales' former economy minister with whom he is now vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since mid-October, protesters have choked off major highways in defiance of an attempt by Arce's government to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only indigenous-majority nation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, the disruptions in transport have cost the South American country more than US$1.7 billion, according to Bolivia's government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales has denied any wrongdoing and rejects the charges as politically motivated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “My crime is being indigenous,” he said on Sunday. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong’s justice secretary on Monday said the SAR is well positioned to be a hub for legal and economic collaboration, with Beijing saying it will give its unwavering support to back the SAR in its role as a super-connector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the opening of Hong Kong Legal Week, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam said the SAR serves as a gateway between China, the Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Under the One Country, Two Systems principle, Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction within China. Our strong legal foundation, coupled with our close ties with and support from the mainland, position us as a critical hub for legal and economic collaboration across the region and beyond," Lam said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also said efforts to set up a training academy for international legal talents are underway, with a ceremony set to take place on Friday to mark the new initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The academy – first outlined in last year’s Policy Address – will regularly organise training courses, seminars and international exchange programmes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also speaking at the event, Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry’s Office in Hong Kong Cui Jianchun, said the central government’s unwavering commitment to the One Country, Two Systems principle is the strongest foundation for the territory’s development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He called on the SAR to continue to boost its unique role as a super-connector to facilitate trade and investment between Chinese and foreign enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another role that the territory could play, Cui noted, would be uniting diverse market participants and expanding international connections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We believe Hong Kong's uniqueness not only serves and links the mainland with the international community, [but also] we believe here, the common law, the unique law system, can pave the way for the development of the international community."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The commissioner added the SAR could act as a bridge for multicultural interactions, facilitating legal assistance and cooperation, as well as the exchange of legal experience.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least six people died after a volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted several times overnight, officials said on Monday, raising the alert level to the highest of a four-tiered system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, located on the popular tourist island of Flores, spewed a tower of ash and lava on nearby villages that were forced to evacuate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to our coordination with the local authorities, six fatalities have been confirmed," Abdul Muhari, spokesman of the country's disaster management agency said on Monday in an interview on Kompas TV.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Video clips showed villages near the volcano covered by thick ash, with some areas on fire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's volcanology agency raised the alert level to the highest mark, and told locals and tourists not to carry out activities within a seven-kilometre radius of the crater.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There has been a significant increase in volcanic activity on Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki," it said in a press release.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It warned there was a potential for rain-induced lava floods and told locals to wear masks to avoid the effects of volcanic ash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mountain had several major eruptions in January, prompting authorities at the time to raise the alert status to the highest level and evacuate at least 2,000 residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent eruptions due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of intense volcanic and seismic activity. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A tense battle in Seattle saw the Los Angeles Rams come away with a 26-20 overtime NFL win on Demarcus Robinson's one-handed catch of a 39-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Seahawks had scored on a 14-yard touchdown in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, but could not score on the opening drive of the extra session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the Rams needing only a field goal after stuffing the Seahawks on fourth down on the first possession of overtime, Stafford went for the win by throwing a deep ball to Robinson, who was well covered by cornerback Riq Woolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stafford threw for 298 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Rams, who have now won three straight after losing four of their previous five.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions dominated the Green Bay Packers in a 24-14 victory at rain-lashed Lambeau Field on Sunday, winning the battle for supremacy in the NFC North division.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Detroit's Kerby Joseph returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown to help the Lions take control in the highly anticipated matchup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Green Bay struck for an early field goal, but the Lions took the lead for good when quarterback Jared Goff hit Amon-Ra St. Brown with a three-yard touchdown pass in the first minute of the second quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They added a field goal and a touchdown in the final minute of the first half as Joseph reeled in a pass from an under-pressure Packers quarterback Jordan Love and raced up the sideline to the end zone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Detroit scored 24 points before the Packers produced a second field goal. A late Green Bay touchdown made the score more respectable, but the Lions were in control throughout as they improved to 7-1 – the best record in the NFC – for the first time since 1956.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a fun game," Goff said. "In Green Bay, in Lambeau, we're supposed to be the 'dome team' – we're supposed to be the team that can't play outside – and we came in here and win." (AFP/AP)

    Tung Chung fresh water supply restored

  <img alt="The Water Supplies Department says it ordered water trucks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777463_1_20241104104544.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Authorities on Monday said that water supply to Tung Chung was restored shortly after 10am, after the area was cut off from fresh water for about 12 hours due to urgent overnight repairs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Water Supplies Department had originally planned to restore the supply of water at 6am but was forced to delay it several times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Islands District Councillor Lau Chin-pang told RTHK the arrangements were unsatisfactory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think the delay is not good for our residents because 7am to 8am is the most important time for the students and for the workers. So I don't think it's a suitable case. I think they can improve,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Huizaifa, a food delivery worker who lives in Yat Tung Estate in Tung Chung, was one of the affected residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Now I go to work [but there was] just a little water only [for] face wash… I feel very bad because when I came home, no water and when I go toilet no [water]” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a wet market, an angry congee shop owner surnamed Fu said no water meant no business.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Of course the water outage has a huge impact, affecting the whole world. It makes things very inconvenient. Everything needs water. Even if you want to eat, there’s nothing to eat. So there’s no business,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department said earlier that it ordered water trucks and water tanks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said the repairs for the 1,200-millimetre-diameter fresh-water pipe were needed following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A department document said the works is a key facility to supply water to Tung Chung, Hong Kong International Airport, Tai Ho, and Discovery Bay.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   New Zealand captain Tom Latham on Sunday said his team's 3-0 Test sweep in India was one of the "greatest series wins" for the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Black Caps won the third Test by 25 runs on Sunday at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium to hand India only their second series whitewash at home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand – cricket's perennial underdogs – turned around their fortunes from a 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka in September to make India suffer their first Test series loss at home in 12 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's obviously a great moment for New Zealand cricket, probably one of New Zealand cricket's greatest series wins I think," said Latham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Again, all we can do is keep playing cricket and keep playing our brand of cricket," he added. "We've felt a lot of support over the last couple of weeks, which is really special."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand host England for three Tests starting November 28 in Christchurch followed by matches in Wellington and Hamilton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We've got three more big games back home," said Latham. "We've got sell-out crowds in a couple of the games – which is all you can ask for from a cricketer's point of view."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mumbai-born New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel stood out in the final Test with a match-haul of 11 wickets with his left-arm spin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He took five in the first innings and then six to help bowl out India for 121 in their chase of 147 and Latham praised his match-winner as "fantastic". (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Three-time world champion Max Verstappen produced a virtuoso drive in often atrocious conditions to regain control of this year's world championship on Sunday when he charged from 17th on the grid to win the Brazilian Grand Prix.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Without a win in 10 races since the Spanish Grand Prix in May, Red Bull's series leader made light of the chaotic, rain-swept conditions to register a 62nd career triumph and fastest lap while nearest title rival Lando Norris of McLaren went from pole position to sixth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dutchman's triumph lifted him to 393 points, increasing his advantage over Norris, on 331, to 62 with just three Grands Prix and one sprint race remaining.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verstappen finished 19.477 seconds ahead of Alpine's French duo of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly with Mercedes' George Russell fourth and Charles Leclerc fifth for Ferrari in a tumultuous contest of accidents, two red-flag stoppages, penalties and planned post-race investigations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Alpine, the reward was a leap from ninth to sixth in the constructors championship, reportedly valued at an estimated US$50 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris, who struggled to find his usual pace, came home sixth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, RB's Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verstappen's success came on the day he overhauled Michael Schumacher's record of leading the drivers standings for 896 days while many of his rivals faced post-race investigations for various sporting misdemeanours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My emotions have been a rollercoaster today – that unlucky qualifying and starting 17th made it such a tough race, but we stayed out of trouble, made the right calls and it is unbelievable to win here from so far back," said Verstappen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What a day," said a beaming Ocon. "After this difficult season, it's so nice to drive here and the rain levelled out the performance so I am very happy." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Germany's Alexander Zverev won the Paris Masters on Sunday by defeating home hope Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-2 in a dominant display by the new world number two.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zverev, 27, now boasts seven ATP 1000-level titles over the course of his career, following two wins in Rome and Madrid, as well as victories in Montreal and Cincinnati.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a happy return to Paris for Zverev, after he lost the French Open final in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in June. Four years ago he lost the 2020 Paris Masters championship match to Daniil Medvedev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I knew I had to play like this to win today," said Zverev, who opened his victory speech by apologising to the crowd at Paris' Bercy Arena.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to congratulate Ugo on an incredible week, he's an incredible player,": he added. "If you continue like this, you'll be able to lift trophies like this. This is not your last chance, Ugo."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zverev's victory in Saturday's semi-final meant the current world number three will overtake Spain's Alcaraz in the new updated rankings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The German will next play the ATP Finals in Turin from November 10-17, where he will seek to emulate his past successes in 2018 and 2021 at the season-ending showpiece.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zverev will head into the event as the player with the most wins this year as Sunday's victory in the French capital was his 66th in 2024, taking him one ahead of world number one Jannik Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For 26-year-old Humbert it was a chastening experience at the end of a week that will live long in his memory as he reached his career-first Masters final on home soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world number 18 stunned four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz in the last 16 as he delighted the vocal home crowds on his way to becoming the first French finalist at the indoor event in 13 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to congratulate Zverev for the quality of the tennis he has played all this week, and season," said Humbert.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Moldova’s Western-friendly President Maia Sandu won a second term in a presidential runoff against her opponent who was seen as preferring closer ties with Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a race which was overshadowed by accusations of Russian interference, voter fraud, and intimidation in the European Union candidate country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With nearly 99 percent of votes counted in the second round of the presidential election held on Sunday, Sandu had 55 percent of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Commission, or CEC, compared with 45 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was backed by the pro-Russia Party of Socialists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result will be a major relief to those who backed Sandu’s candidacy and her push for Moldova becoming a member of the EU.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Moldova, you are victorious! Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova!” Sandu said after claiming victory after midnight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She went on to claim that her country's vote had faced an “unprecedented attack" through alleged schemes including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference “by hostile forces from outside the country" and criminal groups.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “You have shown that nothing can stand in the way of the people’s power when they choose to speak through their vote," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that “everyone’s voice deserves respect” and that he hopes “from now on, we will put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was not clear if he had publicly commented on his electoral defeat. (AP)

    Angry crowds throw mud at Spain's king in Valencia

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Furious locals hurled mud and insults at Spain's king, queen and prime minister on Sunday in a startling show of anger in the worst hit town in the flood disaster that has killed more than 210 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More heavy rain fell on the Valencia region after King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were forced to leave Paiporta where more than 70 people died in floods last Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mud hit the monarchs in the face and clothes as they tried to calm the angry crowd in scenes that underscored the fury over the response to the disaster that has now killed at least 217 people with many more still missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The king and queen went to a crisis centre in Paiporta. But extra security guards soon had to keep the angry crowd away from the royals and prime minister. They put up umbrellas to stop mud hitting the royal couple.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The king said later that Spain had to "understand the anger and frustration" of people affected by the devastation to towns where cars have been left in muddy heaps in streets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a social media video, the king called on the public to give the victims "hope and their guarantee that the state in its entirety is present".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the fury seemed directed at Prime Minister Sanchez and Valencia regional government head Carlos Mazon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I understand the social anger and of course, I'm here to receive it. This is my political and moral obligation," Mazon said in a post on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rear window of Sanchez's car was broken before he and the local politicians quickly left. The socialist leader said that while he empathised with the "anguish and suffering" of the victims, he condemned "all forms of violence".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emergency services on Sunday listed 213 dead in the Valencia region, one in Andalusia in the south and three in Castilla-La Mancha neighbouring Valencia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have warned the toll could rise as vehicles trapped in tunnels and underground car parks are cleared. (AFP)

    Shenzhou-18 crew returns to Earth

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-18 manned mission returned to Earth early on Monday after more than six months aboard the Tiangong space station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu are "in good physical condition," after touching down in the return capsule of their Shenzhou spaceship at the Dongfeng landing site in Inner Mongolia, according to Xinhua News Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After leaving the capsule, the trio thanked the country and the people, saying they hope to continue contributing to the country's space programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The China Manned Space Agency described the mission as "a complete success".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ye, the Shenzhou-18 mission commander, has become the first Chinese astronaut with an accumulative spaceflight time of more than a year, setting a new record for the longest duration of stay in orbit by a Chinese astronaut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Chinese astronauts have flown to space in successive missions. I believe that the record of the duration in orbit will be broken in the near future," Ye said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li Cong, who has just completed his first-ever space adventure, said that the crew was united as one and worked closely with the ground team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li Guangsu also returned from his first spaceflight. "We have all enjoyed the unique experience of weightlessness. It is exciting to return to Earth, but we are also unwilling to part the wonders of the space," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trio later arrived in Beijing by plane. They will enter a period of medical quarantine and undergo comprehensive medical examinations and health evaluations, and meet with the press afterwards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The three men had travelled to Tiangong in late April and were met on October 30 by three new astronauts, with whom they conducted a five-day handover before making their return journey.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing earlier said it is on track to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030, where it intends to construct a base on the lunar surface. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A top Slovak mountaineer died on a descent of the 7,234-metre Langtang Lirung peak in Nepal after an historic ascent up its east face, Slovakia's climbers association said on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ondrej Huserka, a member of the Slovak national mountaineering team who had climbed in the Alps, Patagonia, Pamir Mountains and Himalayas, fell into a crevasse on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His Czech climbing partner Marek Holecek said that the pair had just completed the first-ever ascent of the Langtang Lirung peak via the east face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Slovak climbers association SHS James called for rescue action on Facebook but then said on Sunday that the helicopter could not take off because of bad weather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Holecek confirmed the death in an emotional post on Facebook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said Huserka had "hit an angled surface after an eight-metre drop, then continued down a labyrinth into the depths of the glacier".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Holecek added that he had spent hours trying to rescue Huserka but failed as the Slovak was trapped head down and apparently paralysed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I rappelled down to him and stayed with him for four hours until his light faded. There's nothing more to add," Holecek said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   SHS James said that the weather in Nepal would prevent rescue action in the days to come.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Following a phone call with Marek Holecek and his status published yesterday, and given the weather conditions under Langtang Lirung, the family and friends will have to cope with the fact that Ondrej is not with us any more," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Slovak daily SME described the 34-year-old Huserka as "one of the best Slovak mountaineers" who focused on rock and ice climbing. (AFP)

    Orban says Trump win would force Ukraine rethink

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Europe will need to rethink its support of Ukraine if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Sunday, as the continent "will not be able to bear the burdens of the war alone".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Orban opposes military aid to Ukraine and has made clear he thinks Trump shares his views and would negotiate a peace settlement for Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He backs former president Trump, the Republican candidate, to beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in Tuesday's US election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We (in Europe) need to realise that if there will be a pro-peace president in America, which I not only believe in but I also read the numbers that way... if what we expect happens and America becomes pro-peace, then Europe cannot remain pro-war," Orban said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukraine will be high on the agenda when European leaders meet in Budapest in the coming week, he said, referring to a European Political Community meeting and a more informal meeting of EU leaders due to take place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Europe cannot bear the burden of [the war] alone, and if Americans switch to peace, then we also need to adapt, and this is what we will discuss in Budapest," Orban said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Europe is jittery about how the outcome of the US election will affect the war in Ukraine and the continent's security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Orban has angered Brussels with his close ties to Russia and opposition to aid for Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said in July that the Hungarian government sees Trump as a "chance for peace" in Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In July, Orban said his team was assisting Trump's aides with policies on families and migration. On Thursday, he called Trump to wish him good luck ahead of Tuesday's election. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russia on Sunday claimed to have captured another Ukrainian village, just a dozen kilometres from the key eastern logistics hub Pokrovsk, as its troops advance rapidly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Russian defence ministry said it had "liberated the settlement of Vichneve following offensive operations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russia has been making swift advances in the eastern Donetsk region for weeks, taking dozens of towns and villages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, Moscow said its forces had captured the large village of Kurakhivka close to the industrial town of Kurakhove, which Russia is also aiming to capture, and the small village of Pershotravneve in the Kharkiv region close to the eastern Lugansk region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Capturing Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukraine that connects several fortresses in the Donbas, is one of Russia's main objectives in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is also home to a major coke coal mine that is crucial to Ukraine's steel production for its military.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian troops have advanced to just a few kilometres outside the town.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Russian army took 478 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory in October, according to an AFP analysis of data from the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That marks a record since the first weeks of the conflict in March 2022. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Urgent repair work is taking place on a pipe that provides fresh water to Tung Chung, after water supplies were suspended to the area at 10pm on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Water Supplies Department says water supply to the area will gradually resume on Monday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the department said the repairs were needed to a 1,200-millimetre-diameter fresh-water pipe following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A department document said the works is a key facility to supply water to Tung Chung, Hong Kong International Airport, Tai Ho and Discovery Bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials have cordoned off part of Cheung Tung Road to make the repairs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department said it has ordered water trucks and water tanks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that it has contacted the Tung Chung district councillor and care team to offer support to people affected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One Tung Chung resident surnamed Cheung was heading to the market to buy water. He said he had to rush back home to take a shower before the suspension.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The water suspension is annoying. I will go to bed earlier. I need to work tomorrow. I have asked my younger sister to boil some water so we have water to drink," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hospital Authority has said the operation of North Lantau Hospital in Tung Chung will not be affected.

   Russia's Diana Shnaider won her fourth WTA title of a breakout season on Sunday as she blew away Katie Boulter in straight sets at the Hong Kong Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top seed dismantled Britain's second-seeded Boulter 6-1, 6-2 in a one-sided final at Victoria Park lasting 71 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 20-year-old Shnaider, who is ranked 14th in the world, added the Hong Kong crown to titles in Budapest, Bad Homburg in Germany and Hua Hin, Thailand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This year I did an amazing job," she said, admitting that she will have a target on her back from now on after such a successful 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Next year everyone will be getting ready, knowing my game."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She added: "Even if there are a lot of losses, I'll be as positive as possible, just keep building my game, my mentality, my physical strength.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are a lot of things I can improve and achieve to be, say, a top-10 player. It's not a rush, I'll have to be patient."
   <br/>

   Separately, Switzerland's Viktorija Golubic defeated Rebecca Sramkova of Slovakia to clinch the Jiangxi Open in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 32-year-old Golubic won the final 6-3, 7-5 for her first title since 2016. (AFP)

   The Israeli military called for the evacuation of the Baalbek area in eastern Lebanon, warning that it was poised to strike Hezbollah targets there and in nearby Douris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You are currently located near the facilities and assets associated with Hezbollah, which the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) will be targeting in the near future," the Israeli military's Arabic-language spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post on X addressed to residents of Baalbek and Douris.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two people on Sunday were hospitalised, and nine others were injured following accidents at the Sha Tin Cycling Festival, with riders reporting that the path was uneven.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 700 people took part in the inaugural event with 11 races held along the Shing Mun River.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The accidents took place in the youth and elite group competitions, involving nine male and two female riders. Most suffered minor injuries, while two needed hospital treatment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In one of the accidents, a cyclist lost control and crashed into a first aid station, causing other bikers to fall as well, while video footage showed a cyclist in a neck brace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   KT Ng from race organisers Hong Kong Flash Exchange Association said there was not enough time to tidy up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are cars that usually drive on this path on a daily basis. I could see some uneven areas on the road before the race. I contacted the Highways Department during the week to pave the road," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The road was closed at four in the morning and races started at 6.30am. There wasn't enough time, so some things might have been overlooked during the clean-up."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Retired cyclist and event ambassador, Wong Kam-po, said the roads met specifications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It will be better with more experience, because most of the accidents were caused by collisions. Some cyclists might not have good control when it comes to maintaining their position," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They also might not have sufficient experience or it could be nerves."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong added that he hopes to see more competitions take place in Hong Kong.

    Labour chief: top talent scheme vital for HK

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Welfare and Labour Chris Sun on Sunday said it is vital for Hong Kong to attract well-qualified talents from outside its borders, in view of a shortage of local graduates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK programme, the minister noted there are currently about 50,000 local graduates each year, much lower than when he graduated decades ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said that the combination of lower graduate numbers and there being many more career paths than before has left Hong Kong short on talent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He noted that the Top Talent Pass Scheme – where applicants are not required to have a job offer before applying for a visa – shows that the government is being more flexible in importing skilled workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Over the years, Hong Kong has been attractive to talent, but the actual number of people coming here is quite low because our vetting process has been pretty strict. However, as the economy tries to return to normal after the pandemic and with fewer young people around, we really need more highly qualified talent. So, what can we do? That’s when I thought of asking for specific qualification requirements, leading to the Top Talent Pass Scheme,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Currently, there’s no annual quota, with tens of thousands of people arriving in the city through the scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister added he is not concerned that bringing in too many people might potentially harm the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe Hong Kong is an expensive place to live, and it’s tough to make a living. If someone can thrive here, they’re definitely talented. If they can’t make it, they’ll simply leave. It’s a natural process of elimination. While talent chooses Hong Kong, we also choose them,” Sun said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The health chief Lo Chung-mau on Sunday said the government is working on its review of the SAR's healthcare system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo's comments came after the Chief Executive said the government will reform the functions and divisions of work at the Hospital Authority, Department of Health and the newly-established Primary Healthcare Commission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a TVB programme, Lo explained how the healthcare system could be rearranged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, chest and dermatological services have been provided by the Department of Health. But we would like to redistribute these services to either the Hospital Authority or the Primary Healthcare Commission," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Department of Health, meanwhile, will focus on disease prevention and control, health promotion and take on a monitoring role."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief also urged those with chronic or episodic illnesses, such as the flu, not to immediately seek help from the Hospital Authority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo said they should first consult their family doctor, and offered assurances that the government would still take care of the underprivileged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For those who cannot afford this, such as people on low incomes and who are receiving the comprehensive social security assistance, the government will be responsible for them. We will take care of them at the general out-patient clinics."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said that Hong Kong's deepening cooperation with the Middle East can go beyond finance, innovation and technology, and investment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing in his blog, Chan said the SAR can also promote more people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual learning between China and the Middle East.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "During meetings and exchanges, many Middle Eastern investment institutions said that Hong Kong is international, diverse, and can respect different cultural values, allowing both parties to deepen cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit," he wrote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To them, Hong Kong's role as a 'super connector' not only connects the mainland with European, American and Middle Eastern markets, but can also be extended to connecting emerging markets with different backgrounds and cultures."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also said his visit to Riyadh the past week was fruitful and that a series of projects were being facilitated as a result, proving that “Brand Hong Kong” not only has unique value, but also great development potential.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also said he is in talks with the Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative to host its second summit in the SAR next year.

   Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Sunday said she hopes to promote the SAR as a talent hub at the upcoming National People’s Congress Standing Committee meeting in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the top legislative body will at the meeting review several bills and reports, including on developing world-class universities on the mainland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She expressed the hope that these institutions will boost cooperation with universities in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I want to hear about what policies there will be in terms of the cooperation between the mainland’s ‘double first-class universities’ and Hong Kong’s universities. These are important for building Hong Kong into an international hub for top talents,” Lee told reporters at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five-day NPC session will be held from Monday to Friday.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Disneyland on Sunday wrapped up its weekend running event, with a record number of people attending.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly 20,000 people – including children and those with visual, hearing and physical disabilities – signed up for the event, a record for the Hong Kong Disneyland 10K Weekend 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan, one of the guests of honour, said it was the first time runners could jog through World of Frozen, the world’s first and largest attraction themed on the popular Disney franchise. Chan said this shows that the SAR is full of attractions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This event shows that as long as we use our brains to think of new ideas we can draw more people to Hong Kong because there are so many attractive places here,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There are so many people from the mainland and other places in the world. We welcome you.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One runner, dressed as Queen Anna from Frozen, travelled with her family from Thailand. She said she visits the SAR a lot and loves the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong, first of all, is close and another thing is like we enjoy local food very much. We like to taste food and all the culture and this trip I plan to take them on the tram to see all the scenery of Hong Kong," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I love it very much. The mountain, the ocean and the city is all so good."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another participant, who is visually impaired, said he completed his first 10-kilometre race in about 70 minutes and that racing through the theme park was a whole new experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The race in Disneyland is so different from other races. They play music in these races, while most races don't," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think music is a form of motivation, and Disney music sounds really good. When they play it while you are running, it is like an adrenaline rush."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police have arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and robbery, after an off-duty sergeant was attacked and had his wallet snatched in Jordan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident happened in the small hours of Saturday on Nathan Road near Wing On Plus department store.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Senior Inspector So Man-ho said the victim got into a scuffle with the suspect after realising his wallet had been stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The victim identified himself as a police officer, but the man attacked his neck and limbs multiple times with a sharp object. The victim tried several times to stop the assault but failed," So said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Another passerby attempted to intervene, and filmed the incident with his phone. The attacker fled empty-handed,” he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sergeant was treated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and was discharged on the same day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers on Saturday arrested the attacker, who is a foreign man on a temporary entry permit, at his home in Hung Hom.

   Hong Kong's swimming queen Siobhan Haughey has capped off her medal-studded World Aquatics Swimming World Cup 2024 performance by winning silver in the 100-metre freestyle event in Singapore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haughey on Saturday finished the 100-metre race in 51.56 seconds, just under a second behind American Kate Douglass' 50.82-second performance. Poland's Katarzyna Wasick rounded off the podium with a time of 52.04 seconds.

   <br/>
   On Friday in Singapore, she was crowned the 200-metre freestyle queen after a clean sweep in the event. On the same day, she appeared poolside in an inflatable panda costume and waved to cheering crowds.
   <br/>

  <img alt="Officials say drug-related crime in Poitiers has soared. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777343_1_20241102215300.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 15-year-old boy shot in the head during a bloody shootout between drug gangs in the west of France on Saturday died of his wounds, the regional prosecutor announced, as the interior minister warned the country was at risk of "Mexicanisation" due to rising drug crime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The teen had been in intensive care since the shootings Thursday evening in the city of Poitiers, which have raised alarm nationwide over increasing violence in gangland turf wars that are making the streets unsafe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other minors, aged between 15 and 16, were also injured by gunshots fired in front of a restaurant in the city in the incident which involved dozens of people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers used tear gas to break up the fight, restoring order around 45 minutes after arriving on the scene, the source added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Friday that France's struggle with drug-related violence is at a "tipping point," with the nation facing a choice between "full mobilisation or the 'Mexicanisation' of the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mexico has suffered more than 450,000 drug-related killings since the government started using the military to fight its notorious drug cartels in 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gangland violence long associated with the Mediterranean port city Marseille has expanded into other French cities in recent years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victims can include gang members, some of them minors guarding dealing spots or employed as hitmen, but also innocent bystanders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Poitiers' experience on Thursday was "unprecedented" for the city of 90,000, mayor Leonore Moncond'huy said, adding that it "demonstrated rather serious developments in society."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Retailleau, a member of the right-wing Republicans and seen as a hardliner on security issues, has called for the battle against drug violence to become a "nationwide effort" since becoming interior minister in Prime Minister Michel Barnier's shaky minority government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The 'narco thugs' have no limits any more... These shootouts aren't happening in South America, they're happening in Rennes, in Poitiers... we're at a tipping point," Retailleau told BFMTV. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City suffered their first Premier League loss since December as Bournemouth stunned the champions, while Arsenal were rocked by Newcastle and Liverpool seized top spot on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City were unbeaten in their previous 32 league games, dating back to a defeat at Aston Villa last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Pep Guardiola's second-placed side saw that streak come to an unexpected end in a 2-1 loss on England's south coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Cherries had never beaten City in their 21 previous meetings, losing 19 of those matches, yet Andoni Iraola's team sprang a huge upset to derail the champions' push for a fifth successive title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bournemouth recently damaged Arsenal's title hopes with a 2-0 win at the Vitality Stadium and they inflicted pain on City as well.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Guardiola had claimed City faced an injury "emergency" after they suffered fitness problems in Wednesday's League Cup defeat at Tottenham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Exhausted or not, City were rocked in the ninth minute when Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo drilled Milos Kerkez's cross past Ederson from inside the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Guardiola's men were unable to muster a response to that blow and Evanilson doubled Bournemouth's lead in the 64th minute with a composed finish from Kerkez's cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Josko Gvardiol's header reduced the deficit in the 82nd minute, but it was too late to save City from a second defeat in four days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have a lot of players with no minutes so the balance is a bit uncomfortable. Today we could not handle their intensity. That's why we lost the game," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Newcastle put a huge dent in fourth-placed Arsenal's title aspirations with a 1-0 win at St James' Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alexander Isak netted in the 12th minute, heading home Anthony Gordon's pinpoint cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Injury-hit Arsenal struggled to get out of first gear and produced just one shot on target in the entire game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mikel Arteta's team, runners-up to City for the past two years, have taken just one point from their last three games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Today we weren't our best version. It's about how you react to that. We're not going to find the right words or answers to describe how we feel," said Arteta, whose side are seven points adrift of first place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At Anfield, Liverpool were in danger of a surprise loss of their own before regrouping to take advantage of their rivals' stumbles with a 2-1 win over Brighton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ferdi Kadioglu gave Brighton the lead in the 14th minute with a fierce strike that cannoned in off the post after Danny Welbeck flicked on Kaoru Mitoma's cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Liverpool had beaten Brighton in the League Cup last 16 in midweek and they repeated the trick thanks to a late revival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cody Gakpo bagged the equaliser in the 69th minute with a cross that looped straight into the net.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three minutes later, Mohamed Salah put Liverpool ahead, the Egypt forward curling a fine finish into the top corner for his ninth goal this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Arne Slot's first season in charge, Liverpool are two points clear of City after their eighth win in 10 league games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "More than the position we are in, if you face a team like this and are 1-0 down and can come back to a 2-1 win that gives me a lot of confidence," Slot said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nottingham Forest are up to third place after beating 10-man West Ham 3-0 to make it three consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since 1999.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chris Wood grabbed his eighth goal in 10 league games in the 27th minute and West Ham had Edson Alvarez sent off in first-half stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Callum Hudson-Odoi struck in the 65th minute and Ola Aina sealed the points 12 minutes from full-time at the City Ground.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jordan Ayew's stoppage-time equaliser denied third-bottom Ipswich their first top-flight win since 2002 as Leicester rescued a 1-1 draw at Portman Road.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leif Davis' 55th-minute volley put Ipswich ahead but the hosts had Kalvin Phillips sent off in the 77th minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Second-bottom Southampton earned their first league win this season as Adam Armstrong's 85th minute strike sealed a 1-0 success against Everton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Winless Wolves remain bottom of the table after Marc Guehi's 77th minute equaliser earned Crystal Palace a 2-2 draw at Molineux. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Air pollution in Pakistan's second biggest city Lahore soared on Saturday, around 40 times over the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation (WHO), data from IQAir showed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The level of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – peaked at 610, with a reading above 15 in a 24-hour period considered unhealthy by the WHO.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The air quality index, which measures a range of pollutants, also spiked at 1,067.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have never reached a level of 1,000," said Jahangir Anwar, a senior environmental protection official in Lahore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For days, Lahore has been enveloped by smog, a mix of fog and pollutants caused by low-grade diesel fumes, smoke from seasonal agricultural burning and winter cooling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Wednesday, the provincial environmental protection agency announced new restrictions in four "hot spots" in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuk-tuks equipped with polluting two-stroke engines are banned, as are restaurants that barbecue without filters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government offices and private companies will have half their staff work from home starting on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Construction work has been halted and street and food vendors, who often cook over open fires, must close at 8 pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Smog is particularly pronounced in winter when cold, denser air traps emissions from poor-quality fuels used to power the city's vehicles and factories at ground level. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 5.48-metre Australian crocodile that held the world record as the largest crocodile in captivity has died, a wildlife sanctuary said on Saturday. He was thought to be more than 110 years old.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cassius, weighing in at more than one ton, had been in declining health since October 15, Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat said on Facebook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild Croc," according to a post by the organisation, based on Green Island near the Queensland tourist town of Cairns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Cassius will be deeply missed, but our love and memories of him will remain in our hearts forever."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group's website said he had lived at the sanctuary since 1987 after being transported from the neighbouring Northern Territory, where crocodiles are a key part of the region's tourist industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cassius, a saltwater crocodile, held the Guinness World Records title as the world's largest crocodile in captivity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He took the title after the 2013 death of Philippines crocodile Lolong, who measured 6.17 metres long, according to Guinness. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   "Anti-woke" candidate Kemi Badenoch on Saturday won the vote to become the UK Conservatives' new leader, replacing Rishi Sunak who quit after the party's disastrous showing in July's general election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Badenoch, 44, came out on top in the two-horse race with former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, winning 57 percent of the votes of party members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said that becoming party leader was an "enormous honour," but that "the task that stands before us is tough."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be honest about the fact we made mistakes" and "let standards slip," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is time to get down to business, it is time to renew," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The combative former equalities minister now faces the daunting task of reuniting a divided and weakened party that was emphatically ousted from power in July after 14 years in charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Badenoch will become the official leader of the opposition and face off against Labour's Keir Starmer in the House of Commons every Wednesday for the traditional Prime Minister's Questions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, she will be leading a much-reduced cohort of Tory MPs in the chamber following the party's dismal election showing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She must plot a strategy to regain public trust while stemming the flow of support to the right-wing Reform UK party, led by Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Having campaigned on a right-wing platform, she also faces the prospect of future difficulties within the ranks of Tory lawmakers, which includes many centrists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Badenoch, born in London to Nigerian parents and raised in Lagos, has called for a return to conservative values, accusing her party of having become increasingly liberal on societal issues such as gender identity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She describes herself as a straight-talker, a trait that has caused controversy on the campaign trail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When addressing immigration, Badenoch said that "not all cultures are equally valid" when deciding who should be allowed to live in the UK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was widely criticised after suggesting that statutory maternity pay on small businesses was "excessive" and sparked further furore when she joked that up to 10 percent of Britain's half a million civil servants were so bad that they "should be in prison." (AFP)

  <img alt="Spaniard Jorge Martin and his team celebrate after he won Saturday's sprint race in Malaysia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777334_1_20241102191043.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Jorge Martin took a major step towards his first MotoGP world title as he won the sprint race in Malaysia on Saturday and rival Francesco Bagnaia crashed out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain's Martin extended his championship lead to 29 points from 17, with just the grand prix on Sunday at Sepang and one more race weekend to go.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a bitter blow for Italian two-time reigning champion Bagnaia, who started on pole but came off his Ducati early on to gift a big advantage to Martin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pramac Ducati's Martin romped home nearly a second ahead of six-time world champion Marc Marquez and can seal the title on Sunday if he earns nine more points than Bagnaia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think last year I wasn't ready to win," said the 26-year-old Martin, who came second in the title race behind his rival last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This season I am more mature. It is a privilege to be here at this point with this advantage, but nothing is over till it's over."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Light rain fell at a sweltering Sepang five minutes before the start of the 10-lap sprint, adding to the tension on the grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia started on pole with Martin alongside him on the front row, only for the Spaniard to seize the lead at the first corner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With eight laps to go and pushing hard, Bagnaia lost control of his Ducati at turn nine and slid out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was unhurt but had his head in his hands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I entered the corner a bit slower but I touched the back on the apex of the corner and I lost the front," said the 27-year-old.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's something that can happen, but all the risk I was taking to fight back with Jorge wasn't over the limit."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia dominated Friday's practice and clocked a track record to grab pole for the sprint and the grand prix on Sunday, when 25 points are up for grabs for the winner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think Pecco will risk a lot tomorrow to win," Martin said of the Italian.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So to beat him in these conditions is really tough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He has nothing to lose now. It's all or nothing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The season finale had been scheduled for Valencia in a fortnight but it was cancelled on Friday after deadly flooding in that part of Spain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers are rushing to find a replacement venue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A minute's silence was held in Sepang before the sprint race to remember the more than 200 dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Right now all my prayers are for Valencia and people at home," said Martin. (AFP)

    Spain sends thousands more troops to flood-hit region

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain will deploy 10,000 more troops and police officers to the eastern Valencia region devastated by historic floods that have killed 211 people, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hopes of finding survivors more than three days after torrents of muddy water submerged towns and wrecked infrastructure were slim in the European country's deadliest such disaster in decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Almost all the deaths have been recorded in the eastern Valencia region, where thousands of security and emergency services personnel were frantically clearing debris and mud in the search for bodies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sanchez said in a televised address that the disaster was the second deadliest flood in Europe this century and announced a huge increase in the security forces for relief works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government had accepted the Valencia region leader's request for 5,000 more troops and informed him of a further deployment of 5,000 police officers and civil guards, Sanchez said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain was carrying out its largest deployment of army and security force personnel in peacetime, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Restoring order and distributing aid to destroyed towns and villages – some of which have been cut off from food, water and power for days – is a priority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have come under fire over the adequacy of warning systems before the floods, and some stricken residents have complained the response to the disaster is too slow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am aware the response is not enough, there are problems and severe shortages... towns buried by mud, desperate people searching for their relatives," Sanchez said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Susana Camarero, deputy head of the Valencia region, told journalists on Saturday that essential supplies had been delivered "from day one" to all accessible settlements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it was "logical" that affected residents were asking for more, she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities in the Valencia region have restricted access to roads for two days to allow emergency services to carry out search, rescue and logistics operations more effectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials have said dozens of people remain unaccounted for.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But with telephone and transport networks severely damaged, establishing a precise figure is difficult.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska on Friday told Cadena Ser radio station that it was "reasonable" to believe more fatalities would emerge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is also hoped that the estimated number of missing people will fall once telephone and internet services are running again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thousands of ordinary citizens pushing shopping trolleys and carrying cleaning equipment took to the streets on Friday to help with the clean-up effort.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Camarero said some municipalities were "overwhelmed by the amount of solidarity and food" they had received.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The surge in togetherness continued on Saturday as around 1,000 people set off from the Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia towards nearby towns laid waste by the floods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have urged them to stay at home to avoid congestion on the roads that would hamper the work of emergency services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The storm that sparked the floods on Tuesday formed as cold air moved over the warm waters of the Mediterranean and is common for this time of year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But scientists warn that climate change driven by human activity is increasing the ferocity, length and frequency of such extreme weather events. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police have arrested eight men reportedly with a triad background after a prison officer was attacked outside Pik Uk prison in Sai Kung on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the police, three masked men equipped with "long hard objects" attacked the corrections officer when he was waiting for a bus near the prison at about 12:50pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trio, aged 16 to 37, then got in a private car with a fake licence plate and fled the scene.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Superintendent Lam Kai-chor said while they are still investigating a motive for the attack and whether it's related to the victim's job, no evidence showed correlation to the victim's financial situation or personal life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are a total of six cuts that are five to 10 centimetres long on the victim's head and upper limbs, and a fracture on his right wrist. The victim is now stable and remains in hospital for treatment," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Also, during the chaos, the three men hit a 33-year-old woman and her two-year-old daughter. They sustained minor injuries and left the hospital after treatment without any issues."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Macau's Chief Executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has vowed to diversify the SAR's economy, a day after receiving his formal appointment letter from Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said on Saturday that he was deeply honoured for his official appointment as the chief executive for the sixth term of the Macau government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Xi Jinping met Sam, a former Macau top judge, in Beijing on Friday, saying the central government fully endorses and trusts the incoming chief executive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters upon returning to Macau, Sam pledged to accurately and comprehensively implement One Country, Two Systems, safeguard national security, and support growth of its economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Economic diversification is an issue of great concern to President Xi and central authorities. We must continue to create conditions on this front in the future, and steadily promote economic diversification," Sam said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the new government set to be sworn in on December 20, Sam said he aimed to hand in a list of the proposed governing team to Beijing within a month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He won 394 votes from a 400-strong election committee in the CE election on October 13.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed on Saturday to respond to attacks by Israel and its ally the United States against Tehran and groups it supports in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The enemies, both the USA and the Zionist regime, should know that they will definitely receive a tooth-breaking response to what they are doing against Iran, the Iranian nation, and the resistance front," said Khamenei at a student gathering in Tehran, referring to the alliance of Tehran-backed groups that include Yemen's Houthis, Lebanese Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes as Washington announced the deployment of additional military assets to the Middle East, including ballistic missile defense destroyers and long-range B-52 bomber aircraft, serving as a warning to Iran as it and Israel trade tit-for-tat strikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it had launched rockets at an Israeli intelligence base near Tel Aviv in the early hours of Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah and Israel exchanged cross-border fire for nearly a year after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war, before Israel ramped up the conflict on September 23.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group frequently claims to have fired rockets at Israeli bases or urban areas in Israeli territory, and has several times claimed the targeting of Glilot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military said on Saturday that sirens were activated following the arrival of "suspicious aerial targets" from Lebanon and the targets remained under surveillance in an ongoing incident. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nearly 200,000 people in western Japan were urged to evacuate on Saturday as authorities warned of landslides and floods while the remnants of a tropical storm trickle over the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Japan Meteorological Agency said "warm, moist air... was causing heavy rainfall with thunderstorms in western Japan" partly due to Kong-rey, which was downgraded to an extratropical low-pressure system from a typhoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The city of Matsuyama "issued the top-level warning, urging 189,552 residents in its 10 districts to evacuate and immediately secure safety," a city official told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the evacuation was not mandatory, Japan's highest-level warning is typically issued when it is extremely likely that some kind of disaster has already occurred.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters warned that landslides and floods could affect western Japan on Saturday and eastern Japan on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Due to rain, shinkansen bullet trains were briefly suspended between Tokyo and southern Fukuoka region in the morning before resuming on a delayed schedule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kong-rey smashed into Taiwan on Thursday as one of the biggest storms to hit the island in decades. It claimed at least two lives and knocked out power to tens of thousands of households.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say human-driven climate change is intensifying the risk posed by heavy rains because a warmer atmosphere holds more water. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A country park near the border with Shenzhen is key to ecological conservation and revitalisation, according to the Environment minister Tse Chin-wan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Located in Sha Tau Kok, the 530-hectare Robin's Nest Country Park was once a prime mining site.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The area, which was established this year as the 25th country park in Hong Kong, also supports one of the most important bat colonies in the territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department is gradually constructing recreational facilities, such as hiking trail networks and viewing points in Robin's Nest Country Park," Tse said at the park's opening ceremony on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It also expects to complete the revitalisation of the Lin Ma Hang Lead Mine by the end of the year and open it to the public, allowing people to deepen their understanding of Hong Kong's mining history, and bat ecology there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robin's Nest is connected to Shenzhen Wutong Mountain, forming a cross-border ecological corridor between the SAR and neighbouring Shenzhen. The park is rich in biodiversity with many species of high conservation value.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The immigration chief has revealed that he personally reached out to snooker superstar Ronnie O'Sullivan, recommending a suitable visa scheme for the Briton to come to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old, known as "the Rocket" for his fast and attacking playing style, recently became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, saying the territory is a great place to live because of the food, culture and a low tax regime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a televised interview on Saturday, Director of Immigration Benson Kwok revealed he found out from a friend that O'Sullivan had interest to develop his career in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As the director of immigration, of course, I have to recommend some visa schemes that are suitable for him. He quickly chose the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, and his application was approved by the committee on quality migrants and professionals," Kwok said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The result was ideal because O'Sullivan has been helpful, promoting Hong Kong's attractiveness."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun, for his part, said the snooker player's decision to obtain Hong Kong residency was a testament to the city's attractiveness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The fact that O'Sullivan has decided to come to Hong Kong and become a part of us speaks volumes about the attraction of the SAR," Sun said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope to achieve more success, because we truly believe in the attraction of Hong Kong. Be it our tax system, our natural beauty, the convenience, the great food and all the great things here in Hong Kong, it's a huge attraction for top talent all over the world."

  <img alt="Michael Tien says more attractions like Disneyland and Kai Tak Sports Park can generate revenue perpetually for the local economy.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A lawmaker has highlighted the need for Hong Kong to have more large-scale, staple infrastructure in order to deepen and broaden its tourist base.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Michael Tien made the remarks on Saturday on a Commercial Radio Programme, where he pointed out that even though tourism has only contributed less than 10 percent to the local GDP, it's crucial to other sectors, like retail and the food and beverage industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tien emphasised that, rather than relying on mainland visitors, the territory can set up more permanent attractions like Disneyland and Kai Tak to draw more visitors from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kai Tak - the largest sports park in Hong Kong with 50,000 seats - is set to open its doors next March, and will host British rock band Coldplay a month later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Kai Tak so far, and Disneyland are about the only two continuous attractions we have to attract people from overseas to come to Hong Kong to spend, to consume, and we need a few more of this," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've been advocating for a race track with reclamation at Penny's Bay. That could be a third long-term tourist infrastructure...the beauty about Disneyland and Kai Tak is that they're perpetual - they can generate new economic activity, day after day."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Tien, who's also a businessman, called on the government to offer two years of rates concessions to ease the burden on tenants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said many are paying "astronomical rents" for agreements that were signed at a time when tourist traffic was much higher.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are now currently paying rental to support actually a much larger consumer base, dating back to 2017 and 2018, when a lot of mainlanders were coming down to Hong Kong to spend money, so we lost about 30 percent on that consumer base," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Therefore, based on a free market economy, the rents are going to come down. So we need breathing space of about two years to have new tenancy to be in effect. So this is the two-year relief that I am asking the government to help us on."

    Talent scheme screening system 'robust': labour chief

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun has assured there is a strict system to screen people applying to enter Hong Kong under the top talent scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said on Saturday that officials have not found anyone providing fake credentials, following earlier reports of people allegedly forging documents to cheat their way into a local university.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have built in a very, very robust system to make sure that all the qualifications submitted to us are true, and can be verified," Sun told reporters after a radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For submissions, say, from mainland China, it's a mandatory requirement. They have to verify via a third-party system, or they have to verify directly with the institution granting them the qualifications."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The administration had said visa holders under the scheme will be given an extra two months to apply for an extension.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Extension approvals will be granted based on various factors, including the person's income, tax payments and time spent in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The labour minister pointed out that officials do not currently have an estimate on how many individuals would have their visas extended.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The NBA champion Boston Celtics, fueled by 32 points from Jayson Tatum, bounced back from an overtime defeat with a gritty 124-109 victory over the Hornets in Charlotte on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum added 11 points for his third double-double of the season and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points with six rebounds and five assists in a physical game that saw tensions erupt in the fourth quarter when former Celtic Grant Williams sent Tatum sprawling with a shoulder-to-shoulder check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Williams was ejected, but Brown and others were clearly angered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Less than a minute later, LaMelo ball was assessed a flagrant foul for crowding in under Tatum as the Celtics star attempted a three-pointer, and Charlotte's Miles Bridges was ejected in the final minutes for punching the ball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It all could make for fireworks when the teams face off again on Saturday, but Charlotte's loss of composure was costly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Toronto, the Los Angeles Lakers let a 26-point lead dwindle to single digits but held on to snap a two-game losing streak with a 131-125 victory over the Raptors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James set the tone early, scoring 14 of his 27 points in the first quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anthony Davis poured in 38 points and pulled down 12 rebounds in another monster offensive effort. However, he was more concerned that the Lakers, up 76-51 at halftime, let the Raptors back into the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Toronto had cut the deficit to six points early in the fourth quarter and the Lakers' lead was at eight, 106-98, when Rui Hachimura drilled a pair of three-pointers to push Los Angeles' advantage back to 12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That lead was halved with 1:02 remaining before the Lakers closed it out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Unacceptable," Davis said. "We won, and we'll take the win for sure because it's hard to win in this league, especially on the road. (AFP)

    Nvidia to join key US stock index

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chip giant Nvidia will join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Wall Street index announced on Friday, underscoring the importance of artificial intelligence in the US economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The addition of Nvidia, which will take effect on November 8, also marks a historic moment for the semiconductor industry, as the AI chip leader replaces struggling rival Intel, which has been a Dow constituent since 1999.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   S&P Dow Jones Indices, the company that runs the index, also said it would add paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams, replacing chemical giant Dow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180 percent this year as tech giants clamour for its powerful and high cost processors that power generative AI, the technology that is widely seen as the next phase of innovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Intel, one of Silicon Valley's most iconic companies, has seen its shares fall 50 percent so far this year as the company struggles to meet the AI boom.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow in 1896, is often used as a bellwether for the state of the US stock market, the biggest in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unlike the S&P500 that weighs companies by market capitalization, the 30-stock Dow is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more influence on its movements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tech companies Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce and Cisco Systems are currently in the index, while Google, Amazon and Meta are not. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks rebounded on Friday from mixed tech earnings and investor jitters less than a week before a neck-and-neck US presidential election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After major indices tumbled on Thursday following big drops in Microsoft and Meta, buoyant results from Amazon helped boost the market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors also took the bright side of a weak employment report that showed the US economy added just 12,000 jobs last month, far below expectations in a report that was temporarily distorted by major hurricanes and the Boeing strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But on the positive side, the report bolstered the chance that the Fed will reduce interest rates again next week. Futures markets overwhelmingly expect a quarter-point cut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All three major US indices advanced, led by the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.7 percent at 42,052.19, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 5,728.80 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 percent to 18,239.92.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Amazon report "countered some of the negativity that was building yesterday on the mega-cap" stocks, said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts expect cautious trading early next week ahead of the US presidential election on Tuesday, with the result possibly delayed for several days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oil prices gained following reports that Iran was planning a major retaliatory strike on Israel, reviving the market's geopolitical fears.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expectations of a major rate cut by the Fed, like the bumper 50 basis point cut in September, have receded after data showed strong economic growth in the United States and inflation just above the central bank's long-term two percent target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the "lower-than-expected jobs creation could prompt the Fed to follow through with the widely anticipated 25 basis point cut following their next meeting later next week," said Mahmoud Alkudsi, senior market analyst at ADSS brokerage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst with eToro, said the October jobs numbers "should keep a December rate cut on the table, too." (AFP)

  <img alt="South Africa's squad includes 26 of the 35 World Cup winners from last year.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Who starts at fly-half and scrum-half will command most attention when world champions South Africa launch a three-Test tour of Britain on November 10 against Scotland in Edinburgh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Creative Manie Libbok and ace goal-kicker Handre Pollard are the rivals for the playmaker role while Jaden Hendrikse, Cobus Reinach and Grant Williams eye the number 9 shirt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Young fly-half Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, the find of the season for the Springboks, misses out as he recovers from a knee operation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Calm under intense pressure, Pollard has started four of 10 Tests this year and boasts a near 80 percent goal-kicking record.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Libbok was a starter just twice, and an erratic goal kicker with a 58 percent success rate. He has been hailed, however, for his handling, running and ability to create scoring chances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two-time World Cup-winning scrum-half Faf de Klerk was available after a lengthy absence due to a thigh injury, but did not make the squad, possibly because he last played in mid July.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Africa, who beat Italy and England and lost to France and Ireland on their last end-of-season tour two years ago, are seeking a first sweep since 2013.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If head coach Rassie Erasmus opts to kick off the tour – which also includes internationals against England and Wales – with his strongest side most of the other 13 selections appear clearcut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Damian Willemse ruled out by a groin injury, Aphelele Fassi should continue at full-back after a superb return to form this year following two seasons in the Test wilderness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wings Cheslin Kolbe and Kurt-Lee Arendse and centres Jesse Kriel and Damian de Allende have been first choices throughout a season in which South Africa have won eight of 10 Tests.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Erasmus has three hookers to choose from with Bongi Mbonambi and often outstanding impact player Malcolm Marx favoured to make the matchday 23.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Loosehead Ox Nche and tighthead Vincent Koch – in the absence of injured Frans Malherbe – are the likely props.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is stiff competition to join Eben Etzebeth in the second row. Leinster lock RG Snyman is used to British conditions and this may give him the edge over Franco Mostert and Ruan Nortje.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pieter-Steph du Toit, considered by many Springbok supporters as the best rugby player in the world this year, and captain Siya Kolisi are the first-choice flankers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Loose forward Duane Vermeulen retired after South Africa edged arch rivals New Zealand 12-11 in Paris last October to win back-to-back World Cup finals, and a record fourth title overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That opened the door for Jasper Wiese to inherit the number 8 shirt, although Cameron Hanekom, who can operate in all three back-row positions, is a rising star and potential challenger.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hanekom, fly-half Jordan Hendrikse, hooker Johan Grobbelaar and tighthead Wilco Louw were late additions in place of injured trio Willemse, prop-hooker Jan-Hendrik Wessels and Malherbe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The squad includes 26 of the 35 World Cup winners from last year and 10 of the starting line-up against the All Blacks in the title decider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is a healthy mix of youth and experience with most of the players having made strong statements in the Springbok jersey this season," says Erasmus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Having played key coaching roles in the 2019 and 2023 World Cup triumphs, Erasmus faces fresh challenges ahead of the next global showpiece, which Australia will host in 2027.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the triumphant squad of last year will be closer to 40 than 30 by the next World Cup, and Erasmus admits age is a factor as he plots the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot look too far ahead and forget the present. But we also cannot get stuck in the present. There are guys in the squad who were not there before the last World Cup," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Erasmus says his aim before 2027 is to develop a squad in which "ideally there are three excellent players competing for every position." (AFP)

    'Brat' named word of the year by Collins dictionary

  <img alt="Thanks to singer Charli XCX the word 'brat' now means a lot more than simply a badly-behaved child. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777242_1_20241101192506.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Brat, the word redefined by singer Charli XCX and adopted by supporters of US presidential candidate Kamala Harris, was on Friday named the Collins Word of the Year 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Brat" was the name of the UK singer's hit sixth album, and the word has now come to represent a "confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude," said Collins, rather than simply a term for a badly-behaved child.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Inspired by the Charli XCX album, 'brat' has become one of the most talked about words of 2024," said the UK-based dictionary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "More than a hugely successful album, 'brat' is a cultural phenomenon that has resonated with people globally, and 'brat summer' established itself as an aesthetic and a way of life," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 32-year-old pop star, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, described the typical brat girl as someone "who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes, who feels herself, but then also maybe has a breakdown, but kind of parties through it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She tweeted in July that "Kamala IS brat," in reference to the US Vice President, prompting the presidential nominee to use her song "365" in one of her TikTok videos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Her campaign account also re-branded with a lime green photo in the style of the Brat album cover.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The album hit number one in her native UK and number three in the US. (AFP)
