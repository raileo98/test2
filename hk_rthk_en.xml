 Two women died in a knife attack on Thursday at a shopping center in the Czech Republic, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they detained a teenage suspect in connection with the stabbings in a store in the city of Hradec Kralove, some 100 kilometres east of Prague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports initially said the victims had been injured, one of them seriously, but police later said both had died.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were not identified.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 16-year-old Czech national was detained by police about one kilometer from the scene, shortly after the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  A knife was found nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Petr Fiala offered his condolences to the relatives of the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What has happened in Hradec Kralove today is an absolutely incomprehensible and horrible act,” he posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the situation was under control and there was no danger to the public. (AP)

    'Wrong vaccines did not harm two affected kids'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health has apologised for mistakenly giving pneumococcal vaccines to two children who were supposed to get hepatitis B vaccinations at the Tin Shui Wai Maternal and Child Health Centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said there was no adverse reaction in the affected kids and paediatricians have assessed that the wrong vaccines do not pose any health risks to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven children, between one and seven months old, were scheduled to receive hepatitis B vaccines between 4pm and 5.30pm on Monday, the department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a routine check of vaccination records later that day found that two fewer doses of hepatitis B vaccine had been used and two extra doses of pneumococcal vaccine had been used.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said while investigations are ongoing it is believed the incident was due to human error, noting it had instructed the health centre to step up efforts in the training of frontline staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the nursing staff involved had been suspended from vaccination duties and disciplinary action would be taken if the probe confirms any misconduct.

    Ousted S Korean leader goes on trial

<img alt="Ousted premier Han Duck-soo told Seoul's Constitutional Court he had " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792501_1_20250220184003.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted premier said on Thursday that he had opposed suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law, testifying for the first time at his former boss' impeachment trial about the events of a night that threw the country into turmoil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han Duck-soo was impeached by parliament as acting President and Prime Minister in December over alleged obstruction of the trial that would formally remove Yoon from office for his martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, he appeared before that trial for the first time, telling Seoul's Constitutional Court he had "expressed my opposition" to Yoon's decision to suspend civilian rule on the night of December 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said he and most of his fellow cabinet members "believed such a declaration would put South Korea in serious difficulty", and that he recalled them "being concerned and trying to dissuade it".
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's hearing was Yoon's 10th before Seoul's Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the hearings wrap up, the judges will go behind closed doors to deliberate Yoon's fate — with elections required in 60 days if he is removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon walked out of the court just five minutes after proceedings began on Thursday, according to a pool report.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Yoon Kap-keun told reporters that the ousted president felt it was "inappropriate" for him to sit in the same court room with Han "or for the president to watch the prime minister testify".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not good for the nation's prestige," his lawyer quoted Yoon as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon later returned to hear the testimony of former senior intelligence official Hong Jang-won, seen as a key figure in the decision to declare martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong has claimed to be in possession of a memo containing a list of names of individuals Yoon ordered arrested during the night of the martial law declaration, including the leaders of the opposition and Yoon's own ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best to recount everything as I remember it," Hong told reporters before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of South Korea's National Police Agency, who is also on trial on insurrection charges related to the martial law decree, is another witness. (AFP)

    Remand, new prison admission numbers rise in 2024

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The average daily number of people in remand reached its highest in more than two decades while the number of new admissions to correctional institutions last year also rose, prison authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  New prison admissions overall stood at 18,438 last year, up seven percent from the figure in 2023, according to the Correctional Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,600 people were remanded in custody on average per day over the past year – the highest figure since 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to the ever-changing penal population, especially the increasing population of those in remand, the department has deployed part of the capacity of certain correctional institutions to admit those in remand, to alleviate the overcrowding situation of reception centres," said commissioner Wong Kwok-hing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delivering an annual round-up of the department's work, Wong also said authorities decided against introducing legal amendments to prevent people placed under supervision from leaving Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea was previously floated after former student activist Tony Chung allegedly violated his supervision order and went to Britain to seek political asylum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After discussing with the Department of Justice, we found that under current laws, we actually have enough power to impose some new supervisory conditions," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So since last year, we have implemented some arrangements for all those under supervision on applying to leave Hong Kong. They must apply to our supervisors before leaving Hong Kong, and they can only leave when we give approval."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifteen cases had been approved so far under the new rule, Wong added.

    Slight uptick in HK bad loans seen in 2024: BEA

<img alt="The Bank of East Asia delivered a 12 percent increase in its net profits in 2024, to HK$4.6 billion. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792489_1_20250220180623.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of East Asia (BEA) on Thursday said it has been closely monitoring risks related to its exposure to the Hong Kong property sector as there was a slight uptick in so-called "bad loans" last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference reviewing the bank's annual financial results, co-chief executive Adrian Li said about 6 percent of BEA's HK$61.4 billion Hong Kong property loans were non-performing in 2024, up from about 3 percent the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of these loans were in the commercial real estate sector, he said, adding that credit ratings for some of the bank's local clients were downgraded which in turn prompted the bank to significantly increase provision for its local property loans to over HK$1.2 billion, up from HK$380 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proportion of local property loans to the group's total loans, meanwhile, dropped to 11.5 percent at the end of last year, from 13.7 percent at the end of 2023, as the bank gradually reduced its exposure to Hong Kong property due to "relatively high risks" on the commercial side.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Li struck a more optimistic tone when it comes to the mainland, saying the risk of bad loans there is stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unwinding of the interest rate cycle should ease pressure on the Chinese real estate sector in the medium term, provided that rates continue their downward trajectory. With the impact of stimulus packages beginning to manifest, confidence is gradually returning improving investors, sentiment and activities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li's remarks came as the bank delivered a 12 percent increase in its overall net profits in the past financial year, rising to HK$4.6 billion from the HK$4.2 billion in 2023 on the back of US interest rate reductions as well as stimulus measures from Beijing and the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.38 per share, more than double that of the year before, bringing the total annual dividend to HK$0.69 per share, up over 27 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Brian Li, the bank's co-chief executive, said the lender has seen a significant increase in demand from mainland customers for wealth management services in the SAR, with the number of mainland clients jumping 60 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That, he said, helped boost revenue from relevant investment products by 28 percent year-on-year.

    8,500 tickets on offer for Kai Tak Sports Park opening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Thursday that 8,500 tickets would be up for grabs for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be available starting at 10am on Friday through Urbtix on a first-come, first-served basis, and they will cost HK$10 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is among the total number of 33,600 seats available for the event, with the government and park operator each responsible for the distribution of 16,800 tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 8,000 tickets will be distributed for free to underprivileged families, charities and other district organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said while the show that starts at 6.30pm would not be broadcast live, the ceremony would be aired later in the evening by four TV channels at 9.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that overseas viewers could also enjoy the broadcast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For overseas viewers, I think they also can [watch] through the apps or through the channels of our different free TV channels... watch it together with the Hong Kong audience at 9.30pm at home in their countries or in their areas," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said although the park is able to live stream the event, the government decided not to do that because the broadcast version would be able to showcase the park’s facilities better.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singers, celebrities and athletes from Hong Kong and the mainland were among those slated to perform at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law did not reveal how much the ceremony cost, but she said the government would spend its budget wisely.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have to give special thanks to all the participating artists and also athletes and performers, most of them actually do not require us to provide a special remuneration, aside from the minimum, for example the makeup or hair-do.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR bosses on Thursday unveiled a new "light rail sightseeing route" to take visitors on a tour of the delights of Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br>
  From February 22, six "Tuen Mun Voyager" trains will run in a circular route on weekends and public holidays. The journey will last about one hour and 15 minutes, although passengers can hop on and off at any of the 12 stops covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  A travel ambassador will be on board to tell passengers about the sights they can see.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company said it has come up with three different itineraries, one for food lovers, another for photography enthusiasts, and a third especially attractive to families.
  <br>
  <br>
  One highlight is Tuen Mun Ferry Pier, where the movie “Beyond the Dream” was filmed, while another is the seafood market near the Sam Shing stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeny Yeung, MTR’s Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, said she hopes the new route will attract people to visit the district as part of the "tourism everywhere" concept.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tuen Mun is a charming place that not many Hong Kong people know. There are many beautiful landmarks, historical buildings and scenery,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this sightseeing route, we hope to draw in locals and tourists to come to Tuen Mun and discover the gems here.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A one-day travel pass costs HK$50 and comes with HK$150 worth of vouchers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Thursday released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, said to include a mother and her two children who had long been feared dead and had come to embody the nation's agony following the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel which triggered the Gaza war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remains were said to be of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest captive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The militants displayed four black coffins on a stage in the Gaza Strip surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fighters then carried the coffins over to Red Cross vehicles, where staffers in red vests covered them in white sheets before placing them inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Cross convoy headed back to Israel, where authorities will carry out the formal identification of the remains using DNA, expected to take up to two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only then will the families be given the final notification. The Israeli military confirmed it had received the coffins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people, including large numbers of masked and armed fighters from Hamas and other factions, gathered at the handover site on the outskirts of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. (AP)

    Handball National Games trials to be held this weekend

<img alt="Yeung Tak-keung said a series of trials for the National Games will take place in Hong Kong in the coming months. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792464_1_20250220161403.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong official who heads an office coordinating the upcoming National Games, Yeung Tak-keung, said he expects around 1,000 spectators to attend a handball tournament serving as a test event for the Games this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day event will take place at the Kai Tak Arena, and comes before the SAR hosts the nationwide sporting tournament with Guangdong and Macau for the first time this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung, who's the former sports commissioner, said on Thursday that workers at the Sports Park are ready after a series of trials in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials were making final adjustments for the tournament this weekend, such as making sure the changing rooms are fine as well as the lighting for the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because for handball, sometimes players need to lob the ball high when they go on a fast break. That means they will look up, so we have to adjust the angle of the lights, and how bright they are," Yeung told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in late March would also be a test event for the National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while it is the first time the mega event would take place at Kai Tak, Yeung doesn't expect much of a problem because the SAR has a wealth of experience in hosting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the test event for beach volleyball would be held around Easter on the football pitches at Victoria Park, and stalls would be set up nearby to promote Hong Kong culture to spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But before that, Yeung said officials want to bring something different for the two-day triathlon trial races starting from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, such events would take place along the harbourfront. But this time, besides having the cycling and running there, a segment of the track will be inside the space for events at the Central Harbourfront," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be stands for the spectators, and other areas for them, so they can be more comfortable, and get a close-up view of the athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said officials would also put up a giant screen in Central for a better viewing experience.

    Hospital doctors to use AI for medical reports

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospital doctors will start using generative AI to help them draft medical reports from next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The technology will be used to summarise a patient's clinical data, including lab results, the Hospital Authority said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chief executive, Tony Ko, said the introduction of AI is to save doctors time when preparing their reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  “All the reports have to be finally checked and authorised by the doctor himself, so the doctors will be responsible for the accuracy of the report that truly reflects his or her decision in terms of what the content is to be included in the report,” Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said it will first test the system at Caritas Medical Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Tin Shui Wai Hospital, Tseung Kwan O Hospital and United Christian Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said that patients will soon be able to get copies of their medical reports via its HA Go app.

    Officials urged to let vacant public flats quicker

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's Ombudsman has urged housing authorities to speed up the turnover of recovered public rental flats, such as by shortening the period between taking back a home and issuing a refurbishment order.
 <br>
  <br>
  A probe by the watchdog revealed that it normally took around two and a half months for a home taken back by the Housing Department to be ready for its next tenants to move in, and nearly three months when the Housing Society carries out the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The procedures for the recovery of flats by the Housing Department and the Housing Society, and their arrangements for refurbishment and reallocation of recovered flats need further revamping, to speed up turnover of public housing flats and ensure optimal utilisation of precious public housing resources," Ombudsman Jack Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past five years, the Housing Department has recovered 15,700 public housing flats annually on average. The Housing Society, meanwhile, took back around 1,100 units each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have taken steps to expedite the refurbishment of recovered flats since the watchdog launched an investigation last year, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the Housing Department would issue a refurbishment works order within three days of a public housing tenant moving out, while the Housing Society set the period to within two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said in its report that the two-week period "might raise doubts among members of the public as to whether it is reasonable".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Housing Society] could bring forward the time for notifying the contractors to start work in the estate," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Housing Department over the past five years managed to refurbish each recovered flat in 43 days, which is in line with its target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninety percent of renovations of homes recovered by the Housing Society met the completion target of 60 days, but Chan said the body should carry out a "comprehensive review" to cut down the refurbishment period.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Housing Department pledged to review and study the recommendations in detail to allocate public housing flats to those in need as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also noted that it has previously looked into introducing measures such as making sure public housing applicants can move in once the refurbishment of their new home is completed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expects President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip.
 <br>
  <br>
  In remarks made to reporters on Air Force One, Trump also said "it's possible" for the two countries to have a new trade deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, the US had already agreed to "a great trade deal with China" and a new deal is possible, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs after the US imposed a 10 percent tariff on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi last travelled to the US in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as president for a summit with then US president Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming," Trump said while also speaking about others leaders visiting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he was talking to China about TikTok as the US seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan. Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. (Reuters/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday approved plans for lower toll fees at the Tai Lam Tunnel when it comes under government control at the end of May.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles will be charged HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during regular periods, and HK$18 at quiet times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tolls for commercial vehicles such as trucks and buses will fall from as high as HK$79 to HK$43 at any time of day, while taxis will be charged HK$28 – less than half the current HK$58 fee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien had proposed making the tunnel free for private cars, motorbikes and commercial vehicles during non-peak hours, but this was rejected by the council, with concerns raised about lost revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel, which stretches between Ting Kau and Yuen Long, is currently owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties. Its 30-year franchise began in 1995.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar on Thursday handed over the first batch of hundreds of Chinese scam centre workers who are set to be repatriated through Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of foreigners are expected to be freed and returned from scam compounds in Myanmar in the coming weeks, starting with 600 Chinese over the next three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The compounds run by criminal gangs are staffed by foreigners, many of whom say they were trafficked and forced to work running internet scams swindling people around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those involved are Chinese and Beijing has stepped up pressure on Myanmar and Thailand to shut the centres down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Karen Border Guard Force, a militia allied with the Myanmar junta, has said it is preparing to deport 10,000 people linked to the compounds in areas it controls on the border with Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two double-decker coaches delivered a first round of returning workers to the border post in the western Thai town of Mae Sot on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First group of 50 Chinese have crossed to Thailand and headed to the airport. There will be three more batches (today), each with 50 Chinese," a local border task force official has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has put on 16 flights over the next three days to ferry 600 of its nationals home direcly from Mae Sot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release follows several visits by Public Security Assistant Minister Liu Zhongyi to Bangkok and the border in recent weeks to arrange the repatriation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scam centres have proliferated across Southeast Asia in recent years, including in Cambodia and the Philippines, as the value of the industry has boomed to billions of US dollars a year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US airline Delta on Wednesday said it will offer US$30,000, or HK$233,395, to each passenger on a plane that crashed as it landed at Toronto airport this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This gesture has no strings attached and does not affect rights" of passengers, a company spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a Delta Air Lines plane that departed from the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, hit the runway hard at Toronto's main airport and flipped upside down.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fireball and thick plumes of black smoke engulfed the plane as it skidded to a halt on its roof but none of the 80 people on board were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delta said 21 passengers were injured in the accident but only one was still hospitalised as of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedic services said emergency responders dealt with various injuries among the passengers, including back sprains, head injuries, anxiety and headaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic footage of the crash posted on social media on Tuesday showed the Bombardier CRJ-900 coming in to land before slamming into the runway, then sliding forward in a roll, with its wings sheared off before it stopped on its back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation, assisted by the US Federal Aviation Administration, Delta and Mitsubishi, which purchased the CRJ line of planes from Bombardier in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toronto crash was the latest in a recent string of air incidents in North America, including a midair collision between a US Army helicopter and a passenger jet in Washington that killed 67 people, and a medical transport plane crash in Philadelphia that left seven dead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky a "dictator" on Wednesday, widening a personal rift with major implications for efforts to end the conflict triggered by Russia's military offensive three years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States has provided essential funding and arms to Ukraine, but Trump made an abrupt policy shift by opening talks with Moscow just weeks after he returned to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a country left," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was elected in 2019 for a five-year term and has remained leader under martial law imposed as his country fights for its survival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump savaged Zelensky, saying "he refuses to have elections, is very low in Ukrainian polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing (Joe) Biden 'like a fiddle.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's popularity has fallen, but the percentage of Ukrainians who trust him has never dipped below 50 percent since the conflict started, according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Biden, the United States had lauded Zelensky as a hero and hammered Moscow with sanctions as Ukraine battled against advancing Russian soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held a press conference on Tuesday in which he tore into the Ukrainian leader and repeated Kremlin narratives such as the claim that Ukraine started the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's invective drew shock from Europe where German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was "wrong and dangerous" to call Zelensky a dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, Trump's former vice president Mike Pence also issued a stinging rebuke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives," Pence wrote on X. (AFP)

    Taxi, ride-hailing rivalry to intensify: expert

<img alt="Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School says there are more players entering the ride-hailing market. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792395_1_20250220085201.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport expert on Thursday said competition between the taxi industry and other ride-hailing services will heat up, after cabbies called off a five-day strike to give authorities more time to carry out enforcement action.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after a meeting with transport officials for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Timothy Hau from the University of Hong Kong's Business School told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  that the taxi drivers' “extreme" and "counterproductive” measures had angered the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[These measures] just make people madder and upset with them and dissatisfied with their services, which I must say is really getting increasingly worse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hau noted that there are more players entering the ride-hailing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With Gaode entering the picture, and Tada more recently, we have a situation in which the government announced that within a year, they're going to regulate ride-hailing services...and so during this period, a lot of companies will come in and get their foot in the door,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They would want to ensure that they have a place once all the regulatory policies are issued…It’s going to be a fairly crowded market,” Hau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi industry has said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also expressed the hope that authorities would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.

    'Constructive' talks after China blasts tariffs at WTO

<img alt="The US, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the WTO discussions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792389_2_20250220104914.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were "constructive", after China accused the US of imposing "tariff shocks" that could upend the global trading system.
 <br>
  <br>
  China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by US President Donald Trump at a World Trade Organization meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced sweeping 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The large majority "stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system", Dieng added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time that mounting trade frictions have been formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao expressed strong dissatisfaction with US tariffs on Chinese goods in a letter addressed to the newly confirmed US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the US to unilaterally impose tariffs undermined normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US", Wang said in the letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Beijing was willing to work with Washington to "strengthen dialogue, manage differences, promote cooperation" and hoped to create a "fair and predictable policy environment" for the two countries' business communities to cooperate. (Reuters)

    Dead or alive: Mosquito bounty in Manila

<img alt="Enthusiasm is high among residents who carried pails, cups and other containers filled with dengue-spreading mosquitoes to exchange for cash. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792349_1_20250219211745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Residents in a central Manila neighbourhood lined up on Wednesday, as dengue cases spike nationwide, to collect a bounty – one peso for every five mosquitoes, dead or alive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carlito Cernal, village captain in Addition Hills, said the awareness-raising project he initiated could have a "huge impact" on curbing the tropical disease's spread when combined with local clean-up efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine health officials and experts were less convinced, but enthusiasm was high among residents who carried pails, cups and other containers filled with dengue-spreading mosquitoes to exchange for cash at the village hall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iluminado Candasua brought three live specimens in a sealed plastic cup that were duly counted and transferred by village officials to their so-called death chamber, a glass-enclosed UV light machine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very hard to capture mosquitoes," Candasua said, explaining how he strategically chose a darkly lit fire station where he used a cup to manually trap the insects against a wall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candasua said the peso he got for his efforts, worth little more than a US penny, would go into a piggy bank he's using to save for a cellphone for his child.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization ranked the Philippines as the country most affected by dengue in the Western Pacific region in 2023 when it had 167,355 cases and 575 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tropical disease, while rarely fatal, carries symptoms ranging from fever and headaches to swollen glands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen an "unusual rise" in cases this year, with 28,200 patients recorded as of February 1, according to Department of Health spokesman Dr Albert Domingo, a 40 percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five cities and municipalities have declared outbreaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Domingo said on Wednesday it was important that local communities consult with health authorities before launching ad hoc efforts, adding that the problem was best addressed by "going back to the fundamentals".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sooner we clean our surroundings and overturn any possible areas where stagnant water is collecting, then we will have a better fight against dengue," he said, urging residents to protect themselves with insect repellent and long sleeves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Public health expert Anthony Leachon said that while he welcomed all anti-dengue initiatives, the Addition Hills roundup would have "little or no impact at all".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some residents, he warned, might even exacerbate the problem by cultivating mosquitoes for coins.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Rachel Estoque did not intentionally breed mosquitoes, the haul she turned in on Wednesday came from a source of stagnant water in her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 45-year-old housewife said she woke up early to catch mosquito larvae growing in water in her flower pot. The 20 larvae earned her four pesos, enough for a tiny packet of cooking oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  But like others waiting to trade in their catch, Estoque said the money was less important than the principle involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My child suffered from dengue before and I know how scary and difficult that is... that's why I'm participating in this project," she said. (AFP)

    S&amp;P 500 adds to its record as US stocks drift higher

<img alt="The S&P 500 posts a second straight record following a choppy session amid lingering worries about US tariffs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792388_1_20250220073209.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 added to its record as US stock indexes drifted through a quiet Wednesday on Wall Street.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 71 points, or 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq composite inched up by 0.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 upward. It rose 1.3 percent after saying it had developed what it calls the world’s first “quantum processing unit,” which could lead to the development of much more powerful computers. While the gain was relatively modest, Microsoft's gargantuan size gives its stock's movements huge sway on the S&P 500 and other indexes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 9.7 percent rally for Analog Devices also helped push the market higher. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a “challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk’s Tesla rose 1.8 percent. It climbed after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 39.1 percent following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it would try to sell off its assets and wind down its business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased a bit on Wednesday and edged down to 4.53 percent from 4.55 percent late on Tuesday. It was below 3.70 percent as recently as September and approaching 4.80 percent within the past few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the bond and the stock markets have increasingly been taking US President Donald Trump’s tariffs in stride, after earlier showing much more trepidation. The hope on Wall Street is that Trump is using such threats merely as a tool to drive negotiations, and the ultimate effects won’t be as bad as they initially appeared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minutes released for the Fed’s last policy meeting in January showed officials discussed how Trump’s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year
  <br>
  <br>
  In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6 percent after a report showed UK inflation accelerated to a 10-month high. That could put pressure on the Bank of England, which had been cutting interest rates to invigorate its tepid economy. (AP)

    Mbappé hat-trick dumps City out of Champions League

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé struck a brilliant hat-trick for Champions League holders Real Madrid in a 3-1 win over Manchester City, helping Los Blancos reach the last 16 with a 6-3 aggregate victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's side, shorn of key striker Erling Haaland, suffered a painful early exit without laying a glove on the completely dominant 15-time record winners in the Spanish capital, until Nico González tapped home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  French superstar Mbappé broke the deadlock with a lob in the fourth minute and netted a fine second after combining with his attacking partners as the English side were sliced open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The striker, in sensational form after a slow start to life at Madrid, completed his treble in the second half with a low strike from the edge of the box to reach seven goals in the competition this season in 10 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to win and go through because for us it was logical that Real Madrid would be in the last 16 of the Champions League," Mbappé said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has scored 28 goals this season, with 18 in his last 18 games across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said it before, I didn't come to Real Madrid to play badly," continued Mbappé. "Making my dream come true is one thing, but I want to play well here – mark an era and make history at Real Madrid."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who won the competition in 2023, were a far cry from their best as has been the case for much of their campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best team won, they deserve to be there and we don't," admitted Guardiola. "We had a bad year in the competition – when you finish 22nd in the group, it's because we haven't been good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been our worst year," he added. "We've been an incredible team and this year, for many reasons, we have lost that consistency."
  <br>
  <br>
  City were dealt bad news before the game with Haaland, who netted twice in the first leg, named on the bench after a suffering a knock at the weekend against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side performed almost flawlessly from the off and took the lead in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé shrugged off Ruben Dias and lofted the ball over City goalkeeper Ederson after young centre-back Raul Asencio played him in with a long pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not easy when you concede such an early goal," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Stones limped off for the visitors a few minutes later in another blow for the Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé netted his second in the 33rd minute after Madrid's "fantastic four" star players combined. Jude Bellingham fed Vinicius who rolled the ball across for Rodrygo, who nudged it to Mbappé.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Paris Saint-Germain forward slipped inside to leave the flailing Josko Gvardiol sliding in the wrong direction and drilled home at the near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola had claimed City only had "one percent chance" of beating Madrid and his team played like they believed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's only blot on their copybook was a booking for Bellingham for fouling England team-mate Phil Foden, leaving him suspended for the last 16 first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham, who caused a stir after being sent off for dissent last weekend in La Liga, was assured in midfield but the night belonged to Mbappé.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old completed his hat-trick just after the hour mark, opening up some space on the edge of the box and firing beyond Ederson as City's defence stood off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé departed to a standing ovation and Madrid fans marvelled at the ease of their team's victory, against an opponent with whom they have shared many close battles in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors pulled a goal back in stoppage time when Omar Marmoush crashed a free-kick against the crossbar and González rolled home the rebound, but it offered scant consolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost 13 games in their last 26 across all competitions, and face Premier League leaders Liverpool next on Sunday, with a battle to finish in the top four on their hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Madrid the last 16 is a clash with either city rivals Atletico or German champions Bayer Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played a complete game in attack, defence, possession and transition," said a satisfied Ancelotti. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League title charge was slowed by Aston Villa after a pulsating 2-2 draw left neither side satisfied.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's men open up an eight-point lead at the top of the table over second-placed Arsenal, but the Gunners now have a game in hand over the Reds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool led through Mohamed Salah but were also forced to come from behind after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins swung momentum in Villa's favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold's deflected shot secured a point for the visitors, but it should have been more as substitute Darwin Núñez missed a glorious chance to snatch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can understand there is one person in the dressing room who feels quite down," said Slot on Núñez's late miss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you watch the game back we created far more chances than them, we did everything we needed to do. The only thing that wasn't perfect was conceding from a set-piece."
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, though, could also have won it in stoppage time as Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen went close.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A draw I think is fair for both teams because they had also chances to score," said Villa boss Unai Emery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are now 22 Premier League games unbeaten, but a second 2-2 draw in eight days offers Arsenal hope in the title race, especially as Slot's side visit Manchester City on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're happy where we are," added Slot. "A bit too much now we played games where we deserve more than we got. "We want to achieve something together this season and we have all the ingredients for it but still 12 games to go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were handed their first Villa starts by Unai Emery as he reacted to a disappointing 1-1 draw against 10-man Ipswich on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford nearly had a hand in the opening goal but had strayed offside before his cross was turned into his own net by Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa were masters of their own downfall when the opener did arrive on 29 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andres Garcia's backpass went straight to Diogo Jota, who unselfishly squared for Salah to fire in his 29th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa were level within nine minutes as Liverpool failed to properly clear a free-kick into the box and the ball fell kindly to Tielemans, who produced a classy finish on the volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota should have restored the visitors' advantage immediately when be blazed high and wide with just Emi Martínez to beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead it was Villa who led at half-time as poor Liverpool defending allowed Watkins a free run to meet Lucas Digne's cross with a header into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford's one big chance to make his mark for his new club arrived just seconds into the second half when he skipped past the onrushing Alisson Becker, but could not beat Ibrahima Konate's towering presence as the French defender headed wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Liverpool onslaught duly followed to extend Slot's run of never having lost an away Premier League game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota curled a fine effort from the edge of the box off the bar. Alexander-Arnold was a growing influence on the game when he levelled on the hour mark with the aid of a deflection off Tyrone Mings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot threw on Luis Díaz and Núñez off the bench in search of a winner and one of his substitutes should have delivered a vital three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Núñez had an open goal to aim at after being picked out by Dominik Szoboszlai but fired over to the disbelief of his manager. Martínez then had to rush off his line to deny Nunez another clear run on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, though, had the majority of the chances in a frantic finale. Jacob Ramsey's strike was ruled out for offside before Rogers and Malen's powerful drives flew just off target. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis's heart is holding up very well despite his pneumonia, a Vatican source said on Wednesday, amid growing concerns over the hospitalised 88-year-old's condition.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff was admitted to a Rome hospital with bronchitis last week after suffering breathing difficulties, but the Holy See revealed on Tuesday evening that he had developed pneumonia in both of his lungs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope spent a peaceful night, woke up and had breakfast," the Vatican said on Wednesday after Francis's fifth night at the Gemelli hospital, which has a suite reserved especially for popes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is breathing on his own. His heart is holding up very well," a source in the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis has been speaking to friends by telephone, has been out of bed and sitting in a chair, and working on and off, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, the Vatican had reported that Francis was in "good spirits."
  <br>
  <br>
  But in an evening medical bulletin, it warned that "the laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father's clinical condition continue to present a complex picture."
  <br>
  <br>
  A "polymicrobial infection" which has come on top of "bronchiectasis and asthmatic bronchitis, and which required the use of cortisone antibiotic therapy, makes therapeutic treatment more complex," the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff had part of his right lung cut away when he was 21, after developing pleurisy that almost killed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican has cancelled a papal audience on Saturday and said the pope would not attend mass on Sunday, although it has yet to announce plans for his weekly Angelus prayer, which is held on Sunday at midday. (AFP)

    Trump says auto tariffs to be around 25pc

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump expanded his offensive against trading partners on Tuesday, threatening 25 percent tariffs on imported cars, and similar or higher duties on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced a broad range of levies on some of the biggest US trading partners since taking office in January, arguing that they will help tackle unfair practices – and in some cases using the threats to influence policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recently pledged 10 percent duties on all goods coming from China, and 25 on steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, he told reporters that tariffs on the automobile industry will "be in the neighbourhood of 25 percent," with specifics to come around April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threatened tariffs on pharmaceuticals and chips, Trump said: "It'll be 25 percent and higher, and it'll go very substantially higher over (the) course of a year."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he wanted to give affected companies time to bring their operations to the United States, saying that he had been contacted by major firms that "want to come back."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also said that Washington's trading partners could avoid being taxed by investing in factories in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to give them time to come in," he said. "When they come into the United States and they have their plant or factory here, there is no tariff. So we want to give them a little bit of a chance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have warned it is often Americans who end up paying the cost of tariffs on imports, rather than foreign exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers. (AFP)

    Man Utd spent £14.5mn on sackings including Ten Hag

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United paid a total of £14.5 million (US$18.3 million) to sack manager Erik ten Hag, sporting director Dan Ashworth and other members of their football staff, according to the fallen English giants' latest accounts published on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  United, the 20-time champions of England, are currently a lowly 15th in the Premier League table following Sunday's 1-0 loss at Tottenham, with only West Ham and Wolves between them and the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope for a 'bounce' in results under new manager Ruben Amorim has failed to materialise since the Portuguese boss replaced Ten Hag, who was sacked in October just 116 days after United triggered a clause to extend the Dutchman's contract until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  A costly decision taken by minority owner Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS group was compounded by the rapid exit from Old Trafford of Ashworth, who arrived from Newcastle on July 1 following lengthy talks only to leave on December 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial expense of those decisions was laid bare in United's results for the quarter ending December 31 under 'exceptional items'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £14.5 million," said a United press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This relates to costs associated with the departure of former men's first team manager Erik ten Hag and various members of football staff."
  <br>
  <br>
  United confirmed in their first quarter results that the pay-off to Ten Hag and his staff was worth £10.4 million, indicating Ashworth's departure cost some £4.1 million. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Emma Raducanu was targeted by "a man who exhibited fixated behaviour" during the WTA 1000 tournament in Dubai, tennis officials said on Wednesday, after the former US Open champion was reduced to tears on court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old Briton was down 2-0 in the first set against Karolina Muchova on Tuesday when she approached the umpire, then briefly took refuge behind the umpire's chair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muchova went over to see what was wrong before the 2021 New York champion Raducanu reappeared, wiping away tears with her towel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Women's Tennis Association said it would ban the man after what it called "the security incident in Dubai."
  <br>
  <br>
  "On Monday, February 17, Emma Raducanu was approached in a public area by a man who exhibited fixated behaviour," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma's match on Tuesday at the Dubai Duty-Free Tennis Championships and subsequently ejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, a London court issued a five-year restraining order against a man who stalked the British tennis star, including making several visits to her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTA said in its statement that it "is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Republic's Muchova won the second-round match 7-6 (8/6), 6-4. (AFP)

 Police on Wednesday said they intercepted eight private cars in a citywide undercover operation targeting illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight drivers, aged between 36 and 63, were suspected of using their cars for illegal hire or reward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three vehicles were seized for further investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police will continue to deploy manpower based on operational priorities to combat illegal vehicle hire or reward activities," said Cheng Ho-ming, a senior inspector with the force.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officer did not reveal whether the eight drivers were arrested, and which ride-hailing platforms were involved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing commerce official on Wednesday pledged further support for Hong Kong under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the city's free-trade deal with the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Shijie, the director-general of the Commerce Ministry's Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, told a forum that the central government is committed to backing the city's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will, under the CEPA framework, continue to promote opening up and cooperation with Hong Kong, and support Hong Kong to better integrate into national development," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support different departments in implementing preferential measures under CEPA, and will continue to strengthen opening up and cooperation under the agreement to support investors in Hong Kong and around the world to enter the mainland via Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  An agreement signed last year between the two sides to amend the framework on trade in services under CEPA will come into effect next month. Changes include removing or loosening restrictions on equity shareholding and business scope across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maggie Wong, Hong Kong's permanent secretary for commerce and economic development, said the changes are beneficial to sectors such as financial services, telecommunications, and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government will make the trade make good use of a number of preferential measures, and will continue to seek to jointly promote a higher level of opening up and closer economic and trade cooperation with the mainland on the basis of CEPA, so as to maximise the space of development for the trade on the mainland," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration must take measures to defend free trade amid challenges posed by unilateralism and protectionism, the official added.

 Banking giant HSBC on Wednesday revealed that Hong Kong employees whose roles are related to its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well as equity capital market (ECM) businesses could be affected, as it kicks off a fresh round of job cuts worldwide as part of measures to slash costs by US$1.5 billion by the end of 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its new chief executive, George Elhedery, said the group is looking at cutting its global personnel expenses by eight percent over 2025 and 2026, as it withdraws from mergers and acquisitions banking activity in the UK, Europe, and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an online press conference, Elhedery refused to say how many jobs will go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them definitely relate to M&A and the ECM in UK, Europe, and the US. All those supporting this activity will be possibly impacted, but also in these areas of the bank, in particular investment banking, there will be continuous adjustment of the workforce, both to clients, to activities, and to proposition," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say that partly would be a normal course of business, and partly is related to the investment banking decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Pam Kaur, the HSBC's chief financial officer, said that risks related to its Hong Kong property business book has been very low and that the group is expecting a positive outlook for the SAR's real estate industry going forward, following reduced interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sector has been challenged because of rental prices and interest rates and vacancy levels. However, this year we have seen some positive momentum, both in terms of the volume and the price of property transactions in Hong Kong is increasing," she noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC added that businesses on the mainland remain resilient.

 The Polytechnic University of Hong Kong (PolyU) is willing to stand with the government amid potential funding cuts, the institution's council head said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education officials earlier said the University Grants Committee will adjust funding for the territory’s eight universities due to a significant government deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Tai-fai, chairman of PolyU’s council, told a media gathering that such cuts would definitely affect the university, and the institution is looking at ways to reduce expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, he stressed the university will continue to push ahead with its development plans and recruitment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, PolyU's president, Jin-Guang Teng, said the university is working on a proposal to set up Hong Kong's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university has many years of experience in offering medical-related courses with hundreds and thousands of graduates, Teng said, adding that he believes PolyU has what it takes to establish a medical school.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump's special envoy was in Kyiv on Wednesday, saying he was there to "listen" to Kyiv's concerns, a day after the US president tore into his Ukrainian counterpart in a surprise press conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Tuesday, after Russian and US officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first high-level talks in over three years without Ukraine taking part, Trump appeared to blame Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for having "started" the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I heard, 'oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had chided the US-Russia talks for not including Kyiv, saying efforts to end the war must be "fair and involve European countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv by train on Wednesday morning on what he said was a mission to "sit and listen" to Kyiv's concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand the need for security guarantees... Part of my mission is to sit and listen and say: what are your concerns?" Kellogg said in a video posted by Ukraine's Suspilne news outlet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the United States agreed on Tuesday to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv and its European allies have become alarmed at being cut out of the process with Russia to end the conflict. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday proposed amendments to the Trade Unions Ordinance to improve the regulatory regime and better safeguard national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the changes, the Registrar of Trade Unions could reject new registrations or amalgamations on national security grounds, with no appeal allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  People convicted of national security offences would be barred from becoming trade union officers or promoters, and unions would be banned from joining any external political organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to join a non-political group outside the SAR, trade unions would have to obtain approval from the chief executive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unions would also have to apply to the registrar before receiving any external funds, and any approved funds could not be used for local elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said the amendments protect employees' right and freedom to form and join trade unions in accordance with the Basic Law, the Bill of Rights Ordinance and relevant international conventions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[The amendments] definitely won’t hinder the development of trade unions. They will even promote a healthier development of Hong Kong's trade unions,” said Deputy Commissioner for Labour Raymond Ho.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amendments are to be tabled to the Legislative Council in April.

    Man to be charged over suspicious SMS messages

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said that a man had been arrested on suspicion of scamming people by sending phishing text messages that start with a hashtag.
 <br>
  <br>
  A little more than a year ago, authorities introduced a scheme under which registered firms and organisations can send messages that start with the symbol, in a bid to combat scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers received around 30 reports in the past week about suspected fraud messages with the hashtag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers then arrested the suspect, 23, on Monday, and plan to lay charges against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After careful planning, officers arrested the man in Mong Kok on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud," said senior inspector Wan Chun-hong from the police's Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspect was inside a van, and police seized two mobile phones and a radio jammer that was in operation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan said at a police briefing that one victim claimed to have lost around HK$22,000 after clicking a hyperlink from a suspicious text message and giving out credit card information.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Communications Authority said they found that some of the recent suspicious hashtag messages were not sent out by local telecommunication firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal regulatory affairs manager Andrew Lo said people should be extra careful when they see their phone signal dip suddenly from maximum coverage to 2G, as messages they receive during that period could be from people using illicit radio jammers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The jammers would pretend to be a 2G base station, because under this standard, mobile phones generally won't authenticate the 2G station," he said at the same briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's possible to deceive these phones, connect to their network and send fraudulent messages to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that extra caution is also needed when the messages involve strange hyperlinks, or that they ask for money.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ride-sharing operators and the taxi trade can coexist under a "balanced and sustainable" framework on regulating car-hailing services, Uber's boss in Hong Kong said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Estyn Chung, Uber Hong Kong’s general manager, also said he's hopeful for further exchanges with the government and the taxi industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that a balanced and sustainable regulatory framework will allow taxis and ride-sharing to co-exist for the benefit of all Hongkongers, for Hongkongers to have more choice when it comes to point-to-point transportation," Chung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it's really important to protect the flexibility and earnings opportunity of drivers, and also to protect the safety and service quality for all Hongkongers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives from Uber attended an afternoon meeting with government officials to share their views on regulating ride-hailing platforms in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, taxi industry representatives held talks with transport authorities before deciding to call off a planned strike to push for a crackdown on illegal ride-hailing services in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is seeking to introduce a regulatory framework to the Legislative Council on ride-sharing platforms, with authorities stressing illegal services would not be tolerated.

<img alt="HSBC said pre-tax profits rose six percent to $32.3 billion in 2024 as the bank undergoes a structural overhaul. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792282_1_20250219150836.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC posted an annual profit on Wednesday that beat estimates, helped by increased revenue in its wealth and markets businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  It reported profit before tax for 2024 of US$32.3 billion, a rise of around six percent, as income withstood the impact of falling interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  That compared with US$30.3 billion a year earlier and the US$31.7 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Asia-focused lender also announced a new US$2 billion share buyback which it plans to complete before next earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figures come against the backdrop of CEO Georges Elhedery embarking on costly restructuring just as the business outlook is muddied by divergence in central bank interest rate policies, with the euro zone having room to cut rates, the US holding steady and Japan expected to raise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elhedery, who took the helm in September last year, has been taking steps to boost returns and tighten the London-headquartered bank's focus on Asia, where it earns the bulk of its profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank said it aimed to generate about US$300 million of cost reductions in 2025, with a commitment to an annualised reduction of US$1.5 billion in cost base expected by the end of 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have renewed vigour in finding the efficiencies that will optimise our resource allocation, be that geographical, business line or balance sheet," Elhedery said in the bank's earnings statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will enhance the way we actively and dynamically manage costs and capital, and target investments." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The taxi industry has called off a strike next month to push for a crackdown on illegal ride-hailing services, after meeting with transport officials on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association had earlier threatened five days of industrial action from March 5, saying their business was seriously hurt by their unlicensed rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Wong Yu-ting, apologised after the meeting for causing "unease" to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added authorities should be given time to take enforcement action, so a strike was no longer necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong maintained the government should take action against ride-hailing service providers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of arrestees (ride-hailing drivers) is actually not the top priority. Most importantly, they should take immediate action to prosecute the drivers, so as to deter others from doing so," Wong told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi Council, described the meeting as positive and constructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would submit a legislative proposal within this year to regulate ride hailing platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ride-hailing platforms must ensure all the vehicles hailed from their platforms must have legal licence," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hoped the government would require ride-hailing service providers to attend professional training beforehand, and have their vehicles undergo inspections annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said the government was looking at next steps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is now studying with the Department of Justice on fine-tuning existing laws to optimise the enforcement process," she added.

<img alt="Peter Lam will begin his term on April 1. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792261_3_20250219142136.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has reappointed Peter Lam as the chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) for a three-year term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam, who succeeds Pang Yiu-kai, will begin his term on April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman also served as the board's chairman between 2013 and 2019, before passing the reins to Pang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said in a statement that Lam's diverse experience in business management and public services makes him the best candidate for the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident that under Dr Lam's leadership, the board will advance further while promoting Hong Kong worldwide and showcasing its charms, so that visitors will indulge in pleasure when staying in Hong Kong, thinking about Hong Kong, and returning time and again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also currently serves as the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, a position that will soon be handed over to former commerce chief Frederick Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law expressed gratitude to Pang for his leadership in navigating the numerous challenges posed by the Covid pandemic and for spearheading the recovery of Hong Kong's tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTB added that under Pang's leadership, Hong Kong welcomed nearly 45 million visitors in 2024, solidifying its status as a premier destination for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions tourism, cruises and overall tourism, while serving as a crucial gateway for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said it has been a privilege to serve the community over the past six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very grateful to the government, the travel trade, my fellow HKTB members and the team for the support they have given me throughout the years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue to work closely with HKTB team to promote ‘Hong Kong Super March’ and fully support the work of HKTB going forward. I wish HKTB and Dr Lam every success.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has also appointed Jeffrey Lam, Nikki Ng and Melissa Pang as new members of the board.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has appointed former commerce chief Frederick Ma as the new chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, succeeding Peter Lam.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ma's two-year term will run from June 1, 2025 to May 31, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said in a statement that Ma’s extensive experience in public service and the commercial sector makes him well-suited for the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident that he will lead the HKTDC to make every effort in assisting enterprises to embrace the challenges arising from the ever changing global trading landscape and actively tap new markets and business opportunities, with a view to further promoting Hong Kong's development as an international trade centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also thanked Lam for his contributions during his tenure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under his chairmanship, the HKTDC has successfully promoted Hong Kong as a two way global investment and business hub and assisted Hong Kong companies in further exploring the business opportunities in the mainland and overseas brought by the nation's dual circulation strategy, with outstanding achievements particularly in promoting Hong Kong in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and emerging markets under the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma currently serves as the non-executive chairman of the FWD Group and is a member of the Chief Executive’s Council of Advisers.

    'Ne Zha 2' to hit HK cinemas on Saturday

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792229_1_20250219103021.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Record-breaking blockbuster "Ne Zha 2" is set for general release in Hong Kong on Saturday, as it dethroned Disney's "Inside Out 2" and became the highest grossing animated film of all time -- based on domestic ticketing data.
 <br>
  <br>
  It premiered in the city on Tuesday night, after it garnered significant attention in the SAR over the past month, which saw the animated movie break records for the number of distributors and daily screenings for a mainland film in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are honoured to bring this world-class phenomenon-level animation to Hong Kong and Macau, allowing viewers to experience the charm of Ne Zha in the theatres," said a representative of Emperor Motion Pictures, which is a co-distributor of the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some local fans went to Shenzhen to see the animation, ahead of its SAR release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen online comments about the animated film, saying it is a good and touching movie with an excellent storyline that's enlightening for viewers," said a Hongkonger who viewed the movie across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I specifically watched the first movie in Hong Kong and came today to watch its sequel here in Shenzhen, as it hasn't been screened in Hong Kong. I want to see what makes this animation so successful in attracting many adults and to learn about the latest development of Chinese animation."
  <br>
  <br>
  A sequel to the 2019 hit "Ne Zha 1", "Ne Zha 2" has already packed out cinemas in China, where it claimed the title of the nation's biggest box-office hit since its release last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media, citing ticketing platform, Maoyan, said on Tuesday the fantasy epic had raked in over 12.32 billion yuan (US$1.72 billion), which surpassed "Inside Out 2" that took US$1.7 billion following its release last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2" tells the tale of a rebellious young deity who uses his powers to battle formidable foes after his village is destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film was released overseas this month, sparking hopes that it would garner similar acclaim abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The original "Ne Zha" became what was then China's highest-grossing animated film, after it was released in 2019.

    Rapper A$AP Rocky found not guilty in assault trial

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Musician A$AP Rocky was found not guilty of two counts of felony assault at the conclusion of a trial in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The musician, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has two children with the singer Rihanna. He would've faced more than two decades in prison if he had been convicted of the alleged attack on a former friend in Hollywood in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the weeks-long trial, prosecutors said Mayers had shot a nine-millimetre semi-automatic weapon during a confrontation with Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, on November 6, 2021, in the heart of Hollywood, grazing Ephron's hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mayers, 36, had insisted he had been carrying only a harmless prop gun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles courtroom, full of fans of the hip-hop performer and his singing superstar partner, exploded into screaming glee as Rocky and Rihanna embraced and sobbed at the not guilty verdict from jurors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank y’all for saving my life," he told the jurors as they left the Los Angeles courtroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rihanna cried and hugged the defence lawyers, as did Rocky.
  <br>
  <br>
  She attended the trial sporadically and brought the couple’s two sons – two-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and one-year-old Riot Rose Mayers – for some of the closing arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The verdict came at the height of Rocky’s fame, if not the pinnacle of his music career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-time Grammy nominee, fashion mogul and actor has a banner year in the works, and can now look to it without the threat of prison hanging over him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is scheduled to headline the Rolling Loud music festival in March; he is one of the celebrity co-chairs of fashion’s biggest night, the Met Gala, in May; and he stars with Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee’s film “Highest 2 Lowest,” set for release in early summer. (Agencies)

    More community pharmacies to be set up: Lo Chung-mau

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Wednesday the government plans to establish up to five community pharmacies in each district, so patients can more easily get their medicine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Lo said through the Hospital Authority’s centralised procurement, patients and private doctors can get cheaper medicine for chronic and episodic illnesses at community pharmacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said community pharmacies will also help to reduce drug wastage as patients need not take home several months’ worth of medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With community pharmacies, citizens will not need to get months of medication at one time. They can get one month of medication after visiting the doctor,” Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They also don't need to have a monthly follow-up appointment to get the same medicine. Instead, they can go to a community pharmacy to fill a prescription,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also expressed the hope that citizens would consult their own family doctors first for minor illnesses or chronic diseases. He added residents can select a general practitioner in their neighbourhood from a list of eligible doctors provided at District Health Centres (DHC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, there are seven DHCs in the city, located in Kwai Tsing, Sham Shui Po, Southern District, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Wong Tai Sin and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government has subsidised family doctors in the community to provide screening services for diabetes and hypertension for eligible citizens.

<img alt="An HR expert says Hong Kong firms need to offer attractive pay to lure Islamic finance professionals to the SAR. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792212_1_20250219084656.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources expert on Wednesday said the latest government move to expand Hong Kong's Talent List is the right one, and will help plug holes in the SAR's workforce.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, officials announced that aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to the list from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, Hong Kong has a very serious shortage of these talents," Roy Ying, the co-chair of the advocacy and policy research committee at the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that aircraft engineering and maintenance firms such as Haeco has had to go overseas to recruit engineers all the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ying also said the government has been proactive in addressing the needs of employers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also think that the government is actively listening to the industries because these new jobs, they don't just land on the Talent List. It's a collaboration between the government and the industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously the government sees a serious shortage and that's why these [jobs] are added to the Talent List."
  <br>
  <br>
  On bringing in more Islamic finance professionals to the SAR, he said Hong Kong firms not only have to offer attractive pay in order to compete with market leaders Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, but the territory also has to be become more Muslim friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of halal restaurants, we only have about 132 in Hong Kong... and most organisations don't have prayer rooms, so we have to make our city a little more embracing to attract these people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't just want them to come, we want them to also bring their families... we have to get people who want to call Hong Kong home."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia and the United States agreed on Tuesday to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war in Ukraine after talks that drew a strong rebuke from Kyiv over its exclusion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington noted European nations would have to have a seat at the negotiating table "at some point", following the first high-level official Washington-Moscow talks since the 2022 war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some European leaders, alarmed by President Donald Trump's overhaul of US policy on Russia, fear Washington will make serious concessions to Moscow and re-write the continent's security arrangement in a Cold War-style deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed his nation's exclusion from the Riyadh gathering, which lasted for more than four hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that any talks aimed at ending the war should be "fair" and involve European countries, including Turkey - which offered to host negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will only be feeding Putin's appetite," a Ukrainian senior official requesting anonymity said, referring to the launch of talks without Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov agreed to "appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible", the State Department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington added the sides had also agreed to "establish a consultation mechanism" to address "irritants" to Russia and America's relationship, noting the sides would lay the groundwork for future cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide, confirmed the negotiating teams' appointment but said it was "difficult" to discuss a date for a potential Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump brushed aside Ukraine's concern about being left out of the meeting and suggested he could meet President Putin shortly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was now more confident of a deal to end the Ukraine war after the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting marks a major diplomatic coup for Moscow, which had been isolated for three years under the previous US administration of president Joe Biden. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich secured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 94th minute strike by Alphonso Davies to secure a 1-1 draw on the night and a 3-2 aggregate win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayern will face either their fellow German rivals Bayer Leverkusen or Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic had led 1-0 since the 63rd minute and the Scottish side had been on the verge of taking the German giants to extra time and pulling off their first ever win in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with Harry Kane off injured and time running out, Davies stepped up as Bayern's saviour, tapping in after Celtic keeper Kasper Schmeichel had kept out Leon Goretzka's header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern went into this game 2-1 up from last week's first leg at Celtic Park and seeking to stretch their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern dominated possession in the first half but Celtic were more dangerous with at least three clear cut chances to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Bayern Munich second-team player, Nicolas Kuehn beat Manuel Neuer but Raphael Guerreiro cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later, Alistair Johnston flashed a dangerous ball across the Bayern goal. With Neuer stranded the ball flew just beyond Daizen Maeda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then Maeda missed a golden opportunity to put Celtic ahead. When Dayot Upamecano was forced into a stray pass, Kuehn led the surge forward and fed Maeda, who blazed over with Kuehn and Jota in support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern dominated the ball on a freezing night but suffered with a lack of quality in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serge Gnabry was wasteful while Kane sometimes cut an isolated figure, starved of service. The England captain's best chance saw him rattling the bar with a snapshot after Josip Stanisic picked him out from the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  That would be Kane's final action. The striker was withdrawn at half time, feeling the effects of an injury picked up against Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern upped the pressure after the break and fashioned a clear chance when Goretzka went clean through. Schmeichel, however, made a crucial stop to keep Celtic in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, Celtic were in front. Maeda seized on a loose pass by Josip Stanisic and helped it on toward Kuehn. Min-Jae Kim reached the ball first but could not clear and Kuehn was able to take a touch and find the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a goal that shocked the Allianz Arena and threatened Bayern's record of 20 European home games unbeaten. Celtic were delivering on coach Brendan Rodgers' pre-match battle cry to show bravery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern sought an equaliser but Vincent Kompany's side were reduced to long-range shots, with Schmeichel pulling off saves from Joshua Kimmich, Michael Olise and substitute Leroy Sane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic were moments away from inflicting Bayern's first defeat by a Scottish team and taking the tie into extra-time but the game had a sting in the tail. Olise delivered a pinpoint cross that was met by Goretzka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schmeichel saved but Davies scrambled the rebound home off his shin to send Bayern through to the last 16. (AFP)

    China condemns US 'tariff shocks' at WTO

<img alt="Li Chenggang, China's Ambassador to the WTO, warns against what he says is US unilateralism disrupting the rules-based multilateral trading system. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792198_1_20250219060325.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sweeping tariffs threatened or imposed by US President Donald Trump risk triggering inflation, market distortions, and even a global recession, China said on Tuesday at the World Trade Organization.
 <br>
  <br>
  After returning to office on January 20, Trump slapped China, the world's second-biggest economy, with an additional 10 percent levy on products entering the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump signed executive orders last week imposing new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world faces a series of tariff shocks," said Li Chenggang, China's ambassador to the WTO, at the first meeting of the year of the global trade body's decision-making General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has imposed or threatened tariffs on its trading partners, including China, unilaterally and arbitrarily, blatantly violating WTO rules. China firmly opposes such measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariff shocks heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global recession."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li went on to say that US unilateralism threatened to upend the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stakes are high for all members, big or small," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imposing punitive tariffs on countries with high trade surpluses with the United States has been at the heart of Trump's economic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He paused 25 percent levies against Canada and Mexico for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump went ahead with tariffs on China, which imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting US coal and liquified natural gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Geneva-based trade official said Washington in return voiced concerns that China was operating a non-market economic system and habitually breached WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US highlighted the issues stemming from China's lack of transparency and its disregard for WTO oversight," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US also pointed out that the WTO's current inability to address China's market-distorting policies, such as unfair subsidies, significantly diminishes the organisation's effectiveness." (AFP)

    Berrettini ends Djokovic comeback at Qatar Open

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic's comeback came to a crashing halt as he lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 to Matteo Berrettini in the second round of the Qatar Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who was seeded third and received a first-round bye, was playing his first match since limping out of his Australian Open semi-final in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Serb said that while he was not 100 per cent, fitness was not the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was outplayed by just a better player today," he said. "Yes, I wasn't at my desired level, and it could be that I'm still not moving the way I want to move, but I played without pain, so there is no excuse in that."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he played a masterclass match to be honest, tactically, and served very well, so just a very deserved win from his side," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Berrettini's second win this year, and his first over a player in the top 10 since 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the Italian's first ever win over Djokovic. Their previous encounters included victories for the Serb in the Wimbledon final and Roland Garros quarterfinals, both in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Something I've been looking to do for a long time. I've played against him in the most important tournaments on tour," the 28-year-old Italian said on court after the victory. "I wish I could have won one of those matches."
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini has struggled with injuries over the last 18 months but won three tournaments after returning to court last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Really happy with my performance," he said. "Really happy because I enjoyed my time out there, which is the most important thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first set went with serve but Berrettini took two points off Djokovic's serve to win the tiebreak. The Italian then broke to love in the second game of the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic had broken Berrettini 27 times in their four previous encounters but the Italian was comfortable on serve until the final game before finally winning on his second match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A champion like Novak is always ready to come back," Berrettini said. "You don't have to think about match point. You have to think about the next point."
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic said that Andy Murray had agreed to continue as his coach "indefinitely" but said that he did not plan to overhaul his style.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am trying to improve my game, like everybody else. But my game is not going to change now drastically," Djokovic said. "My game is what it is, the core is going to be the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are more injuries. Things are not the same as 10 years ago, 15 years ago. I still try to take care of my body on a daily basis, and it's more challenging now, no doubt. I still try to do my very best, given the circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alex de Minaur celebrated his birthday by beating Russian Roman Safiullin 6-1, 7-5, even though the Australian did not enjoy the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're tough days, these ones," said De Minaur. "It's cold, it's windy, you probably don't want to get out of bed. But once you step on court, you have to do everything you can to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's ugly or pretty tennis, you just put the ball in the court, and that's what I did today," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, world number six Daniil Medvedev eliminated compatriot and defending champion Karen Khachanov 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev has not won a tournament since the Rome Masters in spring 2023. He was knocked out in the second round of this year's Australian Open by teenage American Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third Russian former champion, Andrey Rublev, the fifth seed, beat Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-4. (AFP)

<img alt='According to a court filing on Monday by the director of the Office of Administration, Musk "is an employee of the White House." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792176_1_20250218223453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk is not an official employee of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and has "no formal authority to make government decisions," according to a White House court filing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man is widely seen as the de-facto head of Doge, created by President Donald Trump, which has sought to drastically reduce US government spending including with thousands of job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had announced in November that "the Great Elon Musk... will lead the Department of Government Efficiency ('DOGE')."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the filing on Monday by Joshua Fisher, director of the Office of Administration, Musk "is an employee of the White House... as a non-career Special Government Employee" and a "Senior Advisor to the President."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like other senior White House advisors, Mr Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself. Mr Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President's directives," Fisher said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US Doge Service is a component of the Executive Office of the President. The US Doge Service Temporary Organisation is within the US Doge Service. Both are separate from the White House Office," he said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Musk is an employee of the White House Office. He is not an employee of the US Doge Service or US Doge Service Temporary Organisation. Mr Musk is not the Temporary Administrator," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fisher's filing was made in a case brought against Musk by 14 US states, including New Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint interview with Musk due to be broadcast on Fox News later on Tuesday, Trump took aim at critics saying that the Tesla founder was the one running the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me... But you know what I have learned Elon? That people are smart, they get it," Trump said in an excerpt of the interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk added: "Yeah they do actually." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An extraordinary Arab League meeting on Gaza, initially set for next week, has been postponed to March 4, host Egypt said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry said the new date was agreed with Arab League members as part of "substantive and logistical preparations" for the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting was called in response to US President Donald Trump's proposal to take over the war-battered Gaza Strip and move its Palestinian inhabitants elsewhere, including to Egypt and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia is set to host the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Friday to present their own plan for Gaza's reconstruction while ensuring that Palestinians remain on their land.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Gaza plan has sparked outcry across the Arab world, prompting a rare show of unity among Arab nations to block it. (AFP)

    HK's population grows by 6,400

<img alt="Hong Kong's population stood at 7.534 million at the end of 2024, representing an increase of 0.1 percent year on year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792151_2_20250218225030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population expanded for the third consecutive year, albeit at a slower pace, to 7.534 million last year, an uptick of 6,400.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 0.1 percent growth paled in comparison to the 0.7 percent increase in 2023, and one percent in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the 36,700 births last year were outstripped by 51,400 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offset by a net positive movement of 21,000 SAR residents, which included 40,000 arrivals through one-way permits. Around 18,900 people migrated elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said that various talent attraction measures and labour importation schemes helped boost the city's population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Social Work and Social Administration struck a cautious tone.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the natural decrease of over 14,000 people remained a concern, alongside the city's ageing population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we can see is that the ageing situation remains a very important issue and it will get worse in the coming years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip does not expect the trend to reverse any time soon, despite a 10 percent jump in the birth rate last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In 2024, that was the dragon year. It is a year that tends to have a higher birth rate than before. But I think when we look at the historical figures, all the years after the dragon years, I think the birth rates reduced accordingly," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The population expert urged the government to focus on improving people’s health and wellbeing, while encouraging enterprises to adopt technology to make work less labour intensive.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker legends Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan said they are very excited to play in their first tournament in Hong Kong since becoming SAR residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 will be held in the Kai Tak Arena on March 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Trump is set to face Gary Wilson of England, while O'Sullivan will take on Si Jiahui from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Trump and O'Sullivan obtained their Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it is more motivating to come back here because I feel like now that I'm here, and I feel like the people in Hong Kong can really get behind me and have someone to really support," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think when you have somebody that is trying to represent Hong Kong, which I am now. I think the people can kind of see that. I hope that comes off in the way that I'm able to carry myself and give everybody full respect. I hope to make Hong Kong proud and be the first winner of this tournament."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan, a seven-time World champion, said he is ready and looks forward to play in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said efforts are underway to make sure the event is being held successfully at the brand new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope the spectators will understand if something don't go right on the first day, we guarantee that we will try to our best to fix problems to make sure the tournament will run smoothly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhibition matches will also take place during the two-day event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's top player, Marco Fu, will face off the legendary "Whirlwind" Jimmy White on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Ng On-yee, meanwhile, takes on world number 1 Mink Nutcharut from Thailand the following day.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in the November-January period, unchanged from the previous three-month figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said 3,716,600 were in work in the latest period, a fall of 2,300 from October-December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour force, meanwhile, decreased by around 5,700 to 3,826,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 110,100 people were looking for a job, down about 3,500 from the previous three-month period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate also remained unchanged in the three months from November, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said Hong Kong's jobless rate remains low.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in a statement that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though uncertainties in the global economy would continue to pose challenges to some businesses."

    Lawmakers back annual minimum wage reviews

<img alt="Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 per hour. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792143_1_20250218174210.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers welcomed the shift from biennial to annual minimum wage reviews, saying this would enhance the quality of life of grassroots workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's statutory minimum wage will increase from HK$40 to HK$42.1 an hour, following a 5.25 percent recommendation from the Minimum Wage Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  This new rate is set to take effect on May 1, pending lawmakers' approval, and will be reviewed annually instead of biennially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel, said reviewing wages annually allows minimum wage workers to better pace their earnings with inflation each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK that the government's freeze on minimum wage levels during the pandemic led to four years without salary increases for grassroots workers despite inflation, severely affecting their ability to maintain their purchasing power and living standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam hopes future adjustments to the minimum wage would give greater weight to economic growth, so that workers could benefit more substantially from gains in the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that later ... after three or five years we can review the formula to see whether we can increase the proportion of the calculation of growth of the GDP so that if there's a large increase in GDP, then we can also have a large increase in minimum wage levels so that the grassroots worker can share the fruits of economic development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, said they would continue to communicate with the government to see whether a review could be conducted within five to 10 years after this reform was completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the increase was unlikely to have a major impact on the labour market, as only about 20,000 of the 3.6 million workers in the SAR earn the minimum wage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of grassroots workers is small and their roles are concentrated in cleaning and security. We have heard that many companies in these industries already pay wages above the minimum wage, meaning that this adjustment will not affect those already earning more than the minimum," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thus, we believe it will not have a major impact on the economy or competitiveness."

    Islamic finance among new additions to Talent List

<img alt="From March 1, the Talent List will cover 60 professions. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792146_1_20250218174805.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aircraft maintenance engineers, accountants and financial professionals with Islamic market experience will be among nine professions added to Hong Kong's Talent List from March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants new blood with a background in commodities trading, as well as systems architects, patent professionals, ship surveyors, professionals in green shipping, and legal knowledge engineers in the legal and dispute resolution sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a closed-door media briefing on Tuesday, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said that by expanding the number of jobs on the list to 60, the government is hoping to find talented people who can add significant value to the economy in areas where there are staff shortages and where it is not practical to train up locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, it said requests from industries to add further roles to the list, including pilots and language therapists, have been rejected because there are sufficient training opportunities for local people to take up such jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in professions on the list get a smoother immigration process when applying to work in Hong Kong through various talent schemes, officials say.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last expansion of the Talent List was in May 2023, when the number of professions rose from 13 to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said between May 2023 and the end of last year it received 1,123 applications for work visas involving jobs on the list.

 China hopes that all parties and stakeholders can participate in the peace talks to solve the Ukraine crisis, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Beijing welcomes all peace efforts over Ukraine, including the talks between the United States and Russia, ahead of a meeting between diplomats from the two countries in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a swift resolution to the three-year conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv was not invited to the discussions in Riyadh, while European leaders were gathering in Paris for emergency talks on how to respond to the radical pivot by the new US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo said: "We hope that all parties can work together to resolve the root causes of the Ukraine crisis, find a balanced, effective and sustainable security structure and achieve long-term peace and stability in Europe." (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior officials from Russia and the US met in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to begin talks on improving ties and negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegations led by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met at the Diriyah Palace in Riyadh.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting marks another pivotal step by the Trump administration to reverse Washington's policy on isolating Russia and is meant to pave the way for a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier this month upended US policy toward Ukraine and Russia by saying he and Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials aren’t taking part in the meeting, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday his country wouldn't accept the outcome if Kyiv didn't take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio was accompanied by US national security adviser Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, while Lavrov sat next to the Kremlin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan and national security adviser Musaed al Alban joined Rubio, Lavrov and others for the start of the meeting but were expected to leave early in the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ushakov said on Monday the talks would be “purely bilateral” and would not include Ukrainian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks mark a significant expansion of US-Russian contacts nearly three years into a war that has seen ties fall to the lowest level in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov and then-US Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in India nearly two years ago, and in the fall of 2022, US and Russian spymasters met in Turkey amid Washington’s concerns that Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons amid battlefield setbacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recent US diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Kyiv and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that will not be favourable to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the UK on Monday to decide how to respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Trump and Zelensky following the meeting. (AP)
