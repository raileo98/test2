<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China women’s rugby team on Tuesday said they are ready to take their game to the next level at the upcoming Rugby Sevens, to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Natasha Olson-Thorne was brimming with excitement over playing in front of the home crowd in Kai Tak Stadium, telling RTHK her team is keen to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wants to build on their success last year when they were runners-up in the Melrose Claymores competition, a tournament among Asian nations which runs alongside the showpiece Sevens event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just got to take it in," Olson-Thorne said during an open training session. "Take a deep breath and just enjoy the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pressure is something that we should enjoy, because we don't often get the chance to perform in front of our home crowd, friends, and family," she added. "So taking that and knowing they're behind us, that's a really important feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  Olson-Thorne, who made her international Sevens debut during the 2011 Hong Kong Women's Sevens, also said intense training sessions ahead of this year's competition has strengthened the bond between her teammates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been working on our physicality in the contact area, and also learning to trust ourselves and the team more," she explained. "It's brought us closer together and we're excited to showcase what we've learnt come the Hong Kong Sevens."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chloe Chan, who late last year was selected as the new co-captain of the women's side, said she hopes to encourage her teammates to play to their strengths on the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The thing about our team is that we're all so different," said Chan. "We've got speed, we've got physical players, and bigger players who can help us build that foundation in our structure. That's the one thing we know we're good at – using each other's strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added she will do what she can to lead her teammates on and off the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not a very vocal leader, so I don't really like to talk that much. But I like to think I can lead by example, so I'm hoping I can do my job the right away and build each other to do the same thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Head coach Andy Vilk, meanwhile, said he is looking forward to feeding off last year's energy, and said this year's Sevens will be a "unique experience" for his young squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think last year was a fantastic experience. It's an important experience for the players and their growth and to be able to play with that kind of pressure. We need to understand how we're going to embrace that pressure and use it to our advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vilk – who took up coaching duties just weeks before the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou – said his side will be ready to take on powerhouses Thailand and Kazakhstan in the Melrose Claymores, when the highly-anticipated three-day sporting event kicks off on March 28.

 The foreign ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will hold a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday, Seoul's foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and his Japanese and Chinese counterparts, Takeshi Iwaya and Wang Yi, will discuss cooperation since the last trilateral leaders' summit in May and exchange opinions on various topics, including the regional and international situation.

    Vaping devices ban sought to stop space oil drug use

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health on Tuesday called on the government to ban the possession of e-cigarettes devices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Henry Tong said the situation with teenagers taking the space oil drug is worrying.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said teachers and parents find it hard to spot students taking the drug, which is usually inhaled through vaping devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong noted that e-cigarettes make it easy to easy to hide abuse of the drug as, unlike with the distinctive smell of traditional cigarettes, the space oil drug offers different flavours such as fruit and chocolate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that the government should proceed with all haste in implementing the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said 300 people reportedly took the drug last year, with 75 percent of them aged below 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a greater incidence of the cases in North district, Yuen Long and Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Sing-chin, chairman of Tuen Mun District Secondary School Heads Association, said on the same show that the number of reported space oil cases in these places might be due to their higher number of students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the participation rate for the "Healthy School Programme," an anti-drug education initiative that comes with voluntary drug testing, varies among districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, while more than 90 percent of the schools in Tai Po have already signed up for the scheme, only a few schools among the dozens in other districts have done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK there might be a reason why some schools decided not to join the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that maybe for schools, anti-drug education might not be a high priority. Because actually there were only a very low number of students taking drugs. It's a minority. Therefore, teachers' time and efforts might be on education," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, we care a lot about students' mental health and emotions, and they might focus more on these areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng emphasised that rather than mainly relying on tests to tell if a student is on drug, the priority should be on teachers' observation and peer support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Chinese EV giant BYD surged to a record high on Tuesday after it unveiled new battery technology it says can charge a vehicle in the same time it takes to fill up a petrol car.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said the battery and charging system, called "Super e-Platform," boasted peak speeds of 1,000 kW, allowing cars to travel up to 470 kilometres after being plugged in for just five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new technology aims to "fundamentally solve users' charging anxiety," according to founder Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pursuit is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of fuel vehicles," he said at the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed shares in BYD jumped more than six percent to hit a fresh peak at one point on Tuesday before paring some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement positions BYD ahead of arch-rival Tesla, whose Superchargers currently offer charging speeds of 500 kW.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD introduced the Super e-Platform alongside two new EV models that will be the first to feature the system: the Han L sedan and the Tang L SUV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled plans to build more than 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations nationwide to support the new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ambitious expansion comes on the heels of remarkable growth, with February sales soaring 161 percent to more than 318,000 electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tesla experienced a steep 49 percent sales decline in the Chinese market during the same period. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday that the Legislative Council general election will be held on December 7.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said three months prior to the poll, a by-election would be held for the Election Committee tasked with nominating and electing 40 Legco members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted that of the 967 elected members in the 1,500-strong committee, there are 90 vacancies and there's a need to fill them in a by-election set for September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said electoral officials will provide more details later, such as the nomination periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have directed the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau to prepare for the elections, and collaborate closely with the Electoral Affairs Commission," Lee said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and the Electoral Affairs Commission will work on vote counting, data systems and security, among other tasks, to ensure everything goes smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco election will return 90 lawmakers for the eighth legislature since the SAR's establishment, and it's the second poll since the national legislature passed a decision to improve Hong Kong's electoral system four years ago.

    'Changes in checkpoints for drivers need coordination'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said any changes to cross-border driving arrangements must prioritise traffic management and require careful coordination with mainland authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, cross-boundary private cars are only allowed to use designated border checkpoints for entry and exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice-chairman and former chief executive CY Leung called the arrangement unreasonable, saying such vehicles should be able to use different ports to travel in and out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters the government must ensure smooth traffic flow at all checkpoints when it considers any changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One consideration that we have to take into account is that if there aren't any regulations or controls, some of the ports that provide more convenience may see serious traffic congestion and the congestion may affect the urban areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said any changes would require cooperation between local and mainland authorities since cross-border control points involve traffic management on both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2023, some private cars and cross-boundary coaches have been permitted to use different control points, Lee noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said members of his administration would continue to work with their mainland counterparts and study potential new arrangements that align with people's expectations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least seven people were killed on Monday when a small plane crashed into the sea while taking off from the Honduras Caribbean island of Roatan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major Wilmer Guerrero of the country's fire department told reporters 10 people were retrieved from the site of the crash, six of whom were pronounced dead at the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A crew member's body was then found floating in the sea near the plane, which crashed about a kilometre from the coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials gave conflicting reports on the number of people on board the plane -- either 17 or 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guerrero said one of the passengers, a 40-year-old French citizen, would be transferred to a hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lanhsa airlines plane took off at nightfall from Roatan, one of the Bay Islands, and one of Honduras' main tourist destinations, heading for the port of La Ceiba, on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plane almost fell on us. I was fishing," a fisherman told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honduran President Xiomara Castro said she had "immediately activated" an emergency committee made up of the armed forces, firefighters, and others to assist the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash was caused by an "apparent mechanical failure" on the British-made Jetstream 41, police said in a statement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said concerns expressed over CK Hutchison’s deal to sell its global port operations to a US consortium are worthy of "serious attention," saying foreign governments should provide a fair environment for deal-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment on Tuesday when asked about Beijing officials re-posting of articles criticising the deal, which also included the selling of the firm's operations at the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale came after US President Donald Trump reportedly asked the military to draw up plans to ensure American access of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said foreign governments should ensure that global trades are made in a fair manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong SAR government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that the SAR government will ensure that any transactions are made in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CK Hutchison and CK Assets announced that they will not hold press and investors briefings on Thursday, when they release annual results.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A special admission scheme that makes it easier for guests from 10 Asean nations to visit Hong Kong will start on Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee has announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Such guests include those who have made significant economic contributions to the SAR or been invited to important events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can enjoy fast immigration clearance through self-service gates and have a special counter to handle their visas and paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can stay for two or more months and enjoy these benefits for three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the move is aimed at strengthening the city's ties with Asean countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now this special scheme will facilitate the attendance of talent from Asean member states in our important meetings and facilitate their investments in Hong Kong, thus encouraging them to use Hong Kong as a springboard to go global," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asean is one of Hong Kong's closest economic partners and the city's second-largest trading partner in merchandise trade, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive said the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Department of Justice will start sending out invitations to business and legal leaders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched new strikes against Hamas on Tuesday and promised "increasing military force" after talks on further hostage releases stalled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 200 people were killed and another 150 were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed the military to take "strong action" against Hamas in Gaza in response to the group's refusal to release hostages and rejection of all ceasefire proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength," the prime minister's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month long war where dozens of hostages were released for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior Hamas official accused Israel of unilaterally overturning the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hamas said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Three houses were hit in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, a building in Gaza City, and targets in Khan Younis and Rafah, according to medics and witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab mediators, backed by the United States, haven't been able to hammer out differences between the two warring parties in talks held over the past two weeks. (Agencies)

    MMA star Conor McGregor meets Trump at White House

<img alt="Irish UFC fighter Conor McGregor stands at the briefing room lectern with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796184_1_20250318092653.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, who has been found liable of sexual assault, met Donald Trump during a Saint Patrick's Day visit on Monday during which he lashed out at illegal immigration in Ireland.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Ireland is at the cusp of potentially losing its Irishness," said McGregor during an appearance in the White House briefing room alongside the US president's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The illegal immigration racket is running ravage on the country," added the fighter, wearing a green business suit to mark Saint Patrick's Day, the centuries-old celebration of his homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later hosted the 36-year-old former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star - whom he said last week was his favourite Irishman - in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor posed for a picture with his arm around Trump's shoulder as the president sat at his desk, and for another with tech tycoon and powerful Trump advisor Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla billionaire Musk previously backed McGregor when he spoke in the past about a possible presidential bid in Ireland. Musk has recently spoken out in support of a number of anti-immigration parties in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your work ethic is inspiring," McGregor told Trump, according to footage posted by an aide to the US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yours is too, you're fantastic," replied Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor had earlier said he would be "listening" to Trump on immigration - one of the US president's main focus areas as he seeks to ramp up deportations of people without proper documentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We couldn't think of a better guest to have with us on Saint Patrick's Day," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor's comments earned swift pushback from Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, who met with Trump last week in the White House and received a dressing down over trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conor McGregor's remarks are wrong, and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland," the premier posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a sport that combines various combat techniques, and can be extremely violent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been gaining popularity, particularly as Trump campaigned in 2024 with stars and promoters of the UFC series that is popular with many male voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicknamed "The Notorious," McGregor is one of the biggest stars in UFC, the most famous and lucrative MMA league. He is known for his aggressive, provocative temperament and noted for occasional anti-immigration outbursts.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 2024 the fighter was ordered by an Irish court to pay damages to a woman who claimed that McGregor "brutally raped and battered" her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor claimed they had consensual sex.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, the Irishman was sued in a US court in January, accused of sexual assault at an NBA game in Miami in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was meanwhile ordered by a New York jury in a civil trial in 2023 to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict, which was upheld in December 2024. (AFP)

    Stranded astronauts set to return after nine months

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months aboard the International Space Station, a pair of astronauts are finally set to depart for Earth early Tuesday, ending a prolonged mission that has captivated global attention.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams flew to the orbital lab in June last year, on what was supposed to be a days-long roundtrip to test out Boeing's Starliner on its first crewed flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the spaceship developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly them back, instead returning empty without more major problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-Navy pilots Wilmore and Williams, 62 and 59 respectively, were instead re-assigned to the Nasa-SpaceX Crew-9 mission, which saw a Dragon spacecraft fly to the ISS last September with a team of two, rather than the usual four, to make room for the "stranded" pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, early Sunday, a relief team called Crew-10 docked with the station, their arrival met with broad smiles and hugs as they floated through the hatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crew-10's arrival clears the way for Wilmore and Williams to depart, along with American Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
  <br>
  <br>
  If all goes smoothly, the Dragon craft will deploy its parachutes off the coast of Florida for an ocean splashdown, where a recovery vessel will retrieve the crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams' stay surpasses the standard six-month ISS rotation but ranks only sixth among US records for single-mission duration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Challenges such as muscle and bone loss, fluid shifts, and readjusting to gravity are well understood and well managed. (AFP)

    Indonesia to repatriate hundreds of scam workers

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 500 Indonesians freed from online scam centres in Myanmar are expected to be repatriated via Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cyberscam operations, which have thrived in Myanmar's lawless border areas for several years, lure foreign workers with promises of high-paying jobs but hold them hostage and force them to commit online fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 workers from at least two dozen countries have been freed in recent weeks, the majority of them Chinese, but many have been languishing in squalid temporary holding camps on the border between Myanmar and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  400 Indonesian nationals will return home on Tuesday and around 160 are to come back on Wednesday, Judha Nugraha, the director of citizen protection at Indonesia's foreign ministry, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  They would come back on three flights from Bangkok after crossing into Thailand from Myanmar, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian authorities already repatriated 140 nationals from Myanmar via Thailand last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in Myanmar, under pressure from ally China, have cracked down on the scam compounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Indonesians have been enticed abroad in recent years to other Southeast Asian countries for better-paying jobs, only to end up in the hands of transnational scam operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 2020 and September last year, Jakarta repatriated more than 4,700 Indonesians entangled in online scam operations from countries including Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, according to foreign ministry data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations estimates that as many as 120,000 people - many of them Chinese men - may be working in Myanmar scam centres against their will. (AFP)

    Kiribati eyes deep-sea mining deal with China

<img alt="View of Kiribati's Parliament House. Kiribati opened discussions with China after a deal with Canada's The Metals Company fell through. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796176_1_20250318084916.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pacific nation Kiribati says it is exploring a deep-sea mining partnership with China, dangling access to a vast patch of Pacific Ocean harbouring coveted metals and minerals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati opened discussions with Chinese ambassador Zhou Limin after a longstanding agreement with leading deep-sea mining outfit The Metals Company fell through.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talk provides an exciting opportunity to explore potential collaboration for the sustainable exploration of the deep-ocean resources in Kiribati," the government said on Monday evening in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pacific nations Kiribati, Cook Islands and Nauru sit at the forefront of a highly contentious push to mine the depths of the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati holds rights for deep-sea mining exploration across a 75,000-square-kilometre swathe of the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through state-backed subsidiary Marawa Research, Kiribati had been working with Canada-based The Metals Company to develop the area's mineral deposits.
  <br>
  <br>
  That agreement was terminated "mutually" at the end of 2024, The Metals Company told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Metals Company said Kiribati's mining rights were "less commercially favourable than our other projects".
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm is racing to win regulatory approval that would make it one of the first companies to mine international waters on an industrial scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has partnerships with Kiribati's Pacific neighbours Nauru and Tonga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the International Seabed Authority are currently meeting in Jamaica to thrash out the rules for deep-sea extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Cook Islands struck a five-year agreement in February to cooperate in exploring the Pacific nation's seabed mineral riches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal did not include any exploration or mining licence. (AFP)

<img alt="A spokesperson for the coffee chain said the company would appeal the award. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796175_1_20250318083745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Starbucks has been ordered to pay US$50 million to a customer who was burned when hot tea spilled on his lap at a California drive-through.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for Michael Garcia said the server who handed him three super-sized drinks in February 2020 did not push one of them into the cardboard cupholder properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he took the tray, the drink tipped over, "causing third degree burns to his penis, groin, and inner thighs," according to a statement from Trial Lawyers for Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a hospitalisation and multiple skin grafts, Michael has lived for five years with the disfigurement, pain, dysfunction, and psychological harm caused by the burns."
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which specialises in no-win-no-fee claims, said Starbucks had denied responsibility for Garcia's suffering, but before a jury trial had offered to settle for US$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the coffee giant balked at the demand for a public apology and a change in policy that Garcia wanted, so the case went to trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  A jury in Los Angeles on Friday awarded him US$50 million, a figure his attorneys said would eventually cost Starbucks more than US$60 million once pre-judgement interest, costs and attorneys' fees are added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starbucks Corporation consistently denied responsibility for five years, all the way up to and through trial, and attempted to escape responsibility," the lawyers' statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trial was a perfect example of frivolous defences and victim-blaming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud of Michael for standing up for himself and having the courage to tell his story."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company would appeal the award.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We sympathise with Mr Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive," Jaci Anderson, director of corporate communications, said in a statement to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case is redolent of a 1994 landmark legal action against McDonald's in New Mexico, when 79-year-old Stella Liebeck was awarded over US$2.8 million after spilling hot coffee on herself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the award was reduced on appeal, the Liebeck case became a touchstone issue in US tort reform, and was often mocked as an example of how readily Americans resort to the law. (AFP)

 Lionel Messi will miss two World Cup qualifiers after he was left out of the Argentina squad for games against Uruguay and Brazil because he reportedly suffered an injury in a club game.
 <br>
  <br>
  After missing three games for his club, Inter Miami, at the start of March with a pulled muscle, the 37-year-old Messi returned with a goal off the bench in a Concacaf Champions Cup win. He played a full 90 minutes and scored again in an MLS win in Atlanta on Sunday but, Argentinian media reported, then felt muscle discomfort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, the defending World Cup champions, can ensure qualification for next year's tournament in their two games on the current international group.
  <br>
  <br>
  They lead the 10-team South American qualifying group by five points from Uruguay and visit Montevideo on Friday before hosting Brazil in Buenos Aires on March 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams qualify directly for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The seventh-placed team is currently Bolivia with 13 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  After 12 rounds, Messi is the top scorer in the competition with six goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina are also without injured Roma striker Paulo Dybala and River Plate full-back Paulo Montiel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil, will be without 33-year-old Neymar, who has suffered a thigh injury and has had to postpone his return to the national team, who are fifth, seven points behind Argentina. (AFP)

    Carney says Canada must reduce reliance on US

<img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks during a bilateral meeting with Britain's Prime Minister. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796162_1_20250318063858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Monday warned his country must reduce its reliance on the United States and would turn towards its "reliable" European allies instead on his first trip abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carney's transatlantic visit to British leader Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron came after US President Donald Trump suggested his country could become part of the United States and threatened its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After succeeding Justin Trudeau last week, Carney conspicuously chose key European powers France and the United Kingdom, rather than the United States, for his first trip abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with UK Prime Minister Starmer in London, Carney told journalists his country "must diversify" its trade and security ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that our trade and our security relations are too reliant on the United States. We must diversify," the former Bank of England governor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's one of the reasons for which my first visit is to Paris and London."
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining their "shared values" and "shared king", Starmer thanked Carney for his "approach to Ukraine", two days after the Canadian leader took part in a video conference on shoring up support for Kyiv hosted by his UK counterpart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's King Charles -- who is also head of state in Canada -- earlier welcomed Carney for talks at Buckingham Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's UK correspondent Gavin Grey said the king would have to play delicate balancing act between supporting Carney but also being cordial to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He [Trump] has described King Charles in very, very glowing terms... so the British are very keen to use that, they are very keen to get a trade deal with America, at least some form of a trade deal, and get that expedited," Grey explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the king at the same time wanted to make it absolutely clear, in the coded world in which the king has to live -- he can't take sides, he can't offer political advice out loud -- but he wanted to make it clear that he was very supportive of Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney had travelled to the British capital after meeting France's President Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing Canada as the "most European of non-European countries", Carney said his nation needed to boost ties with European allies like France while trying to retain positive relations with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney faces threats on three fronts: a trade war with Washington, Trump's threats to annex his country and looming elections at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's imposition of an escalating raft of import tariffs on Canadian goods has threatened to trigger a recession, and his scorn for Canadian sovereignty sent jitters through the former ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a large majority of Canadian voters reject Trump's argument that their country would be better off as the "51st state of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade war is a threat to the economy of the vast country of 41 million people, which has long enjoyed a close US partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, France and Britain are among the Nato members that have maintained strong support for Ukraine's beleaguered government and military since Russia's all-out attack in February 2022, even as Trump's US administration has pushed Kyiv to make concessions to Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  London and Paris are putting together plans for a coalition security force in Ukraine and looking for allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and France want a "solid and lasting peace, accompanied by robust guarantees that will protect Ukraine against any further Russian aggression," Macron said alongside Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is in this spirit that we will... continue to demand clear commitments from Russia," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney told Macron, who also took part in Saturday's call hosted by Starmer on Ukraine, that both nations stood for "sovereignty".
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is Canada's third-largest trading partner and France its eleventh at a time when Trump's tariffs and Canadian retaliatory measures are threatening trade with its huge southern neighbour -- destination of three-quarters of Canada's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Canada also has a "Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement" with the European Union, which includes France.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, which now likewise includes Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first speech as prime minister, Carney said: "Security is a priority for this government... as is diversifying our trading and commercial relationships, of course, with both Europe and the United Kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  On his return leg, Carney will touch down in Iqaluit in Nunavut, the Canadian territory closest to the Danish autonomous country of Greenland -- another Trump target for annexation -- to "reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty". (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose for the second straight day on Monday following better US retail sales data as markets awaited a Federal Reserve decision later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales for February showed a 0.2 percent increase from the previous month, less than the 0.7 percent expected by analysts, but a step above January's 1.2 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data was good enough to keep alive the market's momentum from Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've priced in a lot of the concerns on the trade war," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,841.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,675.12, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.3 percent at 17,808.66.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks have been in retreat in recent weeks as President Donald Trump has announced myriad trade actions, implementing some tariffs and delaying other levies in a process that has left markets guessing and generated talk of a possible recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be pressed on whether uncertainty over tariffs has dimmed the US economic outlook at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development trimmed its growth forecast for the United States, citing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, PepsiCo rose 1.8 percent after announcing it will acquire the low-sugar soda brand Poppi for about US$1.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel jumped 6.8 percent on optimism about the chip company's prospects after it last week named tech industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new chief executive. (AFP)

    IOC set to include boxing on 2028 Olympics programme

<div class="itemFullText">
 International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Thomas Bach has announced that boxing is set to be among the sports at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics after a new governing body is selected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bach said the IOC's Executive Board approved including boxing on the 2028 programme after his organisation recognised World Boxing to oversee the sport at the Olympics, ending years of divisions over the way the sport is run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision still needs to be rubber-stamped by a full IOC Session of about 100 members later this week, but that is expected to be a formality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IOC stepped in to organise the boxing tournaments at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the Paris Olympics last year after breaking with the Russian-led International Boxing Association over financial, governance and ethical concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bach had warned that boxing's national federations needed to find a new and "reliable" international partner if it wanted to be included at the 2028 Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the IOC provisionally recognised World Boxing as the body to oversee the sport at future Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very confident that the session will approve it so that all the boxers of the world then have certainty that they can participate in the Olympic Games LA 2028 if their national federation is recognised by World Boxing," Bach said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  IOC members will elect Bach's successor on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front-runners in the field of seven candidates are IOC veteran Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe and former Olympic swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe. (AFP)

    Major rallies in Yemen after deadly US strikes

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people protested in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen on Monday, the Iran-backed rebels' Al-Masirah TV showed, two days after US attacks that left dozens dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators waved placards and assault rifles, chanting "Death to America, death to Israel", at a huge protest in the capital Sanaa, while rallies were also held in Saada, Dhamar, Hodeida and Amran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demonstrations were called by the rebel group's leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital, seized by the Houthis in 2014, giant Yemeni and Palestinian flags punctuated a sea of demonstrators at Al-Sabeen Square, the site of weekly protests throughout the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yemen will never back down -- we defy the Americans, we defy the Zionists," said a man shouting slogans to the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-three people died and 98 were wounded in Saturday's US attacks on Sanaa and other areas, according to the Houthi health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump ordered the attacks following months of Houthi attacks on the vital Red Sea maritime trade route, despite a pause since Gaza's ceasefire started in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, the rebels claimed to have twice attacked a US aircraft carrier group within 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis, part of Iran's "axis of resistance" against the US and Israel, launched scores of drone and missile attacks on passing ships and Israeli territory during the Gaza war, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians. (AFP)

    McIlroy wins second Players Championship title

<img alt="The win was McIlroy's second in his career at the annual PGA Tour competiton. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796153_1_20250318053122.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy cruised to a St. Patrick's Day victory at the Players Championship after defeating J.J. Spaun in a playoff at TPC Sawgrass in Florida.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-time major champion completed the three-hole shoot-out in one over par, while Spaun's challenge wilted after a disastrous triple-bogey on the second playoff hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the third time I've won on St. Patrick's Day, so it's been a good luck charm for me," McIlroy said after sealing the second Players Championship of his career and 28th PGA Tour title overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was lucky enough to do enough to get it done, but unbelievably proud and happy to win my second Players. It's really nice," McIlroy added. "I went home last night thinking 'I should have had this.' But I went home and reset, didn't have a great night's sleep, but was lucky enough to get it done."
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy had finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with Spaun following Sunday's storm-hit final round after failing to hold on to a three-shot lead with five holes to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after returning to the course on Monday in bright, breezy conditions, there was no sign of a repeat of the late stumble by McIlroy on Sunday that had allowed Spaun to force his way into the first playoff of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy struck first on the opening playoff hole, the par-five 16th, crushing a 336-yard drive straight down the fairway before reaching the green in two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun meanwhile looked out of sorts from the get-go, finding the fairway rough off the tee before landing his second shot into the greenside bunker.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy failed to make his 33-foot eagle putt but calmly rolled in an awkward five-footer for birdie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun, whose recovery out of the bunker left him with a long, unsuccessful birdie putt, could only par.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that early wobble, things got worse for Spaun at the par-three 17th island hole, with the American plunging his tee-shot into the water behind the green.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun then missed a long 10-foot putt for double bogey and eventually finished with a triple-bogey six.
  <br>
  <br>
  While McIlroy missed his birdie chance and a 10-footer to save par, his bogey four still left him three shots clear heading to the 18th. McIlroy's tee-shot on the last went well wide of the right fairway, but Spaun was unable to exert pressure, also going wide of the fairway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players reached the green in three and missed their par putts. McIlroy coolly tapped in for bogey to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy's win marked the second title of the season for the Northern Irishman as he build towards the Masters in Augusta next month – the only major missing from his collection.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy said his early season form was a reward for the hard work he has put in over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've worked really hard – I feel like I'm a way more complete player than I was a few years ago," McIlroy told NBC. "I feel like I can play in all conditions and anything that comes my way. Really happy that I was able to get it done today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun, meanwhile, was left reflecting on a disappointing outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard not to feel discouraged a little bit, but nothing but positives," Spaun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Putting myself in contention and giving myself a chance to win in a playoff – if someone had told me that would happen at the start of the week I would totally have taken it," he added. "Hopefully I can just learn from this and get it done next time." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is investigating a gastroenteritis cluster among secondary students who participated in an exchange tour to Xiamen last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The latest cluster involves six secondary students who were part of a group of 36 teachers and students from a secondary school in the Kwun Tong district.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exchange tour took place between March 13 and 15, during which the six students started developing symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them sought medical attention in Xiamen, and none were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preliminary epidemiological investigations revealed that all six affected persons had not consumed any common food items other than the group meals and had no other common exposure history in Hong Kong prior to their departure," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hence, at this stage, the CHP could not rule out the possibility that the cases were infected by consuming contaminated food."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP is investigating the source of the outbreak and has collected stool specimens for testing, while also coordinating with mainland health authorities regarding the implicated restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said it has instructed organising institutions to stop using the affected dining venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also reminded all organisers to immediately request that restaurants serving group meals refrain from offering high-risk foods like raw foods as well as cooked shellfish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said that that all participants of the tour have returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the CHP said that three more students have developed gastroenteritis symptoms following an exchange tour to Shaoguan earlier this month, raising the total number of students and teachers affected to 55.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Monday it received three proposals for establishing the city’s third medical institution.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposals were submitted by Baptist University, Polytechnic University and the University of Science and Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said that the Task Group on New Medical School will evaluate the proposals according to the devised parameters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Task Group earlier agreed to adopt a holistic and comprehensive approach for evaluating the proposals submitted by universities from various perspectives, in accordance with the 10 key parameters set (including innovative strategic positioning, curriculum structure and assessment methodologies, and financial sustainability)," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The expert advisors and other members of the Task Group will conduct an in-depth evaluation of the proposals in their respective areas of expertise."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group added that interviews with the three universities are planned for the second quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said that the evaluation process is expected to conclude within the year, with a recommendation to the government on the proposal best suited to train medical professionals and support Hong Kong’s development as an international hub for medical training, research and innovation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said three people have been arrested for their alleged involvement in a murder case in Fo Tan on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said a 52-year-old man was attacked by two men on Lai Wo Lane. He was later certified dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police raided a residential building in Mong Kok on Monday afternoon looking for the two assailants, but no arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters later in the day, superintendent Li Muk-yik said a 76-year-old man and his 47-year-old son were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair planned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both of them have a triad background. Police believe that the victim had serious disputes with the two over money," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are also looking for a suspected lookout at the scene, who is believed to have fled to the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 28-year-old girlfriend was taken into custody for allegedly assisting offenders and misleading officers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Hong Kong's richest people, Henderson Land founder Lee Shau-kee, has died at the age of 97.
 <br>
  <br>
  The property firm announced that Lee passed away peacefully on Monday evening surrounded by his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born into a small merchant's family in Guangdong province in 1928, he moved to Hong Kong in 1948 where he built his business empire and became one of the city's property tycoons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee started his career in currency and gold trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  He became friends with prominent businessmen Kwok Tak-seng and Fung King-hey. Dubbed the "Three Musketeers", they founded Sun Hung Kai Properties in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee later left Sun Hung Kai Properties and founded Henderson Land in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson grew quickly to become one of Hong Kong's biggest developers, with a land bank currently totalling about 20 million square feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  His business empire also expanded beyond real estate, which includes Hong Kong and China Gas Company, or Towngas, and the Hong Kong Ferry Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee headed Henderson Land until 2019, when he handed over the reins to his sons Peter and Martin, as joint chairmen and managing directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Forbes, the tycoon had a net worth of about US$30 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Affectionately known as "Uncle Four" for being the fourth child in his family, Lee was also renowned for his philanthropy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through the Lee Shau Kee Foundation, he donated huge sums for scholarships as well as capital and education projects in Hong Kong and across China.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of his best-known mottos was "success isn't just about making money, but knowing how to spend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee offered his condolences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called Lee Shau-kee an outstanding business leader and entrepreneur who made significant contributions to Hong Kong's economic development, as well as its prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson Land said announcements on funeral arrangements will be made later.

 Belgium and Rwanda have announced the expulsion of each other's diplomats, as relations deteriorated over allegations about their respective roles in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kigali said it was severing diplomatic relations and giving Belgian diplomats 48 hours to leave the East African country, accusing Brussels of "using lies and manipulation to secure an unjustified hostile opinion of Rwanda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgium's foreign affairs minister Maxime Prevot said the move was "disproportionate and shows that when we disagree with Rwanda they prefer not to engage in dialogue." Brussels will reciprocate by declaring Rwandan diplomats persona non grata, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  African leaders have been trying to establish a lasting ceasefire in Congo, where the Rwandan government is accused of supporting an offensive by M23 rebels in eastern Congo. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triathletes from the SAR will try to book a spot in this year's National Games by competing in a selection race next month along Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Asia Triathlon Sprint Championships will take place on April 5 and 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will start with a swim at the Central-Wan Chai Waterfront Promenade, followed by cycling around Lung Wo Road and the IFC, before ending the running portion at Tamar Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time the SAR is hosting the Asia Championships and Mixed Relay Championships for adult athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR athlete Jason Ng said he hopes to take advantage of home turf to challenge a strong field of competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the Hong Kong team, as a generalisation, we have raced on this course for a handful of times now in the last of couple years, and I think we are beginning to know it quite well now, so I think just the experience on the course will give us a bit of an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other local athletes such as Oscar Coggins, Wong Tsz-to and Hilda Choi will be competing against international contenders from 13 Asian countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal welfare groups on Monday held talks with MTR Corporation officials as the railway company looks into allowing pets on trains.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty groups under the Animal Welfare Advocacy Alliance, together with DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, made suggestions, such as a requirement for carrier bags for pets to be used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions include allowing pets on board only during non-peak hours in the initial stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of them are concerned about odour issues. We also told the MTR officials to discuss and obtain advice from veterinarians and other professionals because they need to carry out investigations on the suitability of the ventilation system in Hong Kong," said Animal Rights And Welfare Association founder Susan Lai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, the MTRC also needs to explore the need for stronger ventilation systems within the platforms," she said, citing the importance of balancing the rights of pets and their owners on the one hand and other commuters on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  District councillor Corey Lau said regulations were also needed for pets and their owners using the trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some penalties we have suggested, not just fines but also the possibility of whether pet owners who do not follow regulations may be banned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that allowing pets on trains will be a milestone in turning Hong Kong into a pet-friendly city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the railway company said it is committed to providing safe, reliable and comfortable railway services, and will consider and balance different factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will further communicate with various stakeholders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brands including Prada have cut ties with South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun amid controversy over his relationship with actress Kim Sae-ron, who was found dead in February.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old actor who gained popularity in South Korea and China over his role in hit drama series "My Love from the Star" and "Queen of Tears" has been accused of dating Kim Sae-ron when she was underage in a YouTube expose, citing testimonies from the actress' relatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luxury fashion group Prada said it mutually decided to end its collaboration with Kim when asked in a client service chat on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinto, a South Korean cosmetic brand, also announced it was ending its advertising contract with Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have determined that there are substantial grounds rendering the fulfilment of the advertising contract unfeasible," the company said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Soo-hyun's agency Goldmedalist referred to a statement given on Friday, when it denied claims that the two were in a relationship dating back to 2015 when Kim Sae-ron was a minor. She was also managed by the agency, but her contract was not renewed in 2022; the same year that she was involved in a drunk driving incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist also said Kim Soo-hyun, who has not commented directly, had been unfairly linked to Kim Sae-ron's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim, who was 24 years old, was found dead at her home. Her career had suffered since the drunk driving incident, and local media reported that she was in debt and working part-time jobs to pay it off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist said the actress owed the company around 0.7 billion won, or HK$3.75 million, in damages and penalties as a result of the drunk driving case.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, Kim Sae-ron posted a photo of her with Kim Soo-hyun which was quickly deleted, prompting speculation that the two were a couple.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer representing the relatives of Kim Sae-ron said on Monday that the late actress had decided to post the photo in hopes of hearing back from Kim Soo-hyun. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday raided a building in Mong Kok, with sources saying the operation was linked to a murder case in Fo Tan the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 52-year-old man was killed on Sunday after he was attacked by two knife-wielding men on Lai Wo Lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers cordoned off King Hing Building at the junction of Argyle Street and Fa Yuen Street on Monday afternoon, in what's believed to be part of an investigation into the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The building reopened later in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police did not say if any arrests were made.

    Mt Fuji entry fee set for hikers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hikers attempting any of Mount Fuji's four main trails will be charged an entry fee of 4,000 yen from this summer, after local authorities passed a bill on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A record influx of foreign tourists to Japan has sparked alarm about overcrowding on the nation's highest mountain, a once-peaceful pilgrimage site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, Yamanashi region, home to Mount Fuji, introduced a 2,000 yen entry fee plus an optional donation for the active volcano's most popular hiking route, the Yoshida Trail.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cap on daily entries and online reservations were also brought in on that trail by officials concerned about safety and environmental damage on Fuji's majestic slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yoshida Trail fee will be doubled for this year's July-September climbing season, while neighbouring Shizuoka region passed a bill on Monday to also charge 4,000 yen for its three trails, which were previously free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks in part to the new restrictions, the number of climbers who tackled Mount Fuji declined to 204,316 last year, from 221,322 in 2023, environment ministry data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although climber numbers continue to be eclipsed by pre-pandemic levels, "200,000 hikers is still huge," said Natsuko Sodeyama, a Shizuoka prefecture official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no other mountain in Japan that attracts that many people in the span of just over two months. So some restrictions are necessary to ensure their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the summer hiking season many trudge up its steep, rocky slopes through the night to see the sunrise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave". It last erupted around 300 years ago. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump says he plans to speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday about ending the war in Ukraine, adding discussions are already ongoing about "dividing up certain assets" between the warring parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  US officials had expressed optimism on Sunday that a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire deal could be reached in weeks after Washington proposed a halt in fighting in the three-year war after talks in Saudi Arabia, which Kyiv accepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we'll be talking about land... we'll be talking about power plants," Trump said aboard Air Force One.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington and Kyiv's European allies are pressing Moscow to accept a halt in the fighting, but Putin has given no clear answer – instead listing a string of conditions and raising "serious questions" over the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's envoy for the conflict, Steve Witkoff, who met for several hours with Putin days ago, told CNN that he thinks "the two presidents are going to have a really good and positive discussion this week".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, he added, "really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks, maybe, and I believe that's the case".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday accused the Kremlin of not wanting to end the war. He warned that Moscow wanted to first "improve their situation on the battlefield" before agreeing to any ceasefire. (AFP)

    Philippines Senate to probe Duterte handover

<img alt="Imee Marcos is the one who set the wheels in motion for the senate probe.  Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796060_1_20250317151836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippine Senate said on Monday it will conduct a formal probe of ex-president Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and swift handover last week to the International Criminal Court, which is to try him for alleged crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first Asian former head of state charged by the ICC, stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups have said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe was initiated by Senator Imee Marcos, sister of President Ferdinand Marcos but a close friend of Duterte's eldest daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two families have had a spectacular falling out since Marcos teamed with Duterte to win an election landslide in 2022. The latter has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As chairperson of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am calling for an urgent investigation into the arrest of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, an issue that has deeply divided the nation," Imee Marcos said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is imperative to establish whether due process was followed and to ensure that his legal rights were not just upheld but protected," she said, adding: "Our sovereignty and legal processes must remain paramount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was arrested at Manila airport on March 11 after a brief trip to Hong Kong and flown to the Netherlands just hours later where he was turned over to the ICC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate has set a public hearing for Thursday and invited top police and other government officials to give evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imee Marcos has tracked a course largely independent from her brother on many issues, though she is running for re-election under the administration ticket for the May 12 midterm elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours after the arrest, she challenged the wisdom of the arrest of "poor president Duterte", warning that "this can only lead to trouble".
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, she declared: "I cannot accept what they did to [Duterte]." (AFP)

    New transit route 'needs to seamlessly link Kai Tak'

<img alt="The proposed mass transit system will connect the Kai Tak MTR Station with the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal with six stations in total. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796048_1_20250317132335.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Monday urged the government to give full play to undeveloped land along the planned elevated mass transit system in Kai Tak to connect the line "seamlessly" with buildings in the neighbourhood.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice-president and executive director of Our Hong Kong Foundation's public policy institute, also acknowledged it would be difficult to further reduce construction time, after the government said the system could be up and running three years earlier than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand there are procedures on tendering, and there will be construction time... I think it is hard to push even ahead of 2031," Ip told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities recently revised their plan on building the 3.5-kilometre system between Kai Tak MTR Station and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, with a target for the route to be in service by 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  Changes include adding one more stop and making it a six-station line, which Ip said provides an opportunity to improve the system's design.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are two [plots of] commercial land that are still to be sold at that new station area, and I urge the government to take reference on what Singapore has done on its [Light Rail Transit] system to seamlessly connect or integrate the new stations with the commercial buildings nearby," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another revision put forward by officials was to keep the system at least 20 metres away from residential properties, instead of the 10 metres initially proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to Kowloon City District Councillor Jimmy Lam, privacy concerns still linger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also urged authorities to look for ways to connect the Hong Kong Children's Hospital and the incoming New Acute Hospital with the proposed route.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials could take reference from the escalators and walkway system between Central and Mid-Levels.

<img alt="The Consumer Council says only three makeup bases that offer protection from the sun do not contain potential endocrine disruptors. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796050_1_20250317133301.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that some makeup bases can affect hormone levels, and people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should avoid such products.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the 37 primers it reviewed, 17 of them that claimed to offer protection against ultraviolet rays contained potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog pointed out that aside from pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding, adolescents and children should also avoid using these products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Potential endocrine disruptors] will affect your hormone levels, your sex hormones, maybe possibly it will impair your fertility," the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for newborns, it may [cause] genital malformation; for the young adolescents, possibly premature puberty as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found that only products that protect users from the sun made by Guerlain, Hourglass, and MAC are free from potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also noted that 15 products it examined contained BHT, a type of antioxidant that helps to improve product stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the substance could potentially lead to skin and eye irritation, according to studies conducted on animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the watchdog called on the public to be aware of alcohol concentrations and fragrance allergens in cosmetics, as they could lead to dryness and irritation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Users should test products by applying them on the inner wrist, it added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Innovation and technology secretary Sun Dong said on Monday Hong Kong's I&T development was so rapid that the sector is already "in the fast lane."
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment in Beijing at a press conference on Monday about the upcoming two-day World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Wan Chai starting on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will mark the first time the summit is held outside mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the hosting of the summit in Hong Kong shows that the SAR is, apart from being a hub for finance, trading and aviation, also making the mark in becoming a centre for global IT cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, for the future innovation and technology industry, Hong Kong has entered the fast lane. We have clearly stated that there is a need to focus on several advantageous areas, and they're related to digital economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that in Hong Kong's IT development policy blueprint, areas such as artificial intelligence, data and robots have been earmarked as focal points for development.
  <br>

  For his part, the conference's secretary general, Ren Xianliang, says the summit will discuss topics such as the development of AI models, lower costs and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the introduction of AI model DeepSeek in January as changing the world's understanding of AI, saying it has provided different professions with unprecedented development momentum and room for creativity.

 A specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology said it remains uncertain whether patients will return for tailored counselling after storing their embryos or gametes for a certain period of time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is looking to make it a requirement for licensed centres under its proposal to lift the storage period restriction for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview broadcast on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>

  </a>
  ,
  <br>
  Dr Alice Wong, a council member of the Hong Kong Society for Reproductive Medicine, pointed out that present freezing technique allows embryos and gametes to be stored longer than the current limit of a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Theoretically, with our present freezing technique we can freeze the embryos and eggs for much longer than 10 years... of course the problem is whether it is feasible for the woman to bear the pregnancy 17 years after [she freezes her eggs] so there are still other limitations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the changes possible in the future, Wong believes people will consider freezing the embryos or gametes at an earlier age to harvest eggs with higher quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said this means that patients can undergo fewer harvest and thus, save money from carrying out the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments, the government is also planing to make it mandatory for centres to provide patients information such as the risks of egg retrieval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who's also the Vice President of the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Hong Kong, pointed out that centres have already been doing so.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic women's badminton champion An Se-young came from behind to beat China's Wang Zhiyi 13-21, 21-18, 21-18 in a classic All England Open final as top seed Shi Yuqi lifted the men's crown.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Wang won the first game convincingly on Sunday and edged into a 13-10 lead during a captivating second game in Birmingham but the South Korean 2023 champion pegged her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang scented victory when the scores were tied at 18-18 in the second game but her South Korean opponent took the next three points to level the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decider was also a tight affair but again An, 23, pulled away when the players were level at 18-18, winning her fourth tournament in a row and second at the All England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had all sorts of emotions going through my mind during the second game," said An. "The thought that was concrete in my mind was not giving up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That thought motivated me to keep playing and I think that led to today's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't even try to describe how hard today's match was. The match didn't go as I'd planned, which made me extra tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'm pleased with the outcome of the match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, China's men's world number one Shi delivered a composed performance to see off Lee Chia-hao of Chinese Taipei 21-17, 21-19, also collecting his second All England crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, ranked 22nd, was quickly out of the blocks and opened up a three-point lead, but Shi reeled off six straight points to lead 9-6 and never relinquished his advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tenacious Lee held a 10-9 lead in the second game but he could not pull away from his 29-year-old opponent, who also won the tournament in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shi was briefly made to sweat after his 20-16 lead narrowed to 20-19 but he held his nerve to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been seven years," said Shi. "A lot has happened during these seven years, ups and downs. I've been to a few semi-finals and didn't make it in the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After these seven years I'm delighted I could win it again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great that I can pass on some positive energy and values to the fans and in return they offer me support and encouragement." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local education concern group on Monday welcomed the government's decision to form a task force to look into a recent gastroenteritis outbreak among students who went on a mainland study tour in Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education minister Christine Choi said the task force would review the arrangements of such trips, and liaise with their mainland counterparts.

  </a>
  , Mervyn Cheung, who chairs the Hong Kong Education Policy Concern Organisation, said the task force was necessary to ensure future school trips did not encounter similar problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The task force is badly needed... because these kinds of exchanges or study tours for students are becoming more and more frequent and, at the same time, they are quite important in the curriculum for schools," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said the task force must look at existing regulations to see if they need to be changed or improved to ensure the health and safety of students on school trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They need to review all the guidelines that are set for these kinds of study tours. And especially in relation to the vigilant maintenance of hygiene and safety standards for students during the tours... whether or not the existing provisions have already safeguarded the hygienic standards and the safety standards of the travel agencies that have been hired... all this should come under very strict scrutiny."

    Healthcare co-payment levels 'should be capped'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former senior Hospital Authority official has called for caution in setting co-payment levels for healthcare services after the government said it'll consider charging patients separately for certain check-ups.
 <br>
  <br>
  Luk Che-chung, a former chief executive of the authority's Hong Kong East Cluster, also said on Monday that the authorities should cap medical expenses paid by patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some medical services do cost a lot, especially self-financed items that often involve new drugs. They are expensive. If patients need financial assistance... there'll be procedures to undergo and thresholds to meet," Luk told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is a capping mechanism in the future – not only on the number of check-ups but also medical fees – I believe it will be a good thing for the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration has said it's reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, including charging for such services as CT scans and MRIs to prevent abuse. But emergency and hospitalised patients would be exempted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they were hoping to adjust hospital fees to a level where there would be a "reasonable co-payment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Lam, chairman of Hong Kong Patients' Voices, expressed concerns that some people might not be able to cope if a co-payment were to be introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For people who are not eligible for the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme or are not qualified as a result of means tests, they would rather not pay the several hundred or thousand dollars out of their own pocket even if it means they won't receive such services. In the end, their condition may get worse," Lam told the same programme.

    Nap on beds before purchasing: consumer watchdog
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday encouraged people to nap on mattresses – some of which were found to provide inadequate support – before making a purchase.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog made the advice after testing double mattresses from 14 brands that make pocket spring, interlocking spring, and foam models.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found one was too hard and could not conform to a person’s back, and more than half of them were unable to support side-sleepers effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council's chief executive Gilly Wong said taking a trial nap on mattresses at stores could help people make smarter purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We highly recommend don't be shy. [Do] try out different mattresses to test out how you feel after you sleep on it. We recommend at least ten to 15 minutes. Frankly speaking, the longer the better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if the shop allows you to sleep longer, sleep as long as you could so that you can get a good sense according to your sleeping pattern, no matter it's back sleeping or side sleeping," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also revealed that pocket spring mattresses offered more stability than interlocking spring models, allowing two people to rest with fewer disturbances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Choose [mattresses] according to your own and partner’s body shape, sleeping habits and posture," the council's report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also noted that prices do not necessarily reflect the quality of the mattress, as they found a more than double price difference for two pocket spring models of the same rating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the watchdog reminded consumers to pay attention to their mattresses' warranty terms, after finding over half of them were eligible for free maintenance for the first one or two years of purchase.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged sellers to clearly explain any post-purchase costs and warranty registration procedures.

    China retail sales up four percent

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in China accelerated slightly in the first two months of the year, government data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) offered some positive signs, showing retail sales – a key measure of consumer sentiment – increased four percent year-on-year during January and February combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS said total retail sales of consumer goods reached over 8.37 trillion yuan for the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales climbed by 3.7 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, in the first two months, with the sustained effects of macro policies, the national economy maintained the new and positive development," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, the statement warned "domestic effective demand is weak, [and] some enterprises face difficulties in production and operation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production in January and February increased 5.9 percent year-on-year, data showed, slowing from the 6.2 percent growth in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statistics authorities combine many economic indicators for the first two months of the year to account for potential distortions caused by the annual Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the surveyed urban unemployment rate – China's main metric for measuring unemployment – in February ticked up to 5.4 percent, the NBS said, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing announced earlier this month that it is targeting GDP growth of five percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with an intensified trade war under US President Donald Trump, the nation’s officials are looking to boost domestic consumption to reduce reliance on exports.  (AFP/Xinhua)

    Mass layoffs begin at Voice of America

<img alt="Contractual staff at Voice of America have been told they are terminated as of this end of this month. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796015_1_20250317104956.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration began mass layoffs at Voice of America and other US-funded media, making clear its intent to gut outlets long seen as critical for US influence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just a day after all employees were put on leave, staff working on a contractual basis received an email notifying them that they were terminated at the end of this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors were told that "you must cease all work immediately and are not permitted to access any agency buildings or systems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractors make up much of VOA's workforce and dominate staffing in the non-English language services, although recent figures were not immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many contractors are not US citizens, meaning they likely depend on their soon-to-disappear jobs for visas to stay in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Full-time VOA staff, who have more legal protections, were not immediately terminated but remain on administrative leave and have been told not to work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voice of America, created during World War II, broadcast around the world in 49 languages with a mission to reach countries deemed to be without media freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order on Friday targeting VOA's parent US Agency for Global Media in his latest sweeping cuts to the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency had 3,384 employees in the 2023 fiscal year. It had requested US$950 million for the current fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With VOA in limbo, some of its services have switched to playing music for lack of new programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sweeping cuts also froze Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, formed in the Cold War to reach the former Soviet bloc, and Radio Free Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other US-funded outlets being gutted include Radio Farda, a Persian-language broadcaster blocked by Iran's government, and Alhurra, an Arabic-language network established after the Iraq invasion in the face of highly critical coverage by Qatar-based Al-Jazeera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said on Saturday that "taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump regularly criticizes media coverage of him and has questioned the wisdom of funding VOA when it has a "firewall" ensuring its editorial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial on the demise of VOA, China's Global Times tabloid said that "the monopoly of information held by some traditional Western media is being shattered."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multidimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughingstock of the times," it said. (AFP)

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 266.02 points, or 1.11 percent, to open at 24,226 points on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as official data shows China's retail sales of consumer goods - a major indicator of the country's consumption strength - climbed 4 percent year-on-year in the first two months of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the National Bureau of Statistics also showed that China's value-added industrial output, an important economic indicator, went up 5.9 percent on-year in the same period. (Xinhua)

    'Action plan to stabilise stock, property markets'

<img alt="Central authorities have said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796002_1_20250317095840.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland officials on Monday said a special action plan to boost consumption,will, for the first time, put an emphasis on the need to stabilise both the stock and property markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Xinhua News Agency said that the action plan – organised into eight sections – aims to promote reasonable wage growth by strengthening employment support in response to economic conditions and to grow incomes through property reform, including in rural areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The plan puts an emphasis on stabilising the stock and property markets, and proposes corresponding measures in a bid to make people feel more confident about consuming, with more stable expectations,” a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, Li Chunlin, told reporters at a press conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said officials have sought to strengthen demand-side policies to stimulate consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, the plan proposes to promote the reasonable growth of wages. This includes supporting enterprises to stabilise employment, and supporting workers to improve their skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We want to] scientifically and reasonably raise the minimum wage, so that the minimum wage standard can be adjusted on time and in a steady manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mechanisms for stabilising the stock market and the development of financial products for individual investors are also being explored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the plan, financial institutions will be encouraged to issue more personal consumption loans and set reasonable loan limits, terms and interest rates, Xinhua said, adding there are proposals to linking consumer consumption to broader social goals, and potentially raising pension benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also pointed out that the central government has doubled to 300 billion yuan the "ultra-long bonds" earmarked for subsidising the public's replacement of goods such as mobile electronic devices, electric cars and electronic home appliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's plan also includes proposals to formulate a childcare subsidy scheme, implement paid annual leave for workers, boost healthcare protection for the elderly, along with other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, official data showed on Monday that new home prices on the mainland dropped 0.1 percent in February. On a year-on-year basis, new home prices fell 4.8 percent, compared with a five percent drop the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its annual work report earlier this month, the central government said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year. China will also introduce city-specific policies for adjusting homebuying curbs and tap into the potential demand for first homes and better housing, policymakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is pushing for economic growth of around five percent this year, Premier Li Qiang announced at the opening session of the National People's Congress earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new plan is part of China's drive to make domestic demand the main engine and anchor of its economic growth.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unusually vicious and damaging weather across multiple US states spawned violent tornadoes, blinding dust storms and fast-moving wildfires this weekend, leaving at least 37 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hailey Hart and her fiancé Steve Romero hunkered down with their three huskies inside their 1994 Toyota Celica as a tornado ripped apart their home Saturday in Tylertown, Mississippi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romero said he prayed out loud and hugged Hart as the car rolled onto its side, windows shattering, before it landed on its wheels again. After the twister passed, they could hear people nearby screaming for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was a bad dream come true,” Romero said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next door, Hart’s grandparents crawled out from the rubble of their destroyed house after they sought shelter in a bathroom as falling trees collapsed the roof.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Everything was coming down on us,” said Donna Blansett, Hart’s grandmother. “All I could do was pray to God to save us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  They escaped with just a few scratches and aches. Family members, friends and volunteers spent Sunday removing debris and salvaging anything they could find - some damp clothes, a photo album and a few toiletries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so happy you’re alive,” Hart said through tears, as she embraced her grandmother on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service said tornado watches had mostly expired, but dangerous winds were still possible in the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida through Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dynamic storm that began Friday earned an unusual “high risk” designation from weather forecasters. Still, experts said it was not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three people, including an 82-year-old woman, were killed in central Alabama when multiple tornadoes swept across the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Troy, Alabama, parks officials said the recreation centre where many residents had taken refuge had to be closed due to damage from overnight storms. No one was injured.
  <br>

   <br>
   Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbours found five bodies scattered in rubble on Friday night outside what remained of his aunt’s house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said.

    <br>
    In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves announced that six people died and more than 200 were displaced after tornadoes sowed devastation across three counties. And in the northern part of the state, roads were inundated and some people were stranded by flood waters.
    <br>
    <br>
    Wind-driven wildfires caused extensive damage in Texas and Oklahoma and officials warned on Sunday that parts of both states would again face an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week.
    <br>
    <br>
    More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, Governor Kevin Stitt said.
    <br>
    <br>
    Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management spokesperson Keli Cain said two people were killed as a result of wildfires and weather.
    <br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, dust storms spurred by high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday.
    <br>
    <br>
    Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle. (AP)

    Stranded astronauts to return to Earth on Tuesday

<img alt="A Nasa livestream shows the SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft approaching the International Space Station on Saturday, before docking a day later.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of US astronauts stuck for more than nine months on the International Space Station will be returned to Earth on Tuesday evening, Nasa said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are to be transported home with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the ISS early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stranded duo have been on the ISS since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said in a statement on Sunday evening that it had moved forward the astronauts' anticipated ocean splashdown off the Florida coast to Tuesday evening. It was initially slated for no sooner than Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favourable weather conditions expected for later in the week," the space agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also return on the Dragon capsule, with the journey to be broadcast live from Monday evening when hatch closure preparations begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Wilmore and Williams, it will mark the end of an ordeal that has seen them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their prolonged stay was significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russia's Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station. (AFP)

    UK finance minister to unveil plan to cut red tape

<img alt="Regulators will be summoned to Downing Street to hear Rachel Reeves' action plan to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795990_1_20250317085014.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's Labour government will on Monday set out details of how it plans to slash red tape to boost business, as it struggles to deliver growth nine months after winning power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chancellor Rachel Reeves' shake-up comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer took aim at the nation's "flabby state", sparking anger from unions who called on him to avoid the "incendiary rhetoric" of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry said regulators would be summoned to the prime minister's Downing Street office on Monday to hear Reeves announce her "action plan to deliver on the pledge to cut the administrative cost of regulation on business by a quarter".
  <br>
  <br>
  The "radical" plan would cut "costly red tape" such as the "hundreds of pages of guidance on protecting bat habitats which goes far beyond legal requirements", said a statement, referring to the £100 million (US$130 million) spent on a bat tunnel by the company building Britain's new high-speed HS2 train line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel has become a lightning rod for criticism of the planning system, with the Prime Minister describing it as "absurd".
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of regulators will also be cut under Reeves' plan, saving businesses "billions of pounds", the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer on Thursday announced that he was axing NHS England which has run the state-run National Health Service in that nation since 2012, in a move seen as a dramatic shift to the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has dubbed NHS England "the world's largest quango" (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation).
  <br>
  <br>
  Its abolition was the "beginning not the end" and more health-related quangos would also face the chop, Health Secretary Wes Streeting wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour ousted former prime minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative government in a landslide election victory last July but has seen its popularity ratings fall during a bumpy start.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is under pressure to deliver on its election promise to kickstart economic growth while keeping prices under control amid a prolonged cost of living crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank in February slashed its forecast for UK economic growth and warned that inflation would rise more than expected this year, blaming global risks amid US tariff threats and deteriorating business confidence in the UK. (AFP)

<img alt="Draper will make his top ten debut at seventh in the world after the victory at Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795988_1_20250317081126.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Jack Draper roared past Denmark's Holger Rune 6-2, 6-2 to win his first ATP Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 14th-ranked Briton, who toppled two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals, didn't face a break point as he subdued the 13th ranked Dane in just 69 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll make his top 10 debut on Monday at seventh in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's incredible," said Draper, a US Open semi-finalist last year whose preparations for 2025 were hindered by a flare-up of hip tendinitis. "I'm just so grateful and happy to be out here, to be able to play, my body feeling healthy, to feel great in my mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the work I've done over the last few years, it feels like it's all coming together on the big stage and I can't put that into words," added the 23-year-old, who also missed significant time with a shoulder injury in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper was rock-solid in his first Masters 1000 final, racing to a 4-0 lead as Rune made a nervous start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper dropped just four points on serve in the opening set as Rune, who burst on the scene with a precocious Paris Masters triumph in 2022, had 10 of his 19 unforced errors in the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dane had managed to hold serve twice before Draper pocketed the set, giving himself set point with an ace before Rune thumped a backhand into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper broke Rune to open the second set, and even though the Dane got a few more looks at Draper's second serve he couldn't take advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper seized a second break for a 5-2 lead and after sending a forehand long on his first match point he had the win when Rune went long with a backhand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper's run to a third career title included victories not only over Alcaraz but also over 2022 Indian Wells winner Taylor Fritz and big-hitting home hope Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like I deserve it, in all honesty," Draper said. "It's an emotional feeling to know how much you've gone through and put in and to be here now to say that I'm going to be number seven in the world tomorrow, I can't tell you how much that means to me." (AFP)

 Australian sprinting prodigy Gout Gout ran the fastest men's 200m in the world this year, with the 17-year-old saying he felt "literally free".
 <br>
  <br>
  The youngster rose to prominence in December when he clocked the quickest time ever by a 16-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  That mark broke Usain Bolt's personal best at the same age, with his 20.04secs also bettering Peter Norman's Australian record of 20.06 from the 1968 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He turned heads again on Sunday with a 20.05 in the heats of the Queensland State Championships – the fastest in the world this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gout then smashed through the 20-second barrier in the final with a 19.98, but it was wind-assisted so deemed illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt literally free. I had 80 metres left to go, and I thought, let's send it," he said of the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only from then did I believe I had a chance of going sub (20)," he added. "Seeing the clock, I was really happy and surprised in a way, but it just felt like a weight off my shoulders. Now that I've done it, I've just got to do that more consistently."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lanky Gout, who was born in Australia after his parents migrated from South Sudan, has drawn comparisons with eight-time Olympic gold medallist Bolt.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics President Sebastian Coe recently said he was a rare talent but needed "nurturing and protecting".
  <br>
  <br>
  The qualifying mark for this year's World Athletics Championships in Tokyo is 20.16, which Gout has now beaten twice. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paolo Banchero scored 24 points as the Orlando Magic overturned a 13-point deficit to end the Cleveland Cavaliers' 16-game unbeaten streak with a gutsy 108-103 road victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland, the runaway Eastern Conference leaders, had looked poised to extend their franchise-record winning run after surging clear of Orlando early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after a season where they have staged hefty winning comebacks of their own, the tables turned on Cleveland in the face of a furious burst of Orlando scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic outscored Cleveland 35-23 in the third quarter, with Franz Wagner leading the charge with nine points and Banchero adding seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Cleveland led by a slender 83-82 margin heading into the fourth quarter, and threatened to stretch away once more after Donovan Mitchell's driving layup made it 91-84, Orlando refused to roll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight more points from Wagner in the final frame and five apiece from Banchero and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope saw the Magic home to silence a 19,432 sellout crowd at Cleveland's Rocket Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former number one NBA Draft pick Banchero finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists while Wagner added 22 points with eight rebounds and two assists as Orlando improved to 32-37 to remain eighth in the Eastern Conference standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led the Cleveland scoring with 23 points, with Jarrett Allen finishing on 20 and Darius Garland adding 19. (AFP)

<img alt="Russia's Mirra Andreeva celebrates after defeating Aryna Sabalenka at the Indian Wells tournament. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795977_1_20250317054052.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva toppled world number one Aryna Sabalenka 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 to capture her second WTA 1000 title at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, who last month become the youngest ever player to win an elite 1000 level crown with her triumph in Dubai, ended a frustrating run against the Belarusian to ensure she will rise to a career-high sixth in the world on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva shook off her first set problems and broke Sabalenka three times in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a match of swinging shifts of momentum, Andreeva was in full control by the end, giving herself a match point on Sabalenka's serve with a defensive lob that forced a miss from the number one and clinching victory with a forehand winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank myself for fighting to the end," Andreeva said. "I was running like a rabbit today because Aryna she was sending bullets and it was really hard to keep up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva claimed her first hard court victory over Sabalenka, who had beaten her twice already this year at Brisbane and the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka had powered into the final without dropping a set but it was another disappointment for the Belarusian, who was stunned by Madison Keys in the final at Melbourne to see her bid for a third successive Australian Open title denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva had Sabalenka under pressure early, and the youngster's frustration was evident as she was unable to convert four break points in the third game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka took full advantage, breaking the Russian to love for a 3-1 lead and keeping her foot firmly on the accelerator from there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka backed up her power from the baseline with some confident forays to the net, breaking Andreeva to take the opening set in 37 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka fought off another three break points to open the second set, but Andreeva finally gained a foothold with a break for 2-1, pouncing on a Sabalenka second serve to end a run of 18 missed break point chances against the Belarusian this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva followed with a quick hold for 3-1 and suddenly it was Sabalenka who looked lost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva saved a pair of break points to push her lead to 4-2, her winners tally climbing with her confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After missing one chance to take the set on Sabalenka's serve, Andreeva sealed the set with her first love service game, complete with a pair of aces to close it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian maintained her momentum as she broke Sabalenka to love to open the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka promptly broke back, but that proved just a speedbump as Andreeva broke again for 2-1 and didn't face another break point on the way to her first career win over a reigning number one. (AFP)

    Newcastle win the League Cup, stunning Liverpool

<img alt="Newcastle United players celebrate after the final whistle. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795975_1_20250317053653.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle ended their 56-year trophy drought in stunning style as Dan Burn and Alexander Isak sealed a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side made history at Wembley with a superb display that left the runaway Premier League leaders shell-shocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn put Newcastle ahead late in the first half and Isak's 27th goal in all competitions doubled their lead after the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federico Chiesa got one back in the closing seconds, but Newcastle held on for their first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  That success in the predecessor to the Europa League is a relic of a bygone era, but this long-awaited triumph will be forever etched in the memories of the Newcastle fans who turned one half of Wembley into a roiling sea of black and white with their ecstatic celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also Newcastle's first major domestic prize dating back 70 years to the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the Magpies lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 30 different English teams had won silverware, while Liverpool had clinched 38 major trophies in that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after losing the 2023 League Cup final against Manchester United, Howe's team returned to Wembley and set the record straight at last.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were well aware of the history and we wanted to do the club proud. We wanted to score, we wanted to perform and we wanted to win," Howe said. "We are breaking new ground. I thought we were magnificent today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle had endured five relegations to the second tier since their last trophy, with club legends like Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Malcolm MacDonald failing to win silverware in their time on Tyneside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aside from a brief period when Kevin Keegan's self-styled "entertainers" challenged for the title in the 1990s, Newcastle have endured decades of underachievement and self-inflicted wounds that rendered them a laughing stock for long periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  All that changed in 2021 when a Saudi-backed consortium completed a takeover from unpopular owner Mike Ashley and quickly hired Howe as their manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to Howe's astute leadership and the Saudi financial backing, Newcastle have been transformed from relegation candidates to silverware winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was another painful blow for Liverpool just days after their Champions League last 16 exit on penalties against Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite failing to win their first trophy under boss Arne Slot, Liverpool still sit 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, within touching distance of a record-equalling 20th English title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very disappointing result. The game went the way Newcastle wanted it. They deserved to win. We were out-played in their style. They won more aerial duels than us," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are 23 points ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle in the league and hadn't lost to them for 17 games dating back to 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Howe's men were in no mood to be cowed by past failures
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle fans unveiled a banner before kick-off urging their team to "write your name in the history books".
  <br>
  <br>
  They rose to the challenge in spectacular fashion, snapping into tackles and counter-attacking with purpose, while Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy in possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle's desire and drive was clear to see when Joelinton tracked back from midfield to stop Jarell Quansah in his tracks and celebrated with a fist-pumping roar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite nearly being caught out by Burn's aerial prowess earlier in the game, Liverpool failed to heed the warning as the towering centre-back put Newcastle ahead in the 45th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bizarrely left unmarked, with only the diminutive Alex Mac Allister anywhere near him, Burn was allowed to rise unchallenged to meet Kieran Tripper's corner as he thumped a powerful header into far corner from 12 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn's goal – Newcastle's first in a cup final since 1976 – capped an incredible week for the journeyman centre-back, who received his first England call-up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah completely anonymous, the lethargic Reds had no answer as Isak put Newcastle into dreamland after 52 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle dominated in the air again as Jacob Murphy met Tino Livramento's cross with a header that found Isak, who drilled a superb first-time finish past Caoimhin Kelleher from 10 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiesa's stoppage-time strike set up an anxious finale, but good things comes to those who wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  And all across Wembley, Newcastle players and fans celebrated with abandon as a party over half a century in the making got into full swing. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's challenge for a place in next season's Champions League faltered in a toothless 1-0 defeat at Arsenal, as Manchester United continued their upward trend with a 3-0 win at Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino scored the only goal of a disappointing contest at the Emirates as Arsenal pulled clear in second place and to within 12 points of runaway leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea badly missed the presence of the absent Cole Palmer due to injury as they meekly surrendered to a damaging defeat for their hopes of a top-four finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues remain in fourth for now but have five sides from fifth-placed Manchester City to Aston Villa in ninth within four points of Enzo Maresca's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both managers are hoping to be stronger after the upcoming international break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka is nearing a return for Arsenal, while Maresca is confident of having Palmer, Nico Jackson and Noni Madueke back when they are next in action at home to Tottenham on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did enough to deserve to win the game," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. "Now we have the international break so let's take a chance to breathe and bring some players back hopefully."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have struggled badly for goals since the loss of Kai Havertz to a season-ending injury forced midfielder Merino into a makeshift centre-forward role.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish international proved the match winner from a corner as he looped a header from Martin Odegaard's delivery inside the far post on 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's Robert Sánchez made a brilliant stop to prevent Merino doubling Arsenal's lead with the best effort of the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the game petered out with little goalmouth action as a limp performance will do little to quieten the critics of Maresca's style of play among the Chelsea support.
  <br>
  <br>
  United extended their unbeaten run in open play to seven games with a comfortable victory at seemingly doomed Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus Hojlund ended a 21-game goal drought by firing United in front on 28 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho was made to wait for his first goal since November as the Argentine was flagged offside early in the second half. Garnacho, though, was not to be denied with a snap shot that Mads Hermansen should have kept out.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have won all four meetings against Leicester this season, two of which the Foxes' current boss Ruud van Nistelrooy was in interim charge of the Red Devils.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Dutchman has not had the same impact at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester have lost 13 of their last 14 league games to fall nine points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy's men also set an unwanted record of becoming the first Premier League side to go seven home games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes unsurprisingly set the seal on United's win with a stunning strike from the edge of the box for his seventh goal in seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham kept their season alive by reaching the Europa League quarter-finals with victory over AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, but suffered the latest in a series of European hangovers in a 2-0 defeat at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ange Postecoglou's side have won just three times in the 10 league matches that have followed a midweek European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a difficult campaign for sure," said Spurs captain Son Heung-min. "But I feel we've lost too many games that we should have got stuff out of, and this was one of those games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory for Fulham propels Marco Silva's men into the race for Champions League places as they climb to eighth, four points off the top four and three outside the top five.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five finish will almost certainly secure a place in Europe's top club competition next season thanks to the strong performance of English sides in European competitions. (AFP)

    Hospitalised Pope Francis addresses frailty

<img alt="Children holding balloons gather by the statue of John Paul II outside the Gemelli University Hospital where Pope Francis is hospitalised, in Rome. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795960_1_20250316215620.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis acknowledged being fragile and "facing a period of trial", as he thanked well-wishers on Sunday for prayers in a message from hospital, where he has been slowly recovering from pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pope, who has weathered his setbacks along with periods of improvement since being hospitalised on February 14, sent a particularly personal message to the faithful that referenced both his faith and his frailty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sharing these thoughts with you while I am facing a period of trial, and I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me," wrote the pope in the message published by the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope," he added in the message marking the second Sunday of Lent, a 40-day period of prayer and reflection leading up to Easter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday was the fifth time in a row the pope's illness had prevented him from personally giving the Angelus prayer, usually delivered to a crowd gathered in St Peter's Square following mass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Francis has yet to appear at the window of his papal suite on the 10th floor of the Gemelli hospital, that has not dissuaded a steady stream of well-wishers from gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, dozens of children including scouts from a Catholic group stood at the foot of a statue of Pope John Paul II at the hospital's entrance, holding yellow and white balloons and vainly striving to catch a glimpse of the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You see the pope there!" shouted one of them eagerly, before being set straight by the group leader, Valerio Santobonio, 23: "I don't think that's him."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday we had some drawings made specifically to give to the Holy Father," Santobonio told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the boys and girls, aged from five to seven, don't quite yet grasp who the pope is, nor his health situation, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite not appearing at the window to wave, Francis addressed his youngest well-wishers in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to 'Gemelli' as a sign of closeness," Francis wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week the Vatican signalled that the Argentine Jesuit was out of danger after a series of breathing crises earlier in his hospitalisation had sparked fears for his life.
  <br>

  On Saturday, the Vatican said Francis's condition continued to be stable and showing progress, as it has for the past week, but cautioned he still needed therapies administered within the hospital setting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy; these therapies, at present, are showing further, gradual improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That message appeared to quash speculation that the pope's progress could signal an imminent release from hospital. (AFP)

 The first US strikes against Yemen's Houthis since Donald Trump took office killed 31 people, the rebels said on Sunday, with the US president warning "hell will rain down upon" the Iran-backed group if it did not stop attacking shipping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis, who have attacked Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, said children were among those killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attacks on Sanaa, as well as on areas in Saada, Al-Bayda and Radaa, killed at least 31 people and wounded 101, "most of whom were children and women", Houthi health ministry spokesperson Anis Al-Asbahi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage on Houthi media showed children and a woman among those being treated in a hospital emergency room, including a dazed girl with blackened legs wrapped in bandages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a post on social media, vowed to "use overwhelming lethal force" to end the Houthi attacks, which the rebels say are in solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After halting their attacks when a ceasefire took effect in Gaza in January, the Houthis announced on Tuesday that they would resume them until Israel lifted its blockade of aid to the devastated Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late on Saturday, a plume of white smoke had risen over Sanaa after explosions rocked the northern district of the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Houthis sealed off areas around the blast sites, making it impossible to gauge the true scale of the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammad Albasha, a US-based consultant, said the area targeted in Sanaa was home to senior Houthi leaders and considered their stronghold in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the point of no return, and from now on, it's gloves off between the Houthis and CENTCOM," he said, referring to the regional US military command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amal, 29, who lives with her mother in Sanaa, said Saturday's attacks were "terrifying... windows were shattered and the walls of the house shook".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Several military operations against the Houthis have been announced, but they've only added more casualties, most of them civilians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The homes and locations of the leaders are well-known, but the victims are always civilians." (AFP)
