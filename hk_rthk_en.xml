    'No bid splitting for the govt's Youth Post hostel'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said it does not plan to split the bidding for its proposed youth hostel and cultural exchanges facility, saying that could contradict its aim of fostering exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee had announced in his Policy Address that authorities would convert the existing Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into the Youth Post, where young people coming from outside Hong Kong would stay and interact with locals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak told an RTHK programme that bid splitting is not cost effective and will also contradict the government's aim of setting up the place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our bidding direction is that the operator has to have relevant experience. It doesn't have to be in charge of the whole venue, which is so big, because there are a lot of different areas," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can look for groups or organisations to manage this place together. But if we were to split the bidding, it would actually restrict the operator's plan on how to use this facility."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities hope to begin the bidding process by the end of this year, and open the facility in 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And with officials already drafting the tender for the bidding, Mak emphasised that the operator has to be financially independent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The operator has to consider how it is going to operate the site. They have to be financially autonomous. The government won't invest anymore. The government might also consider charging for rent – I believe the plot of land won't be given for free. The operator has to consider how to manage their losses and gains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As for improving the transport network in the area, Mak said she hopes to tackle the issue with other departments.

    Tokyo Metro shares rocket higher on debut

  <img alt="Proceeds from the Tokyo Metro IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775777_1_20241023103553.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tokyo Metro shares soared more than 40 percent on their debut on Wednesday after its government owners raised US$2.3 billion in Japan's biggest initial public offering since 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)

    Celtics trounce Knicks to begin NBA title defence

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Jayson Tatum scored 37 points as the Boston Celtics launched the defence of their NBA crown with an emphatic 132-109 defeat of the New York Knicks on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a triumphant pre-game ceremony that saw Boston celebrate raising their record-breaking 18th championship banner, the Celtics delivered a performance that suggested they could well be the team to beat once more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A devastating 43-point first quarter put Boston in complete control during the first half, with Tatum producing an electric shooting performance to pour in 18 points from three-point range over the two quarters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum had brought the house down in a pre-game address to a packed TD Garden, signalling the Celtics' determination to win back-to-back championships.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is special. On behalf of me, my teammates, the organisation, we couldn't have done it without you last year," Tatum told the crowd.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Let's enjoy this moment together," he added. "I can honestly say, to the best fans in the world – let's do it again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boston powered to last season's NBA championship after winning 64 games in the regular season before dropping just three games in the playoffs, sealing victory with a 4-1 rout of the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That win came after years of frustrating postseason disappointments, which included a 4-2 defeat to Golden State in the 2022 NBA Finals and an agonising 4-3 loss to Miami in the 2023 Eastern Conference finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Celtics have retained the core of the team from last season's roster and look well-positioned to mount a serious defence of their title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Against New York on Tuesday, Joe Mazzulla's team picked up where they had left off in June, with all of their heavy-hitters coming up big to leave the Knicks chasing the game for long periods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four of the their five starters – Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday – posted double-digit points tallies before half-time, helping the team take a commanding 74-55 lead into the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although the Knicks had enjoyed parity in a 31-31 second quarter, the Celtics were in no mood to let their advantage slip after the break, coasting home to close out the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum finished with 10 assists and four rebounds in addition to his 37 points, with White adding 24 points and Brown 23. Holiday added 18 while Al Horford chipped in with 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jalen Brunson led the Knicks scoring with 22 points, alongside Miles McBride with 22 from the bench. (AFP)

    Aston Villa beat Bologna, go top of Champions League

  <img alt="Aston Villa's John McGinn with teammate Jhon Duran. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775757_1_20241023081956.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   John McGinn said there is no limit to Aston Villa's ambition in the Uefa Champions League after beating Bologna 2-0 to go top of the table in a dream return to the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Villa last played in the top tier of European football back in 1983 but Unai Emery's transformation of a sleeping giant knows no bounds as they became the only side to register three wins from three Champions League games so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGinn's free-kick flew beyond everyone into the far corner to open the scoring in the second half before Jhon Duran kept up his prolific strike rate on a rare start for the Colombian.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We don't want to stop here – it puts us in a great position," said McGinn, who joined the club when they were still in the second tier of English football in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What we are building here is amazing," he added. "This is home for me – it is my seventh season here, we've had ups and downs. It has been a rollercoaster. Hopefully we can keep climbing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bologna, by contrast, have just one point from their opening three games and one win in 11 games in all competitions this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Rossoblu were one of the stories of European football last season as they finished fifth in Serie A to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 60 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they have struggled since losing star players Riccardo Calafiori and Joshua Zirkzee to Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United, while coach Thiago Motta left to take charge of Juventus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emery said on the eve of the game he wants to "break barriers" at a club that has not won a trophy since 1996.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And the Spaniard showed the impressive strength in depth at his disposal with a comfortable win despite making four changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are playing focussed, responsible and the team is progressing and maturing in everything," said Emery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duran was finally handed his first start in either the Premier League or Champions League after scoring five times as a substitute this season. (AFP)

    Glasgow named host for 2026 Commonwealth Games

  <img alt="Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) CEO Katie Sadleir. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775755_1_20241023081604.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Glasgow has been confirmed as the host city for the troubled 2026 Commonwealth Games, which will be a slimmed-down version of the multi-sport event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The future of the 2026 Games was thrown into doubt when the Australian state of Victoria, the original hosts, withdrew last year, citing rising costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Scottish government effectively gave the green light to Glasgow last month and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) announced on Tuesday that the 2014 hosts will stage the next Games, from July 23 to August 2, 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Games will feature just 10 sports compared with the 19 on show at the 2022 edition in the English city of Birmingham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Para sport will once again be fully integrated as "a key priority and point of difference for the Games", with six para sports included on the programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The schedule will feature athletics and para athletics, swimming and para swimming, artistic gymnastics, track cycling and para track cycling, netball, weightlifting and para powerlifting, boxing, judo, bowls and para bowls, as well as 3x3 basketball and 3x3 wheelchair basketball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the sports missing out compared to the 2022 Games are triathlon, diving, hockey, T20 cricket, squash, badminton and rugby sevens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 3,000 athletes are expected to compete from up to 74 Commonwealth nations and territories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CGF said Glasgow 2026 would deliver more than US$130 million of inward investment into the city, with no need for public funding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia will provide part of the finance after Victoria pulled out, citing a projected cost of more than US$4 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On behalf of the entire Commonwealth sport movement, we are delighted to officially confirm that the 2026 Commonwealth Games will take place in the host city of Glasgow," said CGF chief executive Katie Sadleir.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commonwealth Games, held every four years, evolved out of the British Empire Games and is still made up mainly of countries and territories once subject to British imperial rule. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Arsenal bounced back from their embarrassment at Bournemouth as an own goal from Shakhtar Donetsk keeper Dmytro Riznyk gave the Gunners a 1-0 win in the Uefa Champions League on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mikel Arteta's side crashed to a damaging 2-0 defeat against the Cherries in the Premier League last weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That was Arsenal's first loss in all competitions since the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Bayern Munich in April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their response against Shakhtar was unconvincing, but they did enough to claim three points thanks to Riznyk's first half own goal from Gabriel Martinelli's strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leandro Trossard missed a late Arsenal penalty that would have put a flattering gloss on the scoreline at the Emirates Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Worryingly for Arteta, Riccardo Calafiori was forced off in the second half after appearing to injury his knee in the latest injury blow for a team currently missing Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Jurrien Timber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arteta is already without suspended French defender William Saliba for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice admitted his side let their "standards slip" after Saliba's red card against Bournemouth set them on the way to their first Premier League defeat this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arteta had urged his players to use the "pain" of that setback as motivation against Shakhtar, but the response was tepid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Gunners have seven points from their opening three Champions League games, yet this was a far cry from the impressive 2-0 win against Paris Saint-Germain in their previous tie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With one point from three games, Shakhtar remain without a goal in the Champions League this term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ukrainian champions spent 17 hours travelling to north London by bus, train and plane, setting off from Kiev on Friday and stopping in Lviv before reaching Poland for a flight to England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unable to play home European fixtures in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, Marino Pushych's side competed gamely but lacked a cutting edge. (AFP)

  <img alt="The flattish day came as US Treasury yields climbed, a dynamic that has sometimes pressured stocks.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks finished with little change on Tuesday, digesting a trove of mostly solid earnings while shrugging off higher treasury bond yields.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After opening lower, major indices pushed into positive territory in the afternoon before losing steam after that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The market is just kind of grinding and not doing a whole lot," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's indicative of a market taking a step back."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones ended essentially unchanged at 42,924.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,851, while the Nasdaq added 0.2 percent at 18,573.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The flattish day came as US Treasury yields climbed, a dynamic that has sometimes pressured stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think that there's a tension between the fact that yields are rising which obviously means that bonds are more competitive with stocks," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.

   "On the other hand, it's also indicative that the economy might be stronger than we thought it may have been. So you have that tension there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, General Motors shot up around 10 percent as it raised its full-year forecast, reflecting strong vehicle pricing that boosted third-quarter earnings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But GE Aerospace slumped 9.1 percent despite increasing its annual projections amid strong demand. However, analysts pointed to lingering concerns connected to a Boeing strike that has shuttered two US plane production plants. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a big US push for a ceasefire in Gaza, met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday after Washington called for an end to the war in Lebanon "as soon as possible".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken began his meetings in Israel as Hezbollah launched rockets into Tel Aviv and Haifa, and Israeli air strikes pummelled parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, including an air strike that caused a multi-storey building to entirely collapse and sent a fresh wave of panicked residents fleeing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His meetings with Netanyahu and other top officials also come as Israel weighs its response to Iran's October 1 missile attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to bring an end to both the year-long war in the Palestinian territory Gaza and to its spillover conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah said on Tuesday there would be no negotiations while fighting continues, and claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Netanyahu's holiday home on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington hopes the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar – Israel’s most wanted man, blamed for triggering the year of warfare by planning the deadly attacks on October 7 last year on Israel territory – will provide a new opportunity for peace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Israel has so far shown no sign of relenting in its military campaigns even after assassinating several leaders of Iran's allies Hamas and Hezbollah, which lost its powerful secretary-general Sayed Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken's week-long trip to the Middle East will also take him to Jordan and Qatar. US officials say he is focusing on plans for rebuilding and governing Gaza after the war, necessary for reaching a ceasefire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington has long said it ideally wants Gaza reunited with the West Bank under a government run by the Palestinian Authority, which now exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken also plans to speak to Israeli leaders about the expected strike on Iran and discourage any move that could massively escalate regional conflict, an official on the plane with him said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Gaza war began after Hamas-led fighters attacked Israeli communities on October 7 last year, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 42,718 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say. (Agencies)

   Another monkey at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens has died, bringing the death toll to 12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said a De Brazza’s monkey that had been put under isolation died on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A necropsy has been carried out to determine the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It followed the deaths of 11 monkeys since the middle of the month, caused by sepsis after they caught melioidosis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said earlier workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure and might have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government said the zoo's mammal section remains closed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also said the health conditions of 78 mammals and staff caring for the animals there are normal.

    Fresh bid to draw tourists to shopping malls

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Travel Industry Council (TIC) on Tuesday announced a new programme to arrange in-depth tours for tourists at shopping malls during mega events in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In collaboration with the hotel and retail sectors, the TIC has put 14 itineraries from six travel agencies on the China Mobile "MyLink" app targeting mainland visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A bar-hopping tour in Tsim Sha Tsui during the Wine and Dine festival and a tour featuring Hong Kong's urban legends are among those on offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fanny Yeung, the TIC's executive director, said the programme aims to leverage the city's mega events and encourage visitors to explore shopping malls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because right now a lot of individual travellers seldom visit shopping malls, and it didn't help us in our retail area. So we would like to include the retail part into this kind of in-depth tour to target this group of travellers," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Annie Yau Tse, chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, said five shopping malls will be covered, namely the IFC mall in Central, K11 Musea and THE ONE in Tsim Sha Tsui, Langham Place in Mong Kok, and the Temple Mall in Wong Tai Sin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said participants will receive gifts and discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After the pandemic, individual travellers come to Hong Kong for tourism experiences rather than shopping, so the current capacity is enough. [The new initiative] to bring group tourists to shopping malls is well within our capacity to accommodate," she said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Tuesday said they are investigating whether two men arrested in Tai Po for suspected burglary are connected to Sunday's break-in at the home of former police commissioner Andy Tsang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers received a report at 10.30pm on Monday that a flat at the Wonderland Housing Estate was burgled, with three watches worth around HK$290,000 being stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two men, aged 31 and 36, were arrested on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We found that the two suspects were hiding under a motorcycle cover outside a house in the village. When police identified themselves to the suspects, one of them tried to struggle and flee. He even pushed the police, causing the officer to suffer from a broken finger," said chief inspector Tam Tsz-wai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said both suspects are two-way permit holders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam added that the burgled flat is 1 kilometre away from Tsang's home, which was broken into on Sunday evening. A small amount of jewellery, watches and cash were stolen.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping and other world leaders have arrived in the Russian city of Kazan for the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi was greeted at the airport by Russian officials upon his arrival on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He later met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hailed ties between the two countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and the international situation is chaotic and intertwined," Xi told Putin, praising the "profound friendship" between Beijing and Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ties have "injected strong impetus into the development, revitalisation and modernisation of the two countries" and have "made important contributions to upholding international equity and justice," Xi said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the two sides "have found the right way for neighbouring major countries to get along with each other which features non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party," according to Xinhua News Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa are among the leaders joining the Brics gathering in Kazan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is also undertaking his first trip to Russia since April 2022 to attend the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as the largest foreign-policy event ever held by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of US-led efforts to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Brics alliance, which initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed an interest in joining. (Agencies)

    HSBC restructures operations in overhaul

  <div class="itemFullText">
   HSBC Holdings said on Tuesday it would combine its commercial and investment banking operations in a major overhaul under new CEO Georges Elhedery that has also seen key senior staff depart.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seeking to simplify the Asia-focused bank's business and reduce costs, HSBC said it would be restructuring into four business units and slashing senior management positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new leadership structure, which includes the appointment of Pam Kaur as the lender's first female chief financial officer, would "unleash our full potential and drive success into the future," Elhedery said in a memo to staff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elhedery, like many bank executives, is under pressure to address climbing costs and better manage expenses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group is carving up its operations into four business lines, namely UK, Hong Kong, corporate and institutional banking, and wealth banking. The new corporate and institutional banking unit will house a newly combined commercial banking and global banking and markets business, and western wholesale banking businesses, including Europe and the Americas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kaur, 60, who currently serves as HSBC's chief risk and compliance officer, joined the bank in April 2013 as group head of internal audit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jon Bingham, interim Group CFO, will resume his role of Global Financial Controller, HSBC said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In other key management changes, Greg Guyett, CEO Global Banking and Markets, will assume a newly created role of Chair, Strategic Clients Group. Colin Bell, CEO of HSBC Bank and Europe, has decided to step down to pursue other opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank, which employs about 214,000 people globally, has been removing duplicate roles for years and reducing its businesses in Western markets such as the United States, France and Canada as it focuses on Asia and markets where it has scale. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Beijing said on Tuesday it had reached a "resolution" with India over issues related to the border, after New Delhi said it had struck a deal with central authorities for military patrols along the frontier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Recently, China and India have maintained close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues relating to the China-India border. Currently, the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant issues," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China and India, the world's two most populous nations, have regularly accused each other of trying to seize territory along a narrow strip of land known as the Line of Actual Control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a border skirmish in 2020 that killed four Chinese soldiers, and at least 20 Indian ones, both sides pulled back tens of thousands of troops and agreed not to send patrols into the Line of Actual Control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lin said on Tuesday that Beijing "gives its positive approval" to the deal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the next stage, we will work with India to properly implement that resolution," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lin, however, did not say whether the deal paved the way for an official meeting between President Xi Jinping and India's leader Narendra Modi at the Brics summit in Russia this week. (AFP)

   Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330," Lam added.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   MTR officials have warned that services on the Tung Chung Line are expected to be curtailed late on Saturday night, with no trains travelling between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Free shuttle buses will be provided for people to travel between the two stations as major track diversion works take place as part of the Tung Chung Line extension in the two hours before the line's usual closure time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The railway company said the last train from Tung Chung will depart at 11.01pm, while the last train going all the way to Tung Chung will leave Hong Kong Station at 11.07pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trains from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay and vice-versa will run as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company’s chief of airport segment, Ben Lui, said services might also be affected on Sunday if there is any delay to the works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We have done a lot of preparation and planning, and our team will work closely together. Hopefully, we will have all the works completed before the next traffic day,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We will try our best, and strive for the early completion of the works, without affecting train services on the next day.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a tropical cyclone expected to move closer to Hong Kong, the works may be postponed to the following Saturday if the weather is too bad, Lui said.

    Auctions for Lunar New Year fair stalls kick off

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four fast food stalls at Victoria Park's annual Lunar New Year fair were auctioned off on Tuesday for a total of more than HK$600,000 with authorities saying the result reflected the current market sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bidding for the stalls – one of which would have cost more than HK$500,000 before the Covid pandemic – saw two of the successful offers reaching the base price of HK$124,700. The amount for the most expensive stall reached HK$182,000, while the fourth stall was sold at HK$2,000 less than that amount.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which is in charge of the auction, said the prices reflected the current market situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top bidder, surnamed Ng, said there were just a handful of bidders this time around, compared to more than a dozen in the preceding year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will probably earn less of a profit compared to last year. But it's still worth a shot," he told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The bidding was less competitive because I know some fellow snack sellers are having a tough time making a living out there. So they didn't join the bidding."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A florist who successfully acquired a stall at the fair also thought the competition for flower stalls was not too fierce, because some sellers ended up with a lot of unsold stock last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Auctions for other stalls, including those for dry goods, will be held in the next two days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will feature nearly 400 stalls at Victoria Park for a week starting from January 23.

    N Korea denies it sent troops to Russia

  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korea has not sent troops to Russia to help Moscow fight Ukraine, one of its United Nations representatives said on Monday, dismissing Seoul's claims as a "groundless rumour".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency had said that Pyongyang sent a "large-scale" troop deployment to help its ally, claiming that 1,500 special forces were already training in Russia's Far East and ready to head soon for the frontlines of the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for the so-called military cooperation with Russia, my delegation does not feel any need for comment on such groundless stereotyped rumours," a North Korean representative said at a committee meeting during the UN General Assembly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's claims were "aimed at smearing the image of the DPRK and undermining the legitimate, friendly and cooperative relations between two sovereign states," the representative told the meeting, held late on Monday in New York.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korean state media have not commented on the purported troop deployment, and Russia has also not confirmed the troop deployment, but defended its military cooperation with the North.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Seoul summoned Moscow's ambassador in South Korea to complain, the envoy "stressed that cooperation between Russia and North Korea... is not directed against the interests of South Korea's security".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neither Nato nor the United States have confirmed the deployment, but both have cast it as a potentially dangerous escalation in the long-running Ukraine conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have seen reports the DPRK has sent forces and is preparing to send additional soldiers to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia," Robert Wood, US ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If true, this marks a dangerous and highly concerning development and an obvious deepening of the DPRK-Russia military relationship," Wood said. (AFP)

   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 late on Thursday or early Friday, if Tropical Cyclone Trami follows its projected path and edges closer to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to the present forecast, Trami to the east of the Philippines will intensify gradually and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong," meteorologists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, which is Vietnamese for a type of Camellia, is expected to move west towards the vicinity of Hainan in the coming days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon warning signal could eventually be possible, depending on the storm's movement and wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters also warned that the weather will deteriorate this weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Under the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon, it will be windy and become cloudy with a few showers over the coast of southern China later on Friday and over the weekend."

    'Lack of care led to sports association data breach'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) on Tuesday accused the South China Athletic Association (SCAA) of having inadequate policies and a lack of care, after a data breach affecting more than 72,300 members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An attack by a hacker in March resulted in a breach of members’ personal information, including ID card numbers, passport details, phone numbers, photos and addresses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The privacy watchdog said the SCAA accidentally exposed its servers to the internet, which the hacker took advantage of to infiltrate the network and launch the attacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association was also accused of lacking a proper detection system for attacks. The watchdog said the attacker made over 20,000 attempts to log in to one of the servers for four hours, without being interrupted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCPD said the same hacker had successfully installed malicious software on the sports organisation's system two years ago, although no data was stolen at the time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung criticised the SCAA for failing to spot that attack until the data leak this year, saying it didn’t carry out regular checks or risk assessments
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The association, as a long-established sports association holding a significant amount of personal data, should be vigilant about cybersecurity and data security. I am very disappointed that the association failed to implement effective information system security measures to safeguard members' personal data prior to the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe that if the association had deployed sufficient detection measures or alert tools back in 2022, there would have been a good chance of detecting the malicious activities at the early stage of the [March] hacking attack,” Chung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PCPD ruled that the SCAA violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, and an enforcement notice was issued to the association to fix the issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, the SCAA said it acknowledged the investigation findings and will adhere to the PCPD’s enforcement notice.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said it imposed a series of remedial measures after the incident in question, and pledged to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the PCPD said it has observed a concerning rise in data breaches involving non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The watchdog received 61 data breach notifications from schools and NGOs last year, an increase of about 1.5 times compared to 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chung said NGOs and schools often hold a lot of sensitive personal data, making them attractive targets for hackers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She urged them to stay vigilant against cyber attacks and bolster their data security resources.

    Kevin Yeung praised for 'swift' monkey deaths response

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday praised the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism for his quick response over a spate of monkey deaths at Hong Kong's zoo, after two more of the apes died over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest squirrel monkey deaths at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens takes the total number of fatalities to 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Lee said Kevin Yeung did exactly what was expected of him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[In] the first instance, the problem was contained to stop it from spreading. Monitoring measures were put in place. Autopsy examinations and tests have been expedited. The result was instantly disseminated to the general public," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities are still determining if the two monkeys that recently died were infected with melioidosis like the other nine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive's praise came after Yeung was seemingly put on notice last week, when Lee unveiled in the annex of his third Policy Address that he had 'instructed' the minister to complete the blueprint for the Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, which is behind schedule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung had told reporters he did not feel that he was being pressured, adding he will finish the blueprint soon.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said key performance indicators (KPI) that he introduced after assuming office have helped Hong Kong climb in some international rankings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters before an Executive Council meeting, Lee noted that Hong Kong went up in a number of global assessments, including in one report published last month by think tanks based in Britain and Shenzhen, in which the SAR surpassed Singapore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm glad to see that in almost two-and-a-half years' governance, and also the new measures that we've introduced, the position of Hong Kong as an international financial centre has increased one position, so we've come back to top three."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When asked by reporters about officials not completing six of the 150 tasks Lee set out in last year's Policy Address, he explained that there were reasonable causes for the delays and that he is satisfied with the overall KPI results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Indicators are means. Indicators are not themselves an end. We must see how these indicators will work for us," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also stressed that the people in general agree with the need for reform, which was the main theme of his policy blueprint last week.

    First phase of plastics ban went smoothly: John Lee

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said a six-month "adaption period" following the start of a ban on various single-use plastics went smoothly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of a grace period means violators can now face fines of up to HK$100,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Talking to reporters ahead of an Executive Council meeting, Lee said the aim is to bring about behavioural change rather than punish people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am glad to see that there are good results in the catering sector, in the building management sector, in the hotel sector, which indicated that there has been a lot of disposable cutlery saved as a result of this plastic-free culture we want to build," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the government needs to consider a range of factors before moving on to the next phase of the plastics ban which will cover takeaway items, among other things.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will, first of all, prepare society and the businesses, particularly when we decide as to how we will go to the next stage, i.e. whether there will be sufficient alternative products available in the market for society to move smoothly into the next stage, and, more importantly, affordable prices, because what we learned from the first phase is, despite the fact that we all subscribe to this plastic-free culture, it is an important change of behaviour," the CE said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We also want businesses to be able to go through the process in a smooth manner, and people will be paying an affordable price for all this change of behaviour."

    Hurricane Oscar leaves six dead in Cuba

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hurricane Oscar left six people dead after hitting Cuba over the weekend during a major power blackout, authorities said on Monday, as electricity was restored to most of the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lights went out for the country's 10 million people on Friday after the collapse of the nation's largest power plant crippled the whole grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By Monday afternoon, nearly 90 percent of customers in Havana – home to some two million people – had power again, the capital's electricity company said in a report published by state-run news portal Cubadebate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course I'm happy!" Olga Gomez, a 59-year-old housewife in Havana, said after the lights came back on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have an elderly senile mother of 85 and an autistic son. It's very difficult when there's no power," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many residents outside Havana, however, remained without electricity, according to the authorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba was still bathed in darkness on Sunday when Hurricane Oscar made landfall in the eastern part of the country as a Category 1 storm, causing several deaths and damage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Regrettably, according to preliminary information, six lives have been lost," President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a televised remarks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The storm caused severe damage in the eastern province of Guantanamo, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Oscar weakened into a tropical storm as it moved inland but was still expected to bring "significant, life-threatening flash flooding along with mudslides," the US National Hurricane Center warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Roofs and the walls of houses were damaged, and electricity poles and trees felled, state television reported. (AFP)

    UN resolution basis for Lebanon ceasefire 'not enough'

  <img alt='US special envoy Amos Hochstein has called for additional measures to ensure UN resolution 1701 was implemented "fairly, accurately and transparently". Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775538_1_20241021212807.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US special envoy Amos Hochstein said on Monday that the United States was working on a formula to end the conflict between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah for good, and that merely committing to a previous UN resolution would not be enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 states that only the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers should be deployed in southern Lebanon, while demanding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It may have ended the last round of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in 2006, but the Iranian-backed Shi'ite movement did not end its presence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Attention has focused on the resolution again during the latest Israel-Hezbollah war that erupted last month after nearly a year of cross-border fire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hochstein, visiting Lebanon for the second time in two months, was holding talks with Lebanese officials in a new US mediation push to bring peace to the Middle East after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Both sides simply committing to (UN resolution) 1701 is not enough," Hochstein told a press conference in the capital Beirut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the resolution remained as a basis for ending the conflict, additional measures were needed to ensure it was implemented "fairly, accurately and transparently".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are working with government of Lebanon, the state of Lebanon, as well as the government of Israel to get to a formula that brings an end to this conflict once and for all," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's assault on Hezbollah has raised fears of a wider regional conflict between Israel and Hezbollah's patron, Iran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After what he called a "very constructive" meeting with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a close ally of Hezbollah who has been engaging in diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, Hochstein said:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The United States wants to end this conflict absolutely as soon as possible. That is what President Biden wants, that is what we all are working towards." (Reuters/AFP)

    Moldova votes in favour of EU membership

  <img alt="The “No” vote in favour of Moldova's EU membership appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775551_1_20241022004607.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Moldovans voted, by a razor-thin majority, in favour of securing the country’s path toward European Union membership by 2030, electoral data showed on Monday, after the pro-Western president accused “criminal groups” of trying to undermine the vote in the former Soviet republic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The “No” vote appeared to be ahead until the last few thousand votes were counted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With 99.41 percent of votes counted in the EU referendum held Sunday, the “Yes” vote stood at 50.39 percent and the “No” vote at 49.61 percent, according to the Central Electoral Commission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the presidential race that was held at the same time, President Maia Sandu won the first round with 42 percent of the vote in a field of 11, short of an outright majority. She will face Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who outperformed polls with around 26 percent of the vote, in a runoff on November 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, Sandu reiterated claims that unprecedented voter fraud and foreign interference had undermined the voting, calling it a “vile attack” on Moldova’s sovereignty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Unfortunately, the justice system failed to do enough to prevent vote-rigging and corruption," she told a news conference. “Here, too, we must draw a line, correct what went wrong, and learn the lesson. We heard you: we know we must do more to fight corruption.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moldovan authorities claim that Moscow has intensified a “hybrid war” campaign to destabilise the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections and backing a major vote-buying scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russia has repeatedly denied interfering, and, in turn, called on Sandu to "present evidence" of election interference in the country of 2.6 million people and alleged "anomalies" in Moldova's vote count.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU defended Sandu, with president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen hailing the outcome of the referendum in a post on X: "In the face of Russia's hybrid tactics, Moldova shows that it is independent, it is strong and it wants a European future!"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moldova applied to join the EU in the wake of the outbreak of Russia’s war with Ukraine in February 2022, and was granted candidate status, alongside Ukraine. Membership negotiations were agreed to start in June. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital said on Tuesday that it's expanding its services providing "upgraded" benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) surgeries, so more patients can be treated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A new service model, used to treat BPH, has been in use since late 2022, and has treated about 250 patients since then.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng Chi-fai, a cluster service coordinator at the New Territories East Cluster, said a minimally invasive procedure had been adopted, allowing patients to be treated outside the operating room.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are using water steam to heat up the prostate tissue, to make the prostate tissue die, and it will shrink the size of the prostate, or using some small pins to compress on the prostate tissue so that the prostate lumen, the channel, can be widened. Therefore, the patient can void better," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Traditionally, we are doing this procedure in the operating theatre. In our new surface model, we are using local anaesthesia, and we also perform the procedure in our day treatment centre."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng added that patients normally have to stay at the hospital for two days if they undergo the traditional surgery, but this is unnecessary with the upgraded service model.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Patients have the procedure done within 15 to 30 minutes, and then after we observe them for maybe one or two hours, they will be discharged," he said, adding that whole process is completed within half a day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ng said the new service model enabled them to double the number of patients being treated, and the waiting time for patients had fallen to four months, from 12 months originally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said about 65 percent of patients using urinary catheters could receive the surgery within two months.

   Tiger Woods is expected to make his TGL debut on January 14, the new tech-infused indoor team golf league announced on Monday, along with the full schedule for its inaugural season that will be held entirely in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 15-time major champion's first potential match will come in the second week of the season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is set to be held inside a venue that fits 1,500 fans, wrapped around a field of play featuring a five-storey-high simulator screen and an adjustable putting surface.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old Woods, who had back surgery in September and played a limited schedule in recent years due to injuries, is a part owner of Jupiter Links Golf Club, a team that features himself, Max Homa, Tom Kim and Kevin Kisner. (Reuters)

   Brazil superstar Neymar returned to action on Monday following more than a year out, with the Al Hilal forward appearing as a second-half substitute in his side's gripping 5-4 win against Asian champions Al Ain in the UAE.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker, 32, had not played since rupturing his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty in October last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neymar, who underwent surgery and a sustained period of rehabilitation, is his country's all-time leading goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 appearances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Named on the Hilal bench for the first time since his injury, he was introduced on 76 minutes of the Asian Champions Elite encounter at a heaving Hazzan Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By then, the record four-time Asian champions, who lead the current Saudi Pro League, were 5-3 up, thanks to goals from Renan Lodi and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and a Salem Al Dawsari hat-trick.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neymar cannot be registered for the Saudi top-flight until January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I need to prepare Neymar with games; that's the only possible means to bring him to his level, which was the idea today," Hilal coach Jorge Jesus said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are some risks for the team because we need to use the games to prepare him, but it's the only way to have one of our important players back at the highest level," the Portuguese boss added. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka said on Monday she hopes to stay at the top of the world rankings a little longer than last time after returning to the number one WTA spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 26-year-old jumped above Poland's French Open champion Iga Swiatek thanks to year-end adjustments in the standings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This season's US and Australian Open champion Sabalenka spent just eight weeks at the top of the rankings in September 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "N1...," she said on X, formerly Twitter. "Let's see for how long this time," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka has lost just one match since mid-August in a run which included her success at Flushing Meadows and her next tournament could be the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia on November 2 to 9.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Swiatek, who won her third straight Roland Garros title in June, had held the top ranking since late last year. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 retreated from records on Monday as treasury bond yields rose in the first session of a heavy week of earnings reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Perhaps the market is reacting to higher bond yields and higher oil prices," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Capital Management, said of the mostly down session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.8 percent at 42,931.60.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,853.98, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.3 percent at 18,540.01.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts described a relatively light day in terms of economic news, with the main story that China's central bank had cut two key interest rates in a move to stimulate the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ablin said many investors are "sitting tight" with the US presidential election now in its home stretch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It just seems like an awkward time to be making big bets," he said. "We'll know a lot more in two weeks we hope."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Boeing rose 3.1 percent after labour negotiators agreed to present a new contract to 33,000 Seattle-area workers, potentially resolving the month-long machinist union strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Disney shed 0.6 percent after announcing that it plans to name a new CEO in early 2026. The company named former Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman as chairperson, replacing former Nike CEO Mark Parker.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This week's earnings calendar includes reports from General Motors, Boeing, UPS and Tesla. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Monday said that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka is pulling out of this month's tournament due to injury, though the Japanese star will still meet fans in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former world number one injured her back during the China Open earlier this month, and has since skipped multiple tournaments, including the Japan Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I love visiting the [SAR] tournament and despite the obvious disappointment of not being able to play, I want to reassure all my wonderful Hong Kong fans that I will still be attending the event," Osaka said in a statement through the Hong Kong China Tennis Association.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very much looking forward to meeting you all."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association expressed disappointment, but stressed that the event will still be highly competitive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Participating players include defending champion Leylah Fernandez, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one Simona Halep, as well as former US Open Champion Emma Raducanu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Qualifiers for the local tournament, a WTA250 series, are due to take place at Victoria Park on Saturday. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    Britain's King Charles heckled by Australian senator

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Britain's King Charles was accused of "genocide" by an Indigenous senator at Australia's Parliament House on Monday, moments after he delivered a speech in which he paid his "respects to the traditional owners of the lands".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Charles, on his 16th official visit to Australia and his first major foreign trip since being diagnosed with cancer, had finished speaking when independent senator and Indigenous activist Lidia Thorpe shouted that she did not accept Charles' sovereignty over Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You committed genocide against our people," she said. "Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us – our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want treaty."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thorpe, who has disrupted previous events protesting over the colonisation of Australia, was stopped from approaching the king, who spoke quietly to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the podium but was otherwise unfazed. Thorpe was then escorted out of the chamber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The protest was an outlier among a stream of tributes to Charles and Queen Camilla from dignitaries and well-wishers in the crowds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albanese praised Charles for his long advocacy about the threat of climate change and spoke about the respect Australians had for their monarch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visit to parliament followed a trip to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra where the royal couple met more than a thousand well-wishers including Hephner, a nine-year old alpaca in a suit with a crown perched atop his fluffy white head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hephner, named after Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, waited for hours alongside owner Robert Fletcher and long lines of others outside the memorial for the chance to greet the royal couple on their one-day tour of the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He has many outfits and this is one we've saved specifically for today," said Fletcher. "One king meets another king."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hephner's patience paid off. On a 30-minute walk to greet the crowds, Charles stopped to pat the alpaca, pulling back with a laugh when Hephner snorted in his face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The royal couple continue their visit to Australia in Sydney on Tuesday, before heading to Samoa for a meeting of countries in the British Commonwealth. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of a major trade exhibition company in Hong Kong on Monday said he wants to see more measures to revive the struggling convention and exhibition industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week’s Policy Address outlined plans to spend HK$500 million on launching the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions 2.0, to help the sector stay afloat and promote the mega-event economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Duncan Cheung, director of ComAsia Limited, said geopolitical tensions and manpower shortages are hindering recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In Hong Kong, the exhibition business also suffers from the lack of manpower. For the recovery of the industry, I think it needs more time because you saw so many geopolitical problems,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung said the government should allocate more money to the international exhibition industry and extend the scheme beyond 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "International exhibitions can bring international exhibitors and also international buyers and visitors to come to Hong Kong. These kinds of visitors or exhibitors have to live in hotels and [benefit] the hotel industry, food and beverage industry and also travel industry."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung said the exhibition industry has downsized due to the pandemic and has now only resumed to around 70 percent of pre-Covid levels.

    Arabic learning drive a ticket to success: scholar

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A misunderstanding over the government’s apparent ambitions to require taxi drivers learn Arabic has been a hot topic of discussion in recent days, and has even been a target of derision by some in the trade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the head of the University of Hong Kong’s Arabic programme, Amjad Refai, says this is actually a great idea for Hongkongers – and learning Arabic isn’t as difficult as some may think.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee had said in his latest Policy Address that relevant sectors should provide service information in Arabic to lure in more Middle Eastern tourists, but officials have since clarified that this doesn’t mean cabbies will be expected to learn to converse in Arabic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Monday that they just want more information to be made available in Arabic to help travellers find taxis or Muslim-friendly facilities more easily.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Transport chief Lam Sai-hung also said it would be a good thing if drivers could learn a few simple Arabic phrases such as greetings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Refai agrees that learning to say hello: أهلاً (ahlaan) or thank you: شكراً (shkraan) isn’t the toughest thing in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don't believe there is an easy language or there is a difficult language. There is no such thing,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The academic, who has written a textbook for people learning Arabic as a second language, says while learning a language that’s very different from the mother tongue of students makes things challenging, it’s far from insurmountable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We need to make an easy approach for the students,” Refai said. “I don't think Arabic is a difficult language – it's different… new… so students may face challenges and they need to [make] efforts to be familiar with it.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Refai said more and more universities and even private schools here have been offering Arabic courses in recent years, and there was a spike in the number of students learning the language between 2016 and 2019.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, he says since Covid hit, there has been a “shocking” decline in student numbers in Hong Kong in contrast to the mainland, where people seem to be more aware of the advantages of learning a language spoken in countries that are becoming increasingly important trading partners both to the territory and the nation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I was expecting that everyone will try to compete to learn Arabic and the numbers are increasing but I don't see this on ground,” Refai lamented.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In [the] mainland for decades we know the importance of Arabic language and nearly all universities –  even the regional universities – teach Arabic as majors, and a lot of students are studying Arabic on the mainland because they can see the potential of the Arab world.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He says the advent of artificial intelligence may have affected peoples’ appetite for learning new languages, as AI makes translation and communications much easier. But he’s still shocked that people here aren’t seizing the career opportunities that would be afforded by learning Arabic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It's still a decent amount of people are learning Arabic, but less than the years I'm talking about – 2016 and 2019 – which has not only surprised me, it shocked me actually, because the Hong Kong and China governments, as part of the initiative of the New Belt and Road, are extending hands towards the Arab world.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He says the best way to learn a new language is via in-person classes, where teachers can best use the human element to communicate face-to-face with their students.

   South Korea on Monday summoned the Russian ambassador to criticise what it claimed as Pyongyang's decision to send thousands of soldiers to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, the foreign ministry there said, calling for their immediate withdrawal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising and likely to head to the front lines soon, Seoul's spy agency said on Friday, with additional troops set to depart soon, Pyongyang's first such deployment overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea has long claimed the nuclear-armed North is supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, and Seoul expressed alarm over the troop deployment, which comes after Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a military deal in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul expressed its "grave concerns regarding North Korea's recent dispatch of troops to Russia and strongly urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean forces", vice foreign minister Kim Hong-kyun told Russian ambassador Georgiy Zinoviev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency released detailed satellite images showing the first batch of 1,500 North Korean special forces from the elite "Storm Corps" had arrived in Vladivostok on Russian military vessels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move "poses a significant security threat not only to South Korea but to the international community", Kim said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Russian ambassador Zinovyev "stressed that cooperation between Russia and North Korea... is not directed against the interests of South Korea's security", the embassy said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it hopes all parties will work to de-escalate the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “China’s position is consistent and clear,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said during a regular briefing in Beijing, as he urged parties involved to “commit themselves to a political solution".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato, which has not yet confirmed the North Korean troop deployments, said that it "would mark a significant escalation" in the conflict, chief Mark Rutte said on X. (AFP/Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Foreign Minister Wang Yi has told visiting former French prime minister Laurent Fabius that he hopes China and the European Union (EU) could find ways to resolve trade tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has voiced opposition to an EU decision to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, and has imposed tariffs on EU brandy imports as part of the trade row.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang said setbacks in bilateral economic and trade relations do not serve the interests of either side in his talks with Fabius, who's now president of the French Constitutional Council, in Beijing on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The foreign minister said the two sides should find ways to address their respective concerns through negotiation and consultation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fabius stressed the need to resolve disputes through dialogue as well. (Agencies)

    'Slashed liquor duty boosts Wine and Spirits Fair'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Trade Development Council on Monday said the government's decision to reduce the city's spirits duty came just in time for the Wine and Spirits Fair, with more vendors expected to showcase a wider selection of liquor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six hundred exhibitors from 20 countries and regions will take part in the fair, and it comes on the heels of the government's decision to cut the duty on liquor with an alcohol content of over 30 percent and with an import price of more than HK$200 to 10 percent from 100 percent for the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a media preview for the event, the council's Deputy Executive Director, Sophia Chong, said more than 20 percent of vendors would be bringing hard liquor to the fair, which takes place from November 7 to 9.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Like this time, we have whiskey from Ireland as well. All these liquor, brandy, tequila, and all these spirits and liquor can also be traded via Hong Kong to the rest of Asia, including mainland China," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vendor Andrew Wong said more people will have the chance to taste high-end spirits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "People may be drinking medium or low-level [spirits], and they now can have more room to drink good quality [spirits] with a reasonable price," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But fellow vendor Simon Disler said the duty reduction was not big enough to give him the wiggle room to offer more discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For five or ten percent of my items, I would be able to offer discounts to my customers. But for the other 90 percent, there won't be a discount," he explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will be held at the Convention and Exhibition Centre where wines and spirits, including baijiu, sake and vodka will be showcased.

    Civil servants to get three days of childcare leave

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government says it plans to offer three days of childcare leave a year to civil servants with children under three, a move expected to benefit some 12,000 employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The administration on Monday said the family-friendly policy is expected to start in April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco public service panel meeting, several unionist lawmakers asked why officials have decided on three days and then only for parents of children under three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They asked whether more days off could be offered and whether the leave could be extended to parents of older children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung said Singapore offers six days of childcare leave.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung said officials are already striking a balance between several factors, adding that the scheme will be reviewed after implementation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We roll out government-friendly measures for government workers, but then there's also a need for manpower, and operational needs for departments. We have to be prudent with this new measure," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At that preschool age below three, children usually stay at home. They need more care at home. That's why we set the threshold at three years old."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan and former minister Lai Tung-kwok of the New People's Party asked whether civil servants could be given a day off for their birthday, with Lai saying this would provide a morale boost to those who don't have children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said officials will consider the suggestion, but providing leave does come with a financial burden for the government.

    'Function over price when eateries buy cutlery'

  <img alt="Alvis Yip says the prices of his company's non-plastic cutlery have dropped by 10 percent. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775450_2_20241021142141.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A company that supplies wooden and bamboo forks, knives and spoons to restaurants on Monday said price has become a far less significant factor for eateries when making purchases of cutlery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Maybe I can use the knife as an example. At the beginning people are just concerned about the price. They choose a wooden knife and fork but because of the functionality of the wood it cannot cut like a harder steak. So people now choose the bamboo fork and knife which can be used to cut the steak easily,” Alvis Yip, founder of Supply Ching Company said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said his products were initially about 20 percent to 30 percent more expensive than the plastic ones, but his prices have now dropped by about 10 percent, benefiting from economies of scale.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip was one of four suppliers invited by the Environmental Protection Department to showcase their products to the press six months ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the event, another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak, but the fork snapped during two attempts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked whether the issue affected his sales in any way, Yip said it actually gave customers more confidence in his products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “At the beginning we were concerned about that incident, that will it affect the reputation of sustainable food packaging. But after that event it kind of benefits us because while the citizens are often laughing at the presentation, the restaurants are actually more concerned about the functionality. That event created chances or situations for us to explain more of our products' details to our customers,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip said he also noticed a significant drop in reliance on one-off cutlery as people adapt to more sustainable options, but stressed he is not worried about his sales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s like that restaurants are preparing for, for example, 10,000 sets of cutlery because they are using the assumption from plastic cutlery, but then they end up just using 5,000 for a month. So monthly usage can drop by 50 percent,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But I can draw more customers using our quality and new designs and new materials by increasing our functionalities… We will just have some good quality supplies left in the market in the end.”

    'Monkey enclosure can reopen when situation improves'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Monday said the authorities will consider reopening the mammals section of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens when a health scare involving monkeys there comes to an end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A De Brazza’s monkey, three common squirrel monkeys, four white-faced sakis and three cotton-top tamarins have died in the past week or so, with tests on some of them revealing they had melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria in soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure earlier this month and may have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a radio programme, Yeung said one monkey is still undergoing quarantine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When the situation is back to normal, we'll consider reopening the area. We've observed their behaviour and sometimes it was a little unusual compared to normal," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The condition of the monkey in quarantine fluctuates. Sometimes it is bad and sometimes it is good. It's receiving medical treatment."

    Single-use plastics ban running smoothly: EPD

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Environmental Protection Department says the first phase of the city's single-use plastics ban has been implemented smoothly and orderly, with a six-month adaptation period concluding on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an interview with RTHK, deputy director of the department Kenneth Cheng said 80 percent of customers of chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have chosen not to offer any takeaway utensils.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department estimates that 30 million fewer sets of disposable cutlery than usual have been given out by the catering sector since the ban took effect in April, Cheng said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He praised the hotel sector for being “ahead of the international trend” by reducing its use of plastics by 80 percent over the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheng said shopping malls and office buildings have stopped giving out disposable umbrella bags and few people have been using glow sticks or party hats during festive events, showing that a culture of reducing plastic is gradually developing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules now face fines of up to HK$100,000, but Cheng said the department will prioritise education over punishment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We can see that the culture of reducing plastic is progressing. We don't believe that heavily penalising businesses is the right way to implement this culture. Instead, we think it should be achieved through promotion and education. But of course we will enforce the law after the adaptation period, but the focus will be on primary suppliers,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We inspected the selling points in the past and identified those that have not yet met the requirements. We will inspect them again and will issue a written warning to them if they haven’t improved. We will give them 10 more days to make the necessary changes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked when the second phase of the ban, which will cover items including takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups, will be introduced, Cheng said there is currently no specific timetable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the move will depend on factors such as social acceptance, available replacements and international trends.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tommy Edman and Will Smith homered to send Shohei Ohtani into the World Series for the first time, and the Los Angeles Dodgers eliminated the New York Mets with a 10-5 victory in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers took the best-of-seven National League Championship Series 4-2 over the Mets and will open the World Series at home on Friday against the New York Yankees, who own a record 27 titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This will be the Dodgers' 22nd World Series –13th in Los Angeles – and first since 2020, when they beat Tampa Bay during the pandemic-delayed season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees are back in the World Series for the 41st time and first in 15 years. Game 1 is Friday at Dodger Stadium, pitting New York slugger Aaron Judge and Ohtani – MLB's top home-run hitters this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s kind of what the people wanted, what we all wanted,” Dodgers star Mookie Betts said. “It’s going to be a battle of two good teams – a lot of long flights across the country.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It’ll be the 12th time the storied franchises meet in the World Series and the first in 43 years. The Yankees have beaten the Dodgers eight times, while the Dodgers’ three championships against the Bronx Bombers came in 1955, 1963 and 1981.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s the place that I’ve dreamt of playing all my life,” Ohtani said through a translator, “and to be able to finally come to this stage and be able to play and hopefully win it is my next goal.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani, playing his first season with the Dodgers after agreeing to a record-breaking contract in free agency, had two hits and scored two runs in Game 6. He hit .364 with two homers and six RBIs in the NLCS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Not bad for his first postseason after spending six years with the Los Angeles Angels, who never had a winning record or reached the playoffs during his tenure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers eliminated the Mets on their second try in the series. They outscored New York 40-26 in the six games. None of the games were close, with the Dodgers earning two shutouts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, meanwhile, came within two wins of reaching the World Series after a 22-33 start. (AFP/AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Monday said officials will study how to make better use of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In last week's Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR will publish an action plan on developing cruise tourism to enhance the terminal's role as a hub for conventions and exhibitions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We now hope to see if we can better utilise the space of the cruise terminal. For example, can we make use of the rooftop area? It's currently a park. Is there anything else we can do there? How can we promote more convention and exhibition activities?" Yeung told a radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about Singapore receiving more cruise ships than Hong Kong in July and August, the minister said it's not a fair comparison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Traditionally, Hong Kong's typhoon season runs from May to August. This doesn't exist in some places, for example Singapore. So, comparing cruise ship numbers in July and August is not the best," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's not about how many typhoons we have in July and August, but because cruise lines won't take risks in their scheduling during the typhoon season."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung also said more will be done to develop "horse racing tourism" as outlined in the policy blueprint, such as working with the Jockey Club to promote international horse-racing events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said authorities need to carefully consider whether the current 18-year-old age limit for racegoers would be lowered.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey bagged two golds and a bronze to conclude the first stop of the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Shanghai on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Olympic medallist won her first medal of the competition on Saturday in the women's 200 metres freestyle, with a time of 1 minute 51.46 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haughey, who won two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics, brought more good news on the final day in Shanghai by winning a bronze in the 50 metres breaststroke, followed by a gold in the 100 metres freestyle only 15 minutes later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She came third in the breaststroke event after finishing with a time of 29.74 seconds – behind China's Tang Qianting and Benedetta Pilato of Italy – to create a new Hong Kong record, and dominated the freestyle event by leading from start to finish, ending with a time of 51.89 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second leg of the World Cup will be held in Incheon, South Korea from October 24-26, while the last stop will be in Singapore from October 31 to November 2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The World Cup is a qualifying event for the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) in Budapest at the end of the year.

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775443_2_20241021114359.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The New York Liberty won the 2024 WNBA championship after beating the Minnesota Lynx 67-62 in overtime of a decisive Game 5 on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jonquel Jones scored 17 points to lead New York, which was one of the original franchises in the league. The Liberty made the WNBA Finals five times before, losing each one, including last season. This time they wouldn’t be denied, although it took an extra five minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win gave the city of New York its first basketball title since 1973 when the Knicks won the NBA championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With stars Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu struggling on offense, other players stepped up. Leonie Fiebich started off overtime with a 3-pointer, and then Nyara Sabally had a steal for a layup to make it 65-60 and bring the sellout crowd to a frenzied state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minnesota didn’t score in overtime until Kayla McBride hit two free throws with just under two minutes left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lynx missed all six of their field goal attempts in overtime. After Ionescu missed a shot with 21 seconds left, her 18th miss on 19 shot attempts, the Lynx had one last chance, but Bridget Carleton missed a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stewart, who missed a free throw with 0.8 seconds left in Game 1, hit two free throws with 10.1 seconds left to seal the victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the final seconds ticked off the clock, the players hugged and streamers fell from the rafters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Napheesa Collier scored 22 points to lead Minnesota before fouling out with 13 seconds left in overtime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lynx were trying for a record fifth WNBA title, breaking a tie with the Seattle Storm and Houston Comets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minnesota won four titles from 2011 to 2017 behind the core group of Lindsay Whalen, Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Sylvia Fowles and Maya Moore. That was the team’s last appearance in the WNBA Finals until this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is the first time since 2019 that the WNBA Finals have gone the distance. Since the league switched to a best-of-five format in 2005, seven other series have gone to a Game 5 and the home team has won five of those contests, including in 2019. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An outstanding all-round performance by Amelia Kerr led New Zealand to their first ever Women's T20 World Cup title as they beat South Africa by a commanding 32 runs in Sunday's final in Dubai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Player of the Match Kerr top-scored with 43 as New Zealand posted an imposing 158-5 in their 20 overs before taking 3-24, and crucially picking up the key wickets of Laura Wolvaardt and Anneke Bosch, to restrict South Africa to 126-9 in their 20 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It marked a sweet finish to skipper Sophie Devine's career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The victory came 14 years after the White Ferns lost to Australia by just three runs in the 2010 final. They also lost to England in the 2009 championship match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For South Africa it made for a double disappointment having lost last year's final to Australia in Cape Town. (AFP)

    Cuba's power grid collapses again as storm hits

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cuba's electrical grid collapsed again on Sunday, the fourth such failure in 48 hours, with a hurricane making landfall to compound the island's misery and threaten further havoc on its infrastructure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba earlier on Sunday had said it was making headway restoring service after multiple false starts, though millions of people remained without electricity more than two days after the grid's initial collapse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Restoration work began immediately," the country's energy and mines ministry said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hurricane Oscar made landfall on the Caribbean island on Sunday, bringing strong winds, a powerful storm surge and rain to parts of eastern Cuba and threatening to further complicate the government's efforts to reestablish service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba's meteorological survey warned of "an extremely dangerous situation" in eastern Cuba, while the US National Hurricane Center reported winds of 120 kilometres per hour as the storm made its way across the island.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday, then emerge off the northern coast of Cuba late Monday and cross the central Bahamas on Tuesday," the Hurricane Center said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government canceled school through Wednesday – a near unprecedented move in Cuba – citing the hurricane and the ongoing energy crisis. Officials said only essential workers should report to work on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The repeated grid collapses marked a major setback in the government's efforts to quickly restore power to exhausted residents already suffering from severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The multiple setbacks in the first 48 hours also underscored the complexity of the work and the still precarious state of the country's grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba had restored power to 160,000 clients in Havana just prior to the grid's Sunday collapse, giving some residents a glimmer of hope.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But housewife Anabel Gonzalez, of old Havana, a neighborhood popular with tourists, said she was growing desperate after three days without power.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My cell phone is dead and look at my refrigerator. The little that I had has all gone to waste," she said, pointing to bare shelves in her two-room home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Energy and mines minister Vicente de la O Levy told reporters earlier on Sunday he expected the grid to be fully functional by Monday or Tuesday but warned residents not to expect dramatic improvements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was not immediately clear how much the latest setback would delay the government's efforts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba's national electrical grid first crashed around midday on Friday after the island's largest power plant shut down, sowing chaos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The grid collapsed again on Saturday morning, state-run media reported
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By early evening on Saturday, authorities reported some progress restoring power before announcing another partial grid collapse. (Reuters)

  <img alt="China's central bank has cut the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.10 percent from 3.35 percent, and the five-year LPR has been cut to 3.6 percent from 3.85 percent.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China cut benchmark lending rates as anticipated at the monthly fixing on Monday, following reductions to other policy rates last month as part of a package of stimulus measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR), which constitutes the benchmark for the most advantageous rates lenders can offer to businesses and households, was cut from 3.35 percent to 3.1 percent. The five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage loans, was cut from 3.85 to 3.6 percent. Both rates were last reduced in July and are sitting at all-time lows.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told a financial forum last week lending rates will decrease by 20 to 25 basis points on October 21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC announced cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points on September 24, kicking off the most aggressive stimulus since the pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also cut the medium-term lending facility rate by 30 basis points last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since the September 24 measures, the CSI300 Index has broken records for daily moves and is up more than 14 percent overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Data on Friday showed China's economic growth was slightly better than expected in the third quarter, although property investment fell more than 10 percent in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales and industrial production picked up in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials addressing a press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, and flagged another cut to banks' reserve ratio by the year-end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zhang Zhiwei, President and Chief Economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, said Monday's rate cut was "an encouraging sign". "The monetary policy has clearly shifted to a more supportive stance since the press conference on September 24. The real interest rate in China is too high," he said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Charles Leclerc led Carlos Sainz home as Ferrari claimed a resounding one-two triumph in Sunday's United States Grand Prix after Lando Norris was relegated to fourth, having finished third on track ahead of title rival Max Verstappen who took the third podium spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McLaren's Norris was penalised five seconds for gaining an advantage by leaving the track to pass the series leader and Red Bull's three-time champion on lap 53 of the 56-lap contest and dropped to fourth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verstappen has now extended his lead over Norris to 57 points in the drivers' championship with five races left this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leclerc came home 8.562 sec seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen third, adrift by 19.412 seconds, leaving Norris fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri and George Russell of Mercedes who finished sixth after starting from the pitlane.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg of Haas, Liam Lawson of RB and Franco Colapinto of Williams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Leclerc, it was a first victory in the United States, his third of the season and the eighth of his career while for Ferrari it was a first one-two in American since 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It wasn't an easy weekend up to now, I have been struggling with the feeling with the car, but I had confidence in the race," said Leclerc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am really happy with today, a 1-2 for the team, we couldn't have dreamed for better," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a difficult race for me. I never had the pace to attack and defending was quite difficult with understeer," Verstappen, meanwhile, said after the race. "It was a tough battle and tough to keep Norris behind, but it's a great result."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris made a good initial start from his fourth pole in five races, but left a critical gap on the inside which encouraged Verstappen to attack, forcing them both wide and allowing Leclerc to snatch the lead from fourth on the grid as they came through Turn One. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City snatched a controversial 2-1 win at Wolves as John Stones' last-gasp goal was given after a VAR review to send the champions to the top of the Premier League on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pep Guardiola's side trailed to Jorgen Strand Larsen's surprise opener for Wolves early in the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Josko Gvardiol dragged City back on level terms before the interval and, with just seconds left in stoppage time, Stones headed the visitors to a dramatic sixth win in eight league games this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bottom-of-the-table Wolves claimed Stones' goal should have been disallowed for offside and interference by Bernardo Silva on goalkeeper Jose Sa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm trying to remain calm," Wolves boss Gary O'Neil said. "I have been involved in a few of those and not had many go in our favour."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is some grey area that can go either way and once it was like that I wasn't confident it would go our way," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are a point clear of previous leaders Liverpool, who reclaimed pole position with a victory against Chelsea on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chasing a fifth successive English title, Guardiola's men have set a new club record as their unbeaten run in the league reached 31 games since their loss to Aston Villa in December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In English top-flight history, only six times has a side gone more than 30 matches without losing, most recently Liverpool's run of 44 games from 2019 to 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are not used to winning games at the end, like Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool it many times happened. It is a good flavour for us," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 or 12 games in the Premier League you don't have to see the table, it is just the beginning," Guardioloa added. "But of course it is nice to be winning, you are alive and in that position." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the world's two highest ranked players, brings out the best in both, Sinner said on Saturday after beating Alcaraz in the final of the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner, who won 6-7(5) 6-3 6-3 to bag the US$6 million title, said he hoped for a long rivalry with Alcaraz, after Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic faced off for the final time in the third-place match earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wake up in the morning trying to understand the ways how to beat him. This kind of rivalries, this kind of players, they push us always to our 100 percent," world number one Sinner said in a post-match interview.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hopefully this rivalry will last as long as possible. But there are so many other great players who can jump in – let's see what's coming in the future," the 23-year-old said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy's Sinner and Spain's Alcaraz have won two Grand Slams each this year, with Alcaraz beating Sinner in closely fought clashes at the French Open semi-finals and the China Open final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The off-the-court friends have played each other 10 times on the ATP tour, with 21-year-old Alcaraz winning six matches, including the last three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will do everything so that this rivalry gets better and better – I am happy to share the court with him," four-times Grand Slam winner Alcaraz said. (Reuters)

    'HK ready to extend ban on single-use plastics'

  <img alt="Edwin Lau of The Green Earth says Hong Kong should push ahead with its ban on single-use plastics. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775377_1_20241020185910.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of a green group believes Hong Kong is prepared to extend its ban on single-use plastics, as the six-month adaptation period under the first phase of the ban ends on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules face fines of up to HK$100,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the rules, restaurants are prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hotels are also banned from freely distributing bathroom items made of plastic, including plastic-handled toothbrushes, plastic-packed toothpaste and shower caps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other prohibited products include cotton buds, umbrella bags and glow sticks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said eateries and hotels are generally adapting well to the new regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Through my observation, I gathered that most of the restaurants... I think most of them have done a good job to follow the single-use plastics ban, and they quickly can find the alternative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I am aware that for the hotel industry they are still trying to find an alternative for shower caps. But apart from this item, the rest of the items, I heard them saying that hotels are quite alright in getting all those other alternatives or advising customers to use their own private sets,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second phase, set to begin in 2025, will extend the ban to include plastic cups, food containers for takeouts, as well as plastic dental floss and tablecloths.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lau sees no difficulties for businesses to adjust to the regulations, adding that phase 2 should be rolled out as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I'm sure with the first phase, they have adapted to the changes quite well. And I believe they are well-prepared for the introduction of the second phase of the single-use plastics ban. You can see there are many non-plastic alternatives for takeaway lunch box, congee bowl, and this is no big problem for them,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lau also noted that currently, many alternatives for plastic products are still of the single-use type, and officials should enhance promotion and encourage people to bring their own lunch boxes and cutlery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Environmental Protection Department estimated that the catering sector has cut down on the use of 30 million sets of disposable cutlery since April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the department also noted that 80 percent of customers at chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have decided to stop providing disposable cutlery for takeaways.

    Liverpool beat Chelsea, claim top Premier League spot

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Arne Slot said Liverpool rose to the challenge posed by a step up in opposition after beating Chelsea 2-1 to move back top of the Premier League on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Reds had not faced any of the top nine in the table in their opening seven league games of the season to give Slot a gentle start to the demanding task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool did not have things all their own way at Anfield, but ground out another victory thanks to Mohamed Salah's penalty and Curtis Jones' second-half winner after Nicolas Jackson brought Chelsea level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The better the teams you face the more you need to fight," said Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It helps if you play against a Chelsea, it is a big game and everyone feels it," he added. "We felt it and the fans felt it because they were there for us today. We showed up, that was the most important thing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visit of a confident Chelsea side kicked off a daunting run for Slot's men in the coming months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool face Arsenal, Brighton, Aston Villa and Manchester City in four of their next five Premier League games, as well as Champions League ties against RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid before the end of November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is our biggest test, to play Champions League and Premier League, the hardest games, three days in a row," added Slot. "Many other games were hard but this might have been the hardest maybe because of the amount of quality players they have and the structure they have."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defeat for Chelsea was their first in the league since Enzo Maresca's debut as coach against Manchester City on the opening weekend of the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there were plenty of positives for Maresca as the Blues were a different animal to the side that were thrashed 4-1 on their last visit to Anfield in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We don't like to drop points and lose a game, but if you have to choose a way, this is the way," said Maresca.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We came here and tried to control the game. For most of the game we played in their half and I thought the performance was fantastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I came here many times in the past and I know how difficult it is but the way we controlled and managed the game was fantastic," he added. "This is the right direction." (AFP)

    Pope creates 14 new saints at Vatican ceremony

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775385_1_20241020230107.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis created a new group of saints on Sunday, canonising 14 individuals including the "martyrs of Damascus", killed in Syria during the Ottoman Empire and symbols of Christian persecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis presided over the canonisation ceremony in Saint Peter's Square in the presence of thousands of Catholic faithful from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole Church," proclaimed Francis, after reciting each name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canonisation is the final step towards sainthood in the Catholic Church, following beatification.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three conditions are required -- most crucially that the individual has performed at least two miracles. He or she must be deceased for at least five years and have led an exemplary Christian life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the group are 11 individuals known as the "martyrs of Damascus", who have become saints some 160 years after their death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eight Franciscan friars and three lay Maronites -- all siblings -- from a monastery were assassinated by Druze militants in July 1860 in the Syrian capital, then under Ottoman rule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They were beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1926.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Damascus is home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world but its Christian population has dwindled to only about two percent today, according to the Vatican.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many citizens, Christian and otherwise, have left the city since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The martyrdom of the Damascus group canonised on Sunday "is not very different from the situation of many Christians in the Middle East today", wrote Vatican News, the official news portal of the Vatican.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The other three individuals, who died early in the 20th century, founded religious communities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are Italian missionary Giuseppe Allamano, Italian nun Elena Guerra and the Canadian Marie-Leonie Paradis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In May, Pope Francis announced he would canonise Italian teenager Carlos Acutis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The London-born adolescent spent his life spreading his faith online, earning the moniker "God's Influencer", before dying from leukaemia in 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The date of that canonisation has not yet been set but it could take place in 2025, the Church's Jubilee year, when more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to descend on Rome. (AFP)
